<PRE>&gt;<i>How much free time does everybody think they have to dedicate to Divunal? 
</I>
I don't have alot of free time, but I would like to spend some of the time
I do have on Divunal. I have done very little development outside of
wandering around and playing with my character's clothes etc.

I doubt this was designed to be a text-based game of dress-up.

Honestly, I still feel lost in the world. That's totally my own fault. I
haven't taken enough steps to really immerse myself in the world of the
game. I feel like my character is just kind of standing on the
periphery, not doing anything. 

Glyph/Maxwell and Mike/Jedin showed me around a bit when I first came to
Divunal, but I'd like to wander around a bit with some other &quot;newbies&quot;. If
there are other people who feel similarly, I propose perhaps we try and
explore Divunal and our &quot;abilities&quot; together and develop our characters so
we can actually be an asset to this effort. Please email me privately or
IM me at DivAgatha.

Haley/Agatha
