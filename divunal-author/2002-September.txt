OK, folks, Divunal dev server's back up.  It's been a long damn time in coming.

Telnet on port 8888.  Faucet on port 8788.

Your old-skool Divunal username ought to have been preserved, if you had one.
If not, you can ask me for one.  It's actually still running the old old old
map, just to prove we can *do* that.  It's a representative chunk of test data,
and we can steal bits from it, at any rate.

A question asked on IRC that I missed:

> <dash> glyph: think an IThing interface is ok, so's we can have actions that
> work on anything?

Well, this line from simple.py answers the question, really:

    registerAdapter(Inedible, Thing, IEatTarget)

if you register an adapter for Thing, then it's the adapter you get back 90% of
the time.  If you want an action to work on anything, the default response to
the action should be factored like this, I think.  Is there a case where you
wouldn't want it to be?

well, my thought was that containment-oriented verbs (get, put, etc.)
should accept any Thing as their target. I guess one could register an
adapter like that, it just didn't seem to be the right way to do
it. Are you recommending "registerAdapter(Thing, Thing, ITakeTarget)"? 
Of course, the _current_ way i'm doing it with "take" is obviously
wrong, now:

Thing.__implements__ += (ITakeTarget,)

oh, and another thing: i was laboring under the mistaken notion that
subclasses inherited interfaces from their superclasses. So what I was
planning to do wouldn't have worked anyway.

Well, Moshe caused me to spend a few minutes thinking about writing fiction,
which I am constitutionally unable to separate from game design at this point
in my life, and inspiration struck in the form of this fragment of a
dramatization of a gameplay session:

    http://zelda.twistedmatrix.com/hourglass.xhtml

I hope to take this further, but I thought it might be an interesting read.

I'd also be interested in this as a test of zero-story.  What do you think is
going on in this story? :)

I really enjoyed this short introduction. It's kind of like
sci-fi/mystery, from what I gather, based on the "solve the problem" 
style. Very IF-ish, anyway :)

So I strongly encourage you to continue it. It would be cool to develop
stories like this in parallel with the game world, although I wonder if
it would interfere with the zero-story philosophy of the game. From what
I can gather of your past descriptions of the idea, it was that the
story developed in the game, and this is story developed outside of the
game. I like it, and I doubt it's a bad thing, so I'm just playing
devil's advocate in order to refine the philosophy in my head :)

Yes.  It's almost as much a game-design document as a work of fiction.  I'm
trying to imagine what people like the characters we're designing would really
be _doing_, what their emotional tone would be like, etc.

Notice that they don't understand the world they live in in very concrete
terms, but they are pretty fearless in experimenting with it.  I am pretty
happy with how I captured that in the first few pages and I hope to take it
further.

Thanks!

No, I don't think so.  See, this isn't a story about primal or world-defining
characters: just some divuen going about their daily lives.  In fact, they're
not even members of an older or more powerful civilization; they're "regular"
people. :).  So it's not _THE_ story of the game world, it's _A_ story in the
game world.  Perhaps some of the story will tangentially affect the game world,
inspire the design of puzzles, etc.  It will not drive the design of the game.

It's not where the story develops that I was trying to change: in fact, my idea
was that most of the story would actually happen on message boards and in chat
rooms, as players discussed the ramifications of the things happening to their
avatars.

It was _how_ the story developed that I wanted to change.  Rather than creating
a single, global, compelling story, and then deriving mechanics from that, we
create compelling mechanics and then derive a whole multitude of stories from
it.  Hopefully a lot of those stories will be good -- I also expect some of
them will contradict in their explanations of the significance of various
features of the world.

Well, I'm glad you asked.

I hope that the story that I've started to tell hasn't been a violation of the
basic tenets I put down: I am trying to keep the basic mechanics and aesthetic
sense of the game world that we have described elsewhere consistently
represented and not really explained.  The story is designed to be a character
study into a few typical people with the bodies and minds of young immortals
hungry for new experiences.

If it has been, I'd like to try to clear that up, and eliminate any sense of
primacy or cardinality in the world among the characters in the story :).  I
don't think it's even long enough for me to have screwed up that badly
though... so we'll see if I can keep it up.

(I would highly recommend the trade paperback comic series "Planetary" for
anyone who has not read it, speaking of "immortals hungry for new
experiences"...)
