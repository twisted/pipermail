Subject: [Divunal-author] Do you want your possessions identified?

Are there still people out there who want to work on divunal?

Currently my list is:

	* Mr. Short
	* Glyph
	* Tenth

The project's previous incarnation has been declared dead, I believe (It's
been more than one year since any significant contribution was made by
*anyone*), and we're starting with a fresh codebase and probably a majorly
revised design and plot.

Thanks for playing!
