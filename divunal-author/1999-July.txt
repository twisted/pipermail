Subject: [Divunal-author]please read the author webpages

The general reasons:

	We work on them a lot.  They contain lots of useful information
about the game.  it's a central repository for information. you can email
us updates and additions in HTML if you want to add or change something,
and then hopefully everyone else will see it.  It's courteous.  It saves
us time. Really, I mean this stuff.  (And nobody seems to be reading them,
from the types of questions that I've been getting lately... speaking of
which, if you *do* have a question, don't hesitate to ask Tenth (Dave)
because he knows as much, if not more, about Divunal than I do.)

The specific reason:

	Someone has been having a good time changing my character's
clothes and items around, to things which he would not normally posess or
wear. I've fixed them all now, but in the future, that's considered highly
rude.  It says so on the author page, in rather repetitive language.  
This is sort of one of the rules of being an author... Screwing with
another author's character is about as intrusive as you can get.

	Anyway, I'm not going to start logging or anything, I'll trust
that whoever was playing with my stuff will stop, (I don't want you to
`confess', please just start reading the guidelines we've put out!) and we
can continue having a good time...

	Have a nice day,

Subject: [Divunal-author]you may have noticed some changes

I've updated the Divunal TR server code to the most recent CVS snapshot,
which is disturbingly similiar to what will be the 1.0 release of the
code.

Differences will probably not be easily apparent.  This is good.  The
differences which you *will* notice are bugs:

	"take" and "drop" no longer figure out that you're talking about
the thing that you are or are not carrying.  This is actually a
preparation for a larger fix, since the only critereon for clarifying
which object was intended in the past was implemented as a kludge nailed
on to a bug in the way that objects were found in general. (and you could
only specify the location of an object as the critereon)

	In the future, objects will be selectable by a variety of
criterea.  I'm working on a simple API to overlay this now.

	PLAIN ENGLISH TRANSLATION:

It used to be so you could say "take foo" and it would know that if you
were carrying a foo and there was a foo on the ground, you meant the foo
on the ground.

There was no way, however, to write a verb in such a way as to have "take
foo" figure out that you would never mean anything in your inventory BUT
you could mean anything from anywhere else.

Now there is, although it is not currently being done anywhere.  I hope to
have correctly functioning versions of "take" and "drop" by the end of the
week.

Subject: [Divunal-author]JIT Documentation

The documentation is in pretty good shape right now, it provides a good
introduction to the design philosophy we're trying to follow and a number
of facts about the world.

However, it's impossible to maintain this documentation without feedback.

If you have a question about something divunal-related, don't hesitate to
ask ... if the documentation is already available, depending on how easy
it is to access, we may politely guide you to it or just reply with a
curt 'RTFM', but if it's not, we will make haste to prepare some
information on it, and put it on the website.

Of course, this is subject to change if we get 1000 requests for
documentation within a week, but it's a place to start.

In other words, neither I nor Dave will be working on any documentation
until we are requested to do so, then we will do that specific
documentation and get back to working on world-stuff.

Anybody willing to write docs by asking us questions is is welcome to do
so, and we will integrate them into the website (by hand) if you email
them to us.  We will likely just look them over for consistency.

Eventually, we will need an automated process for doing this, but I think
at this juncture that would just be a waste of time ... a database backend
for the trivial amount of data currently in there would be overkill and we
could better spend it writing pieces of the game.

Anyway, tootles!

Subject: [Divunal-author]Ping!

Wow, this list has been dead for a while!

Apologies, everyone, we have had *three messages* (count them) aside from
this one for this month.

If anyone has any comments, questions, new features, feature requests, new
areas, requests for information about areas, etcetera, PLEASE send them on
to the list!  Projects like this one thrive on activity.  Tenth and I
needed a bit of a break, but it was disheartening to see the everyone in
the entire project just stop immediately after we ceased posting
announcements to this list...

That said, I've been working on a few new areas, Divunal's moved to a new
server, and we're about ready to release Twisted Reality 1.0... one of the
big things holding us up is a lack of testers!  Of course, more people
will sign up when we release, so a GNOME-style 1.0 release might be the
only option.

The most interesting area I've been working on lately is the temple of the
archetypes.  It's a sort of combination of a civic center and a place of
worship.  Each of the archetypes has a small wing dedicated to them,
usually used for something applicable to that archetype.  Very little of
it is done so far, I've been doing sketches and trying to map out the
areas so they make some sense spatially.

Anybody who's doing an archetype representative character, I'd like to
hear your opinions on what your character's area should be like...

John's is the only one that's really set so far.  It's a room somewhat
like a christian church, where people can go to hear "sermons"
(philosophical speeches and stories) and there will be a room for
psychological counseling of some sort.

(Jedin, Maxwell, and Tenth's archetypes, representing past, present, and
future, respectively, are all in one room, at the top of the temple.  
That room is used for something that will be explained later...)

Hope to hear back from y'all soon.

I'd still like to hear who's working on what in regard to fixing verbs.

I've been doing a lot of thinking about the history, geography, people,
etc. of Divunal--basically, world design.  I think I'm getting pretty
close to having things together enough to give a "presentation".  I don't
want to give details until I can present an entire package, but the issues
I've been focusing are setting up a world that can be interesting w/o us
having to constantly monitor it and establishing a technological
environment that's consistent yet still interesting, while still remaining
true to the history that's already been developed and making future
creation easy.

I *strongly* suggest that people take some time to look at art,
particularly the good 3D art sites that are out there.  They can provide a
lot of inspiration for areas and items, moreso even than most books.
Here's a site that I found very handy; I'll send more when I get the
chance:
