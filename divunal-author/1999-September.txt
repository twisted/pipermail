Subject: [Divunal-author]syntax and ambiguity

I've been wandering around the map quite a bit lately, and I thought I'd
share this authoring observations with the community at large:

When you're making a manipulable object, keep in mind not only what you
want the object to do, but how this behavior is to be invoked.  The best
way to test this is to ask lots of people to play-test your objects.

This leads me to the inference that we require more play-testers, but I'm
sure a release on Freshmeat and a note on the web-page to that effect will
resolve that problem :-)

I tend to idolize Infocom's series of games because I grew up with them --
however, I've succeeded too far in my goals to re-create the flavor of
those games.  We have copied some of the flaws, too.  Luckily, we have the
time to *fix* these flaws before we release.

The flaw I am talking about is "fighting with the parser".  This is
universally the most complained-about facet of Infocom's interactive
fiction archive.  (Oh, I was supposed to TURN THE SPLENDIFEROUS DARK CYAN
KNOB TO THE RIGHT not OPEN BLUE DOOR, etcetera...)  To some degree, our
parser is easier to use because it presents a more consistent interface
(to those willing to read the documentation and pay attention to it).  On
the other hand, specific puzzles are sometimes difficult to navigate.

In the "Smoking Room" [rikyu; library] there is a Lion's Head that must be
*turned*.  It cannot be pushed, pulled, or twisted.  Also, it cannot be
referred to as the "head", only as the "lion's head", nor as 'lion'.  All
of these things should be enabled if it is to be an interesting,
interactive puzzle.

Especially, verbs which aren't "quite right" should cause things to
happen.  If a user were to try and push or pull or touch the lion's head,
something slightly unusual should happen to let them know it's possible to
do something with it (that it's a 'special' object in some way.)  Also,
things like 'push' and 'pull', which are pretty close to the mark, should
give you've-almost-got-it messages such as, "As you attempt to pull on the
lion's head, you notice that it gives slightly and almost imperceptibly to
the left."  (Try to vary those messages a bit, too, so they don't try four
different things and notice that the head has moved a mile and a half to
the left, but always by the same increment.)  Depending on the intended
difficulty level of the puzzle, you may want to put in some additional
hint info there too.  (You notice the head [twists/turns] slightly to the
[left/right].)

Finally, give the user feedback when they do something, especially solving
a puzzle.  If it's likely to have been a hard puzzle with a lot of
brain-work and some trial and error, don't be afraid to be emphatic.  (In
the formerly seamless wall, a door swings open, leading into an abyssal
darkness!)

Another good example of this is something Tenth recently changed.  The
cockroach (occasionally present in the Demo center) had a "wind" verb.
Players tried to 'unlock' the roach with the key, so he made that wind the
roach once, and give the players a descriptive message.  The action of
"unlocking", in this case, would probably be the same as winding the roach
just once, so that's what he made it do, along with some helpful hints to 
the user.

I think that listing verbs would be a very bad idea, and except for the
first few, players should be mostly "in the dark", but this does mean that
the onus is on us, as authors, to make sure that if the players try the
right thing, it works.  So grab those thesuaruses, everybody.  More
importantly, have your areas tested by actual players ... if anyone wants
to start bringing playtesters on board, now would be a good time.

Thanks for listening...

Subject: [Divunal-author]How's Your Free Time?

I'd like to take an informal poll of authors:

How much free time does everybody think they have to dedicate to Divunal?

If you really have none, or you're not actually authoring for the game,
you don't have to respond. I will assume that anyone on this list who does
*not* respond to this message in the next week is not going to do any work
on the publicly released version of Divunal, which should happen sometime
between January and March this year.

I'd really appreciate it if everybody involved would respond to this
promptly.  We've been really disorganized so far.  That can do a lot for
quick bursts of creative energy for getting the framework in place
quickly, but now we have mature world-building software and a pretty good
idea of where we want the game to go, so we're at the phase of the design
where we are going to start putting up lists of things for people to do
and waiting until they're done.  Knowing what resources we have at our
disposal will be a useful tool in deciding how to run the project moving
forward. It would also be nice to know how much effort we should put
toward garnering *more* resources.

Just so you know, our current list goes something like this:

	* Renovate Castle Greysen and complete the puzzles involved with
	the East and West Wings

	* Finish Tenth's House, do all of the puzzles there

	* Finish Damien's Office, correct some of the stylistic elements
	
	* Finish Rikyu's tea-thing (and find out what puzzles are supposed
	to be in it!  It *looks* cool, but it's also kinda random.)

This is in a state of flux and what other objectives make it on to the
list depends pretty heavily on what the response to this message looks
like.

I would also like to stress that this message is not intended to determine
the reasons for people's level of contribution (or lack thereof) so please
no sob-stories :-).

If you must err one way or another though, please be sure to err on the
side of getting less done -- I'd rather be ahead of schedule than behind,
but try not to err too much -- it would be impossible to make a schedule
otherwise.

Thanks!

Thanks, Ben!

Just so everybody knows: if you are sending mail from an address which is
not subscribed requires Dave to manually OK each message.  We have some
pretty spiffy web-based mailinglist administration software, so if you've
been using different email addresses, please visit the page:

http://www.twistedmatrix.com/mailman/listinfo/divunal-author

which appears at the bottom of every list mail, and enter your
subscription email (the one you recieve this message at).

If you are prompted for a username and password upon visiting the page,
enter your Divunal Author Website username and password. (This is mostly
to make sure unauthorized people can't browse the mailinglist archive)

You can get your list password emailed to you (this is different from the
divunal website password) once you're on your personal list administration
page (after you've entered your subscription email and hit "Edit
Options").

I would recommend unsubscribing unused email addresses and subscribing the
ones you normally use.  Thanks.

If people need help with CVS accounts (which I assume nearly everybody
does, since I completely restructured the server) please get in touch with
me personally, and I'll develop a tutorial after the first two or three
people have checked out the stuff.  (If you're on windows, expect this to
take an hour or two ... I don't know my way around too well)

Also, for you aspiring authors out there:

This is a concise guide to the correct use of the apostrophe.  I found it
very, very funny.

walkthrough of Things, Naming Conventions, Referencing, Apparent Names,
Descriptions, Locations, Containers, Rooms, Component Objects, Player
Characters, Doors, and Clothes. Hopefully it should keep our new authors
busy for a while.  :-)

Feel free to email me if you have any questions/concerns/problems/requests

something similar for the Verb Authoring documentation this weekend, as

I don't have alot of free time, but I would like to spend some of the time
I do have on Divunal. I have done very little development outside of
wandering around and playing with my character's clothes etc.

I doubt this was designed to be a text-based game of dress-up.

Honestly, I still feel lost in the world. That's totally my own fault. I
haven't taken enough steps to really immerse myself in the world of the
game. I feel like my character is just kind of standing on the
periphery, not doing anything. 

Glyph/Maxwell and Mike/Jedin showed me around a bit when I first came to
Divunal, but I'd like to wander around a bit with some other "newbies". If
there are other people who feel similarly, I propose perhaps we try and
explore Divunal and our "abilities" together and develop our characters so
we can actually be an asset to this effort. Please email me privately or
IM me at DivAgatha.

The contact thing I put up on the Authoring Page was just something I

Subject: [Divunal-author]syntax and ambiguity

I've been wandering around the map quite a bit lately, and I thought I'd
share this authoring observations with the community at large:

When you're making a manipulable object, keep in mind not only what you
want the object to do, but how this behavior is to be invoked.  The best
way to test this is to ask lots of people to play-test your objects.

This leads me to the inference that we require more play-testers, but I'm
sure a release on Freshmeat and a note on the web-page to that effect will
resolve that problem :-)

I tend to idolize Infocom's series of games because I grew up with them --
however, I've succeeded too far in my goals to re-create the flavor of
those games.  We have copied some of the flaws, too.  Luckily, we have the
time to *fix* these flaws before we release.

The flaw I am talking about is "fighting with the parser".  This is
universally the most complained-about facet of Infocom's interactive
fiction archive.  (Oh, I was supposed to TURN THE SPLENDIFEROUS DARK CYAN
KNOB TO THE RIGHT not OPEN BLUE DOOR, etcetera...)  To some degree, our
parser is easier to use because it presents a more consistent interface
(to those willing to read the documentation and pay attention to it).  On
the other hand, specific puzzles are sometimes difficult to navigate.

In the "Smoking Room" [rikyu; library] there is a Lion's Head that must be
*turned*.  It cannot be pushed, pulled, or twisted.  Also, it cannot be
referred to as the "head", only as the "lion's head", nor as 'lion'.  All
of these things should be enabled if it is to be an interesting,
interactive puzzle.

Especially, verbs which aren't "quite right" should cause things to
happen.  If a user were to try and push or pull or touch the lion's head,
something slightly unusual should happen to let them know it's possible to
do something with it (that it's a 'special' object in some way.)  Also,
things like 'push' and 'pull', which are pretty close to the mark, should
give you've-almost-got-it messages such as, "As you attempt to pull on the
lion's head, you notice that it gives slightly and almost imperceptibly to
the left."  (Try to vary those messages a bit, too, so they don't try four
different things and notice that the head has moved a mile and a half to
the left, but always by the same increment.)  Depending on the intended
difficulty level of the puzzle, you may want to put in some additional
hint info there too.  (You notice the head [twists/turns] slightly to the
[left/right].)

Finally, give the user feedback when they do something, especially solving
a puzzle.  If it's likely to have been a hard puzzle with a lot of
brain-work and some trial and error, don't be afraid to be emphatic.  (In
the formerly seamless wall, a door swings open, leading into an abyssal
darkness!)

Another good example of this is something Tenth recently changed.  The
cockroach (occasionally present in the Demo center) had a "wind" verb.
Players tried to 'unlock' the roach with the key, so he made that wind the
roach once, and give the players a descriptive message.  The action of
"unlocking", in this case, would probably be the same as winding the roach
just once, so that's what he made it do, along with some helpful hints to 
the user.

I think that listing verbs would be a very bad idea, and except for the
first few, players should be mostly "in the dark", but this does mean that
the onus is on us, as authors, to make sure that if the players try the
right thing, it works.  So grab those thesuaruses, everybody.  More
importantly, have your areas tested by actual players ... if anyone wants
to start bringing playtesters on board, now would be a good time.

Thanks for listening...

Subject: [Divunal-author]How's Your Free Time?

I'd like to take an informal poll of authors:

How much free time does everybody think they have to dedicate to Divunal?

If you really have none, or you're not actually authoring for the game,
you don't have to respond. I will assume that anyone on this list who does
*not* respond to this message in the next week is not going to do any work
on the publicly released version of Divunal, which should happen sometime
between January and March this year.

I'd really appreciate it if everybody involved would respond to this
promptly.  We've been really disorganized so far.  That can do a lot for
quick bursts of creative energy for getting the framework in place
quickly, but now we have mature world-building software and a pretty good
idea of where we want the game to go, so we're at the phase of the design
where we are going to start putting up lists of things for people to do
and waiting until they're done.  Knowing what resources we have at our
disposal will be a useful tool in deciding how to run the project moving
forward. It would also be nice to know how much effort we should put
toward garnering *more* resources.

Just so you know, our current list goes something like this:

	* Renovate Castle Greysen and complete the puzzles involved with
	the East and West Wings

	* Finish Tenth's House, do all of the puzzles there

	* Finish Damien's Office, correct some of the stylistic elements
	
	* Finish Rikyu's tea-thing (and find out what puzzles are supposed
	to be in it!  It *looks* cool, but it's also kinda random.)

This is in a state of flux and what other objectives make it on to the
list depends pretty heavily on what the response to this message looks
like.

I would also like to stress that this message is not intended to determine
the reasons for people's level of contribution (or lack thereof) so please
no sob-stories :-).

If you must err one way or another though, please be sure to err on the
side of getting less done -- I'd rather be ahead of schedule than behind,
but try not to err too much -- it would be impossible to make a schedule
otherwise.

Thanks!

Thanks, Ben!

Just so everybody knows: if you are sending mail from an address which is
not subscribed requires Dave to manually OK each message.  We have some
pretty spiffy web-based mailinglist administration software, so if you've
been using different email addresses, please visit the page:

http://www.twistedmatrix.com/mailman/listinfo/divunal-author

which appears at the bottom of every list mail, and enter your
subscription email (the one you recieve this message at).

If you are prompted for a username and password upon visiting the page,
enter your Divunal Author Website username and password. (This is mostly
to make sure unauthorized people can't browse the mailinglist archive)

You can get your list password emailed to you (this is different from the
divunal website password) once you're on your personal list administration
page (after you've entered your subscription email and hit "Edit
Options").

I would recommend unsubscribing unused email addresses and subscribing the
ones you normally use.  Thanks.

If people need help with CVS accounts (which I assume nearly everybody
does, since I completely restructured the server) please get in touch with
me personally, and I'll develop a tutorial after the first two or three
people have checked out the stuff.  (If you're on windows, expect this to
take an hour or two ... I don't know my way around too well)

Also, for you aspiring authors out there:

I don't have alot of free time, but I would like to spend some of the time
I do have on Divunal. I have done very little development outside of
wandering around and playing with my character's clothes etc.

I doubt this was designed to be a text-based game of dress-up.

Honestly, I still feel lost in the world. That's totally my own fault. I
haven't taken enough steps to really immerse myself in the world of the
game. I feel like my character is just kind of standing on the
periphery, not doing anything. 

Glyph/Maxwell and Mike/Jedin showed me around a bit when I first came to
Divunal, but I'd like to wander around a bit with some other "newbies". If
there are other people who feel similarly, I propose perhaps we try and
explore Divunal and our "abilities" together and develop our characters so
we can actually be an asset to this effort. Please email me privately or
IM me at DivAgatha.

The contact thing I put up on the Authoring Page was just something I

Subject: [Divunal-author]syntax and ambiguity

I've been wandering around the map quite a bit lately, and I thought I'd
share this authoring observations with the community at large:

When you're making a manipulable object, keep in mind not only what you
want the object to do, but how this behavior is to be invoked.  The best
way to test this is to ask lots of people to play-test your objects.

This leads me to the inference that we require more play-testers, but I'm
sure a release on Freshmeat and a note on the web-page to that effect will
resolve that problem :-)

I tend to idolize Infocom's series of games because I grew up with them --
however, I've succeeded too far in my goals to re-create the flavor of
those games.  We have copied some of the flaws, too.  Luckily, we have the
time to *fix* these flaws before we release.

The flaw I am talking about is "fighting with the parser".  This is
universally the most complained-about facet of Infocom's interactive
fiction archive.  (Oh, I was supposed to TURN THE SPLENDIFEROUS DARK CYAN
KNOB TO THE RIGHT not OPEN BLUE DOOR, etcetera...)  To some degree, our
parser is easier to use because it presents a more consistent interface
(to those willing to read the documentation and pay attention to it).  On
the other hand, specific puzzles are sometimes difficult to navigate.

In the "Smoking Room" [rikyu; library] there is a Lion's Head that must be
*turned*.  It cannot be pushed, pulled, or twisted.  Also, it cannot be
referred to as the "head", only as the "lion's head", nor as 'lion'.  All
of these things should be enabled if it is to be an interesting,
interactive puzzle.

Especially, verbs which aren't "quite right" should cause things to
happen.  If a user were to try and push or pull or touch the lion's head,
something slightly unusual should happen to let them know it's possible to
do something with it (that it's a 'special' object in some way.)  Also,
things like 'push' and 'pull', which are pretty close to the mark, should
give you've-almost-got-it messages such as, "As you attempt to pull on the
lion's head, you notice that it gives slightly and almost imperceptibly to
the left."  (Try to vary those messages a bit, too, so they don't try four
different things and notice that the head has moved a mile and a half to
the left, but always by the same increment.)  Depending on the intended
difficulty level of the puzzle, you may want to put in some additional
hint info there too.  (You notice the head [twists/turns] slightly to the
[left/right].)

Finally, give the user feedback when they do something, especially solving
a puzzle.  If it's likely to have been a hard puzzle with a lot of
brain-work and some trial and error, don't be afraid to be emphatic.  (In
the formerly seamless wall, a door swings open, leading into an abyssal
darkness!)

Another good example of this is something Tenth recently changed.  The
cockroach (occasionally present in the Demo center) had a "wind" verb.
Players tried to 'unlock' the roach with the key, so he made that wind the
roach once, and give the players a descriptive message.  The action of
"unlocking", in this case, would probably be the same as winding the roach
just once, so that's what he made it do, along with some helpful hints to 
the user.

I think that listing verbs would be a very bad idea, and except for the
first few, players should be mostly "in the dark", but this does mean that
the onus is on us, as authors, to make sure that if the players try the
right thing, it works.  So grab those thesuaruses, everybody.  More
importantly, have your areas tested by actual players ... if anyone wants
to start bringing playtesters on board, now would be a good time.

Thanks for listening...

If you really have none, or you're not actually authoring for the game,
you don't have to respond. I will assume that anyone on this list who does
*not* respond to this message in the next week is not going to do any work
on the publicly released version of Divunal, which should happen sometime
between January and March this year.

I'd really appreciate it if everybody involved would respond to this
promptly.  We've been really disorganized so far.  That can do a lot for
quick bursts of creative energy for getting the framework in place
quickly, but now we have mature world-building software and a pretty good
idea of where we want the game to go, so we're at the phase of the design
where we are going to start putting up lists of things for people to do
and waiting until they're done.  Knowing what resources we have at our
disposal will be a useful tool in deciding how to run the project moving
forward. It would also be nice to know how much effort we should put
toward garnering *more* resources.

Just so you know, our current list goes something like this:

	* Renovate Castle Greysen and complete the puzzles involved with
	the East and West Wings

	* Finish Tenth's House, do all of the puzzles there

	* Finish Damien's Office, correct some of the stylistic elements
	
	* Finish Rikyu's tea-thing (and find out what puzzles are supposed
	to be in it!  It *looks* cool, but it's also kinda random.)

This is in a state of flux and what other objectives make it on to the
list depends pretty heavily on what the response to this message looks
like.

I would also like to stress that this message is not intended to determine
the reasons for people's level of contribution (or lack thereof) so please
no sob-stories :-).

If you must err one way or another though, please be sure to err on the
side of getting less done -- I'd rather be ahead of schedule than behind,
but try not to err too much -- it would be impossible to make a schedule
otherwise.

Thanks!

Thanks, Ben!

Just so everybody knows: if you are sending mail from an address which is
not subscribed requires Dave to manually OK each message.  We have some
pretty spiffy web-based mailinglist administration software, so if you've
been using different email addresses, please visit the page:

http://www.twistedmatrix.com/mailman/listinfo/divunal-author

which appears at the bottom of every list mail, and enter your
subscription email (the one you recieve this message at).

If you are prompted for a username and password upon visiting the page,
enter your Divunal Author Website username and password. (This is mostly
to make sure unauthorized people can't browse the mailinglist archive)

You can get your list password emailed to you (this is different from the
divunal website password) once you're on your personal list administration
page (after you've entered your subscription email and hit "Edit
Options").

I would recommend unsubscribing unused email addresses and subscribing the
ones you normally use.  Thanks.

If people need help with CVS accounts (which I assume nearly everybody
does, since I completely restructured the server) please get in touch with
me personally, and I'll develop a tutorial after the first two or three
people have checked out the stuff.  (If you're on windows, expect this to
take an hour or two ... I don't know my way around too well)

Also, for you aspiring authors out there:

This is a concise guide to the correct use of the apostrophe.  I found it
very, very funny.

Unfortunately, this is the map-file I had to restore yesterday, after we
suffered a power-outage here at DCIT.  This was mostly due to a
configuration error on my part (I didn't put the pump in the auto-startup

Subject: [Divunal-author]New Authoring Tutorial!

I just added a newer, clearer, more comprehensive tutorial to basic
authoring to the Authoring page. You can also visit it directly at

	http://www.twistedmatrix.com/authors/creation.html

This should hopefully address the concerns that the current authoring docs
aren't clear or comprehensive enough; The new page is a step by step
walkthrough of Things, Naming Conventions, Referencing, Apparent Names,
Descriptions, Locations, Containers, Rooms, Component Objects, Player
Characters, Doors, and Clothes. Hopefully it should keep our new authors
busy for a while.  :-)

Feel free to email me if you have any questions/concerns/problems/requests
regarding the new page... That's what I'm here for. ;-) I'm going to do
something similar for the Verb Authoring documentation this weekend, as
well as the encyclopedia and overview of Divunal society.

Thanks,

- Tenth

Subject: [Divunal-author]How's Your Free Time?

>How much free time does everybody think they have to dedicate to Divunal? 

I don't have alot of free time, but I would like to spend some of the time
I do have on Divunal. I have done very little development outside of
wandering around and playing with my character's clothes etc.

I doubt this was designed to be a text-based game of dress-up.

Honestly, I still feel lost in the world. That's totally my own fault. I
haven't taken enough steps to really immerse myself in the world of the
game. I feel like my character is just kind of standing on the
periphery, not doing anything. 

Glyph/Maxwell and Mike/Jedin showed me around a bit when I first came to
Divunal, but I'd like to wander around a bit with some other "newbies". If
there are other people who feel similarly, I propose perhaps we try and
explore Divunal and our "abilities" together and develop our characters so
we can actually be an asset to this effort. Please email me privately or
IM me at DivAgatha.

I just put up a page for my friend Jim at:

It is intended for Jim, but it might be of interest all of you other
author-types because Jim is one of the people working on music for
Divunal, and this is the page where we will be giving him requests and
(eventually) feedback. If you have any requests or ideas for music that
you'd like the Divunal CD to have (assuming we ever get enough music
together to warrant one) let me know and I'll add them to the page.

After talking to a few of our newer authors, I noticed that a lot of our

anyone have any objection to me putting up a list of all the Authors,
their addresses, and their AOLIM names on the Authoring Page? I think this
might make it easier for new people to get to know everyone else, and make
it easier for us to help each other out.

Sure, that sounds like a good idea.
My name is Haley Miller, I am a senior CS major at Smith.
I am not a NEW author per se but my involvement in the project has been
rather peripheral until recently.

My character Agatha is an astronomer/navigator who has basically no back
story (but I'm working on it :) )

My AOL IM names are PhenxRysng and DivAgatha. Feel free to IM me or to
email me.

haley

ps perhaps we should have profiles of ALL the authors on the author
resource page. I'll set up a form and collect the data, etc. Would people
mind having names, emails, IMs/ICQ and a very brief character profile on
the authors page?

The contact thing I put up on the Authoring Page was just something I
jotted down after mentioning the idea on the mailing list... Everyone 
should use Haley's form instead. It's much cooler than mine, and will be
replacing it soon anyway.  ;-)

Everybody who's an author on Divunal is technically entitled to an account
on Zaibach, and I'd like it if you were all there so if I refer to
something in CVS or in a directory somewhere you can just go and get it
=).

It's not really strictly *necessary*, but if you'd like such an account,
please contact me and let me know sometime soon ...
