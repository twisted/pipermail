<PRE>Okay, here is how you make socials. Sorry its not too verbose but hopefull
you can figure it out....if not, go read the code. :) Any of the fields can
be omitted, in which case the message just won't be sent then. (ie if you
can't use this social on an object, just put &quot;cfoundobj Silly you can't do
that&quot; and don't specify a ofoundobj). Note that c=character v=victim
o=other in the field names.

Escape codes for use in social strings:
$$ = $ (two dollar signs together makes one in the output)
$[12]n = name of [person/target]
$[12]s = his/her of [person/target]
$[12]m = him/her of [person/target]
$[12]e = he/she of [person/target]

 Example of a socials.txt file... &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
#bite
hidden false
cnoarg You nervously gnaw at your lower lip.
onoarg $1n gnaws nervously at $s lower lip.
cfound You bite $2n!
vfound $1n bites you!
ofound $1n bites $2n!
notfound You can't bite someone who isn't here.
cself You bite yourself on the arm!
oself $1n bites himself on the arm!
ofoundobj $1n bites $2n savagely.  Run you fool!!  Rabid $1n on the loose!
cfoundobj You foam at the mouth and bite the $2n, with a crazed and rabid
look in your eyes.

#smile
hidden true
&lt;etc...&gt;

&lt;more socials.....&gt;

#END
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; end example file
hidden is whether someone who can't see you will see the social happen.
Smile e.g. would be hidden. Scream would not.
