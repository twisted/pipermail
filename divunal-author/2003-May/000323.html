    &gt; It makes sense to me - the formatting component can be a
    &gt; different component, if you _really_ want your concerns
    &gt; separated, but we do have the notion of objects knowing how to
    &gt; describe themselves dynamically rather than being given static
    &gt; descriptions.

This brings up the question of formatting descriptions beyond raw
strings. I've occasionally had the idea that descriptions should be
Woven templates but i'm not sure how great of a concept that is.

    &gt; This does place more of a burden on the programmer, but
    &gt; hopefully once we've got our writing hats on we can go through
    &gt; and clean up a lot of the descriptive text.

I suppose i'm still thinking of a division between
&quot;description-writing person&quot; and &quot;code-writing person&quot;, but for us
that's going to be a pretty minimal problem, true.

    &gt; We should probably discuss his advice here.  Some of the things
    &gt; he suggests are peculiar to a linear, directed plot (which we
    &gt; don't have) and some are specific to a very slow-paced
    &gt; single-player experience.  While we should be pushing online
    &gt; gaming closer to those goals, we do have to make some
    &gt; concessions to the fact that the game is real-time and
    &gt; open-ended.

    &gt; Examining each point he makes for its context with respect to
    &gt; these ideas might yield some new and interesting conventions we
    &gt; could follow.

Specifically, i was reading
<A HREF="http://www.inform-fiction.org/manual/html/s51.html">http://www.inform-fiction.org/manual/html/s51.html</A> -- the advice given
there seems pretty universal. 

    &gt;&gt; In specific, i wish two things were done differently:

    &gt;&gt; 1) not defaulting to listing exits by name and direction (I
    &gt;&gt; want to do this in the description)

    &gt; I don't have an answer here yet, but I'm thinking that this is a
    &gt; questionable UI decision.  Having them listed twice might make
    &gt; sense (though in the telnet interface there should be a visual
    &gt; distinction between &quot;textual description&quot; and &quot;spatial layout
    &gt; information&quot;).  Players are going to have the ability to add
    &gt; additional exits to almost any room, and someone moving through
    &gt; the map quickly could easily miss the existence of an exit.

True, though arguably adding those new exits to the description should
be enough.

    &gt; Of course, I have no problem with rewarding attentiveness, but I
    &gt; would rather make only things that would be non-obvious to a
    &gt; casual observer in a real environment be non-obvious to a player
    &gt; who is only skimming descriptions.

Hmm. I hadn't thought of that, but it's a good sort of proportionality
to aim for.

    &gt; The inventory list should list all _portable_ items, methinks.

Probably.

I'm mainly thinking of these issues as a reaction against the horribly
flat descriptions prevalent in most MUDs. 

&quot;You are standing on a road winding through the desert. 
Exits: north south east west 
Contents: There is a rock here. There is a gnoll here. There is a
spatula here.&quot;

Perhaps there's a compromise that can be struck between literary room
descriptions and utilitarian ones. I expect practice will yield the
best results.
