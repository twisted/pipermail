<PRE>We've been inactive for some time ... a bit of an explanation has been
posted on <A HREF="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/.">http://www.twistedmatrix.com/.</A>

This does not mean we're going to stop working on Inheritance or Divunal.
It is just an indication that eventually we will put a LOT of work into
both of them.

Authoring is still open season -- please feel free to do it if you have
time! :-)  The library still needs lots of work.

As always, let me know personally if you have a lot of free time.

The Tao is like a glob pattern:             It is masked but always present.
used but never used up.                     I don't know who built to it.
It is like the extern void:                 It came before the first kernel.
filled with infinite possibilities.         [<A HREF="mailto:glyph@twistedmatrix.com">glyph@twistedmatrix.com</A>]
