I hope to be returning to Divinal really soon. I apologize for my abscence
but the year has been trying. Noticing a similiar e-mail, I will give you my
contact information:

atuarre@gcaptain.com
shaard@gcaptain.com
glennc@gcaptain.com
glennc@ci-sp.net

Any of the above four e-mail addresses can be used to contact me. I don't
have a personal website, I used to, but with all the restructuring of CI and
new policies, I've had to remove it, for now. I hope to be back soon. Miss
you all

Realizing that AOL lets you have REDICULOUSLY long handles these days, I
have changed my AIM screen name to "Divunal Maxwell".

I know it's gratuitous, but it looks so much better :-)

The Tao is like a glob pattern:             It is masked but always present.
used but never used up.                     I don't know who built to it.
It is like the extern void:                 It came before the first kernel.
filled with infinite possibilities.         [glyph@twistedmatrix.com]

Actually, it looks like your first name is "Divunal" and your last is
"Maxwell", which looks kinda weird, but maybe it's just me.  :-)
