The current incarnation of the reality pump went online on Friday, October
22.  Since that time, it has recieved 188 logins, 46 of which were guest
users.

However, the server that it's running on has pretty solidly had an uptime
of 0.00, 0.00, 0.00.  There is essentially no load at all on the Divunal
server itself.

Could we arrange a time where we could all log in and pound on it for a
while, just to see what happens?  I'd like to know if there are any
load-related problems that we might expect to encounter.  I doubt it, but
it would be nice to know about them.

This is likely to be the case for many people, so how about tomorrow,
about 5:00 PM?  I don't need anybody to do anything special, just sign in
and poke around for a while.  I want to see if I can get a nonzero load on
Zaibach, so feel free to do relatively intense stuff (Mike, please figure
out just HOW nasty that 'discover' is going to be BEFORE you do it...)

	Hmm... If you have a new version of the client and everything, it
sounds like Hampshire's network is crapping out on you... I've left mine alone
for hours at a time and it still stays alive.

	I added a Divunal Verbs section to the Verb Index recently... It's not
nearly done yet, but I did explain how discover (presumably) works.

	And... While I'm emailing everyone on the project, I would like to
point out to all the aspiring authors looking to "get something done" in the
near future that I'm almost always available online, through AOLIM or Divunal,
and that I am supposed to be the Documentation and Help guy... It's my job to
help explain authoring (even basic authoring, which is, if nothing else, easier
for me to explain) and to write documentation, so please don't hesitate to ask
me to do one or both of these things if you need some help.

We also announced Inheritance for the first time -- knowledgeable twisted
reality developers would be very helpful there, if any of you guys have
time.

We should be doing releases far more frequently in the near future, so as
to keep a more 'active' presence on FM and (hopefully) other sites too.

	Hmm... If you have a new version of the client and everything, it
sounds like Hampshire's network is crapping out on you... I've left mine alone
for hours at a time and it still stays alive.

	I added a Divunal Verbs section to the Verb Index recently... It's not
nearly done yet, but I did explain how discover (presumably) works.

	And... While I'm emailing everyone on the project, I would like to
point out to all the aspiring authors looking to "get something done" in the
near future that I'm almost always available online, through AOLIM or Divunal,
and that I am supposed to be the Documentation and Help guy... It's my job to
help explain authoring (even basic authoring, which is, if nothing else, easier
for me to explain) and to write documentation, so please don't hesitate to ask
me to do one or both of these things if you need some help.

Thanks,

- Dave

Twisted Reality 1.2.0 has been released...

http://www.twistedmatrix.com/reality

We also announced Inheritance for the first time -- knowledgeable twisted
reality developers would be very helpful there, if any of you guys have
time.

http://www.twistedmatrix.com/reality/inheritance

We should be doing releases far more frequently in the near future, so as
to keep a more 'active' presence on FM and (hopefully) other sites too.
