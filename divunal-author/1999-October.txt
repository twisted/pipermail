Off the top of my head:

Perhaps a "Propogate events to" list in rooms, possibly allowing for
certain "wildcards" like the ones below and, ideally something like "all
other rooms in the forest".    

This sounds like it could get into the "separate maps" issue, and that
might be the most expedient way of dealing with it (and having "shards"
down the road).  It might be sufficient to have a) a property on rooms
to denote what area(s) they belong to (e.g. Maxwell's Castle, Tenth's
Mansion) or b) a vector for each area of "pointers" to included rooms. 
The former might fit better with the current setup, while the latter
would probably be faster to use.

In any PropEvent parent class would be handy for handling universal
propogation issues, being extended for individual things like weather,
sounds, time of day, etc.

Something I thought about a bit a while ago, that seems pertinet here:
should we change room's descriptions when the weather/time of day/etc
changes?  Certainly more realistic, but probably too panful to
implement.

Sorry I can't send code, but doing this requires much more time and
knowledge of the server than I have.

When I said "reality", I really meant it.  there actually is a list for
discussing twisted reality development.  The address is
'reality@twistedmatrix.com' ... predictably, the URL to subscribe yourself
is

http://www.twistedmatrix.com/mailman/listinfo/reality

Please do so if you're interested in developing the server

At least, this discussion should be on divunal-devel.  This is a technical
issue, and some authors might not be interested in hearing about it...
I've heard complaints more than once about technical issues being covered
on this list, and I have to remind some authors not to automatically
delete mailinglist mail on the grounds that it's "probably just technical
junk anyway".

Also, this is open-source, so let's try to keep our generic,
non-divunal-specific ones (like James's comments about music in the
client) on the other list.

Thank you.  (I will reply to this on reality@twistedmatrix.com too, for my
$0.02 on how it should be done)

Subject: [Divunal-author]TR & Divunal Demos

In an effort to help us all Actually Get Something Done(TM), Glyph and I
have been discussing our game plan and development schedule for Divunal
and TR.

More specifically, our interest in releasing a TR and/or Divunal demo
sometime in the near future. It's pretty accurate to say that our previous
attempt at a demo (The TR Demo center) was, to quote a certain South Park
character, "pretty f@#*!ng weak." Well, it wasn't _that_ bad, and the John
Romero action figure in the gift shop was sort of funny, but it never
really got finished, and the guests who tried it out weren't terribly
impressed, aside from the novelty of trying out an Open Source gaming
project demo that actually uncompressed, ran, and did something other
than dumping core. ;-)

While sort of interesting, the Demo Center wasn't a fantastic
demonstration of what the TR engine can do. And it certainly didn't tell
you jack (nor shit) about Divunal. We've come up with somewhat of a plan,
which should be especially interesting to those of you who have been
asking for something "Meaningful" to do:

1.  Fix the TR Demo:

     This isn't a terribly high priority, as it will be replaced by the
Divunal Demo soon (see #3 below) but if you want to practice making rooms
or puzzles where real live players can interact with them, it can be a
cool place to experiment. For those of you who haven't already heard about
this, if you log in as "guest" with password "guest", you get a temporary
random character and start in the Demo Area, where there are a few rooms
to explore and objects to play with. You get points for solving
puzzles/using objects correctly, but the points currently don't ever quite
get you anything. If you'd like to add onto or finish this area, it would
be good practice. Keep in mind that guests may show up at any time (we
still get a few each day) and that they have a strange habit of trying to
walk off with anything that isn't nailed down, and attempt to damage or
destroy the game world through any means possible, so watch out.  ;-)
This is already %75 complete (by my original plan, anyway) so I'll put up
some general "TR Demo Area Authoring Docs" tonight for anyone who's
curious as to how it currently works.

2. Make a standalone TR Demo, and Release the Source.

     In some ways, this makes for a better engine demo; You can play it on
your own machine, and take it apart to see how it works. This is not
related to Divunal in any way, so we decided to make it a totally
different genre. You may have noticed the "inheritance" directory in the
CVS tree (or you will after we update CVS again); This is where the code
for the demo will be going. It's essentially an adaptation of the small
group module I ran at the last Ravenloft game at Hampshire. It's sort of
an homage to the late H.P. Lovecraft, so, like %65 of his short stories,
it opens with you, the main character, inheriting a strange old house from
your uncle, and driving out to Middle of Nowhere circa mid-1920's Western
Massachusetts to check it out. It is intended mostly as a single player
game, since it runs as a standalone package, but I'm making sure that all
of the verbs give multiplayer-style tellAll feedback so that the people
who read the code get a better idea of how it works. (or in case anyone
tries to make a cooperative mode for it, or something.) It's basically
meant to be a really fancy single player game, easily downloaded and
played on the user's own computer, and to show off as many of the cool
features of our engine as possible. This is already in progress, although
it hasn't gotten too far... EMail or IM me for more information.

3. Make a Divunal Demo.

     This would come after steps 1 and 2... We would essentially be taking
a large portion of what we currently have in the Divunal map, and
trimming, editing, and adding to it to make a good representation of what
playing Divunal would be like. This will most likely be running on our
server and support multiple guest players, like the TR demo, and we will
NOT be releasing the specific code for it, being as it is Divunal-specific
stuff. We were thinking about having the demo contain part of the ruined
city outside the library, and some selected parts of the inside of 
library, so that a player who went from playing the demo to playing the
full game would mostly just see the world get a lot bigger (and more
populated). The planning for this is still sort of up the air, as you may
have noticed from my description, but if you'd like your part of the
library to be included in the demo (or if you would like to make part of
the city, etc.) for it, this is a good time to start planning. We also
need to get the character generator and a few other things working, too,
so this probably won't be for a month or two at the earliest. 


Right. EMail or IM me if you have any questions, or post
ideas/comments/general interest questions to the list... Thank you, and I
hope this list helps to give us all something to do. (It sure gave me a
hell of a lot to do, but, then, I have no life outside of my job, so it's
a nice change.  ;-)

When I said "reality", I really meant it.  there actually is a list for
discussing twisted reality development.  The address is
'reality@twistedmatrix.com' ... predictably, the URL to subscribe yourself
is

http://www.twistedmatrix.com/mailman/listinfo/reality

Please do so if you're interested in developing the server

At least, this discussion should be on divunal-devel.  This is a technical
issue, and some authors might not be interested in hearing about it...
I've heard complaints more than once about technical issues being covered
on this list, and I have to remind some authors not to automatically
delete mailinglist mail on the grounds that it's "probably just technical
junk anyway".

Also, this is open-source, so let's try to keep our generic,
non-divunal-specific ones (like James's comments about music in the
client) on the other list.

Thank you.  (I will reply to this on reality@twistedmatrix.com too, for my
$0.02 on how it should be done)

I've started the "Player's Index" pages (basically, I'm posting the
responses to the form I put up a few weeks ago.) Please peruse the pages
and let me know what you think. These are simply the proofs, I still have
some work to do, so I f you have suggestions, now is the time!
 
I think there may have been some problems with the form mailer i used;
several of the responses seem truncated or perhaps those fields were only
partially filled out. Either way, please give your answers closure. Email
me corrections and updates privately.

(each player has his/her own page, so you can go directly to you
character page but substituting his/her name into the abover URL - they
are all linked together)

ps. if you don't like the font i used for your name, let me know and
specify the font you do want and, at some point when I'm feeling
particularly charitable, I'll fix it... maybe ;-).  

pps
if you haven't filled out the form yet.. please do -

If you have a picture you'd like to have on your index page, please send
it to me. I'm not necessarily thinking photographs; perhaps more along 
the lines of an image related to your character(Poser people, perhaps?)
or some other graphic that has particular Divunal significance.
I'm using a watercolour by Nick Bantock that inspired my description of
Agatha. (yes, Nick Bantock of Griffin_and_Sabine fame)

ok, back to work

That sounds like a really cool idea. Anyone have any idea where I could
use a copy of Poser? Better still, anyone know of any free Poser clones
for windows or linux? (can Blender do that yet? )

Subject: [Divunal-author]TR & Divunal Demos

In an effort to help us all Actually Get Something Done(TM), Glyph and I
have been discussing our game plan and development schedule for Divunal
and TR.

More specifically, our interest in releasing a TR and/or Divunal demo
sometime in the near future. It's pretty accurate to say that our previous
attempt at a demo (The TR Demo center) was, to quote a certain South Park
character, "pretty f@#*!ng weak." Well, it wasn't _that_ bad, and the John
Romero action figure in the gift shop was sort of funny, but it never
really got finished, and the guests who tried it out weren't terribly
impressed, aside from the novelty of trying out an Open Source gaming
project demo that actually uncompressed, ran, and did something other
than dumping core. ;-)

While sort of interesting, the Demo Center wasn't a fantastic
demonstration of what the TR engine can do. And it certainly didn't tell
you jack (nor shit) about Divunal. We've come up with somewhat of a plan,
which should be especially interesting to those of you who have been
asking for something "Meaningful" to do:

1.  Fix the TR Demo:

     This isn't a terribly high priority, as it will be replaced by the
Divunal Demo soon (see #3 below) but if you want to practice making rooms
or puzzles where real live players can interact with them, it can be a
cool place to experiment. For those of you who haven't already heard about
this, if you log in as "guest" with password "guest", you get a temporary
random character and start in the Demo Area, where there are a few rooms
to explore and objects to play with. You get points for solving
puzzles/using objects correctly, but the points currently don't ever quite
get you anything. If you'd like to add onto or finish this area, it would
be good practice. Keep in mind that guests may show up at any time (we
still get a few each day) and that they have a strange habit of trying to
walk off with anything that isn't nailed down, and attempt to damage or
destroy the game world through any means possible, so watch out.  ;-)
This is already %75 complete (by my original plan, anyway) so I'll put up
some general "TR Demo Area Authoring Docs" tonight for anyone who's
curious as to how it currently works.

2. Make a standalone TR Demo, and Release the Source.

     In some ways, this makes for a better engine demo; You can play it on
your own machine, and take it apart to see how it works. This is not
related to Divunal in any way, so we decided to make it a totally
different genre. You may have noticed the "inheritance" directory in the
CVS tree (or you will after we update CVS again); This is where the code
for the demo will be going. It's essentially an adaptation of the small
group module I ran at the last Ravenloft game at Hampshire. It's sort of
an homage to the late H.P. Lovecraft, so, like %65 of his short stories,
it opens with you, the main character, inheriting a strange old house from
your uncle, and driving out to Middle of Nowhere circa mid-1920's Western
Massachusetts to check it out. It is intended mostly as a single player
game, since it runs as a standalone package, but I'm making sure that all
of the verbs give multiplayer-style tellAll feedback so that the people
who read the code get a better idea of how it works. (or in case anyone
tries to make a cooperative mode for it, or something.) It's basically
meant to be a really fancy single player game, easily downloaded and
played on the user's own computer, and to show off as many of the cool
features of our engine as possible. This is already in progress, although
it hasn't gotten too far... EMail or IM me for more information.

3. Make a Divunal Demo.

     This would come after steps 1 and 2... We would essentially be taking
a large portion of what we currently have in the Divunal map, and
trimming, editing, and adding to it to make a good representation of what
playing Divunal would be like. This will most likely be running on our
server and support multiple guest players, like the TR demo, and we will
NOT be releasing the specific code for it, being as it is Divunal-specific
stuff. We were thinking about having the demo contain part of the ruined
city outside the library, and some selected parts of the inside of 
library, so that a player who went from playing the demo to playing the
full game would mostly just see the world get a lot bigger (and more
populated). The planning for this is still sort of up the air, as you may
have noticed from my description, but if you'd like your part of the
library to be included in the demo (or if you would like to make part of
the city, etc.) for it, this is a good time to start planning. We also
need to get the character generator and a few other things working, too,
so this probably won't be for a month or two at the earliest. 


Right. EMail or IM me if you have any questions, or post
ideas/comments/general interest questions to the list... Thank you, and I
hope this list helps to give us all something to do. (It sure gave me a
hell of a lot to do, but, then, I have no life outside of my job, so it's
a nice change.  ;-)

ooh! ooh! i have a question!

if it's your birthday and you get on a plane and cross the international
date line so that it's the day before, then wait a day, do you age two
years instead of one, and do you still get your presents?
