That doesn't include the recipients of the Author list, however,  :-)  so

I was trying to get the Faucet working on my MacOS X iMac today, and it's
completely broken!!

Would anyone else who has a copy of the faucet please check to see if I'm
on crack here?

First of all, it won't run classes which aren't in the root package.
Second, it's only JDK 1.1.6.  Third, their implementation of Swing is
broken (doesn't support javax.* naming convention).  Fourth (and this one
is my favorite) their AWT implementation is fucked enough that we can't
use Sun's swingall.jar!!

What's up with this?

If you'd downloaded a recent copy of the faucet (which I recommend
everyond do every once in a while now -- there are bugfixes coming left
and right) you'll notice the 'hostname' field is 'reality.divunal.com'.

Helix's name is still gonna be Helix.  However, we're going hog-wild with
the extra domain names, so currently helix is aliased to
reality.divunal.com, but in the future, a newer box will have that same
alias, and there will soon be a cvs.divunal.com, cvs.twistedmatrix.com
(YES we registered it!!! woohoo!!!).  For now, point your cvs clients at
helix...

ALSO, although all your stuff is still there if you had an account on
helix, I removed all the accounts and all the old mail (reinstall of RH,
6.0 now... pretty smooth, but we lost all the usual stuff) and I don't
want to re-add everybody.  Please send me personal email with the subject
"helix-administration" and I'll get it sorted out as soon as I can.

I was pretty sure I sent messages to the list about it... but the thing
is, in order to get onto the authoring page you have to have an account in
the game, and that's all being personally managed right now.

If you'd downloaded a recent copy of the faucet (which I recommend
everyond do every once in a while now -- there are bugfixes coming left
and right) you'll notice the 'hostname' field is 'reality.divunal.com'.

Helix's name is still gonna be Helix.  However, we're going hog-wild with
the extra domain names, so currently helix is aliased to
reality.divunal.com, but in the future, a newer box will have that same
alias, and there will soon be a cvs.divunal.com, cvs.twistedmatrix.com
(YES we registered it!!! woohoo!!!).  For now, point your cvs clients at
helix...

ALSO, although all your stuff is still there if you had an account on
helix, I removed all the accounts and all the old mail (reinstall of RH,
6.0 now... pretty smooth, but we lost all the usual stuff) and I don't
want to re-add everybody.  Please send me personal email with the subject
"helix-administration" and I'll get it sorted out as soon as I can.

I was pretty sure I sent messages to the list about it... but the thing
is, in order to get onto the authoring page you have to have an account in
the game, and that's all being personally managed right now.

Hi,

Could you tell me what sort of commitment (time-wise, etc.) you're expecting
from your authors and any requirements?

Thanks,
Gordon

Subject: [Divunal-author]More Author Information

I just wanted to welcome our new authors to the list, and also let
everyone know (especially the newer authors who haven't spent several
hours talking to us about this project in person) that I'm in the process
of putting more authoring guidelines up on the page... Most of it won't be
available until Thursday or Friday, but I just fixed the "What is Divunal,
Anyway?" page, which now includes a nice, readable summary of the Divunal
project, the plot, and the experience we intend to provide to the average 
player. We didn't have one of those before, and I hope it will help to
clear up some of the confusion our lack of good documentation has caused.

Thanks,

- Tenth
