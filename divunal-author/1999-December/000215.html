	Hmm... If you have a new version of the client and everything, it
sounds like Hampshire's network is crapping out on you... I've left mine alone
for hours at a time and it still stays alive.

</I>
	I added a Divunal Verbs section to the Verb Index recently... It's not
nearly done yet, but I did explain how discover (presumably) works.

	And... While I'm emailing everyone on the project, I would like to
point out to all the aspiring authors looking to &quot;get something done&quot; in the
near future that I'm almost always available online, through AOLIM or Divunal,
and that I am supposed to be the Documentation and Help guy... It's my job to
help explain authoring (even basic authoring, which is, if nothing else, easier
for me to explain) and to write documentation, so please don't hesitate to ask
me to do one or both of these things if you need some help.

Thanks,

- Dave
