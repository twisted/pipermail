<PRE>Twisted Reality 1.2.0 has been released...

<A HREF="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/reality">http://www.twistedmatrix.com/reality</A>

We also announced Inheritance for the first time -- knowledgeable twisted
reality developers would be very helpful there, if any of you guys have
time.

<A HREF="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/reality/inheritance">http://www.twistedmatrix.com/reality/inheritance</A>

We should be doing releases far more frequently in the near future, so as
to keep a more 'active' presence on FM and (hopefully) other sites too.

The Tao is like a glob pattern:             It is masked but always present.
used but never used up.                     I don't know who built to it.
It is like the extern void:                 It came before the first kernel.
filled with infinite possibilities.         [<A HREF="mailto:glyph@twistedmatrix.com">glyph@twistedmatrix.com</A>]
