I really enjoyed this short introduction. It's kind of like
sci-fi/mystery, from what I gather, based on the &quot;solve the problem&quot; 
style. Very IF-ish, anyway :)

So I strongly encourage you to continue it. It would be cool to develop
stories like this in parallel with the game world, although I wonder if
it would interfere with the zero-story philosophy of the game. From what
I can gather of your past descriptions of the idea, it was that the
story developed in the game, and this is story developed outside of the
game. I like it, and I doubt it's a bad thing, so I'm just playing
devil's advocate in order to refine the philosophy in my head :)
