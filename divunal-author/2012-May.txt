Subject: [Divunal-author] HomeMatic - xmlrpc twisted !!
Message-ID: <CAEUxhZ2Ps8H=DALLMuKgtE=TwBi8bhh0yPp6QRu_YG1yG5+e_A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

     I'm trying to connect to homematic server at address '192.168.1.251'
and port '2001'. I have a sample twisted server and client on my localhost.
It's working fine. Now to the functions in server protocol.py file, I added
another function  (as shown below) which creates another client that
connects to homematic server. But it's giving following error when I start
the client.
Error:
       File "/home/vinodh/Desktop/homematic/xmlrpc_twisted/protocol.py",
line 45, in xmlrpc_init
       d = ClientCreator(reactor).connectTCP(self,'192.168.1.251',2001)
       exceptions.TypeError: __init__() takes at least 3 arguments (2
given)"

my scenario is this way:
mycleint ---> myserver(protocol file--->cliet-->homematic server)

Please help me out.

Thanks,
Vinod

This list is about a video game (whose development is pretty well defunct) - how did you even find it? :)
