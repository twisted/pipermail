You may have noticed that activity on Divunal has been rather slow lately.
We here at TME are trying to organize our schedules to fit more Vitamin D.
into our daily diet, but I'm curious as to why the project as a whole has
suffered such dramatic brain-drain.

Things seem to be perking back up, but I'd like to hear from some, if not
all of you, what you think the problems with the way that Divunal is set
up?  Is this a fantastically coincidental problem with individual
schedules, or an issue with the way the project is being run?

I don't want to be a bother, but if those of you on this list aren't
really interested in helping out by doing web-design, making areas,
writing code... please just let me know.  If I've screwed up somehow, and
you *can't* contribute for some reason, I'd like to hear that too.

I want to know if it's a waste of time to be maintaining the authoring
website going forward, or if Dave and I should just throw our backs into
just writing the game, maintaining our "bible" scribbled on the backs of
napkins and such.

Also, if there's something crucial that you've all been waiting for, it
would be good to know what it is, so we can really make the best of what
resources we have.

Thanks for listening.  We now return you to your regularly scheduled SPAM.

(This is long; please bear with me.)

Glyph--

	While the slowdown is certainly a result of scheduling and other
issues on my part, I think there are several things about Divunal and the
way it's managed that need to be improved.  I'll discuss my problems and
then suggest solutions, so bear with me.  The changes I see being needed
fall into two basic categories: project organization/management and game
design.

	We need to be more independent of you and Dave (Y&D).  At this
point, that's really tough to do, mainly because there isn't much in the
way of documentation about the world, features available, or how to get at
those nifty features.  It's really not feasable to do much creation or
coding without having an AIM or IRC session open to Y&D because of this,
and that's not the best use of anyone's time.  Also, there's evidently a
bunch of stuff that's been decided/developed that no one outside of Y&D
know about, e.g. the magic system.  I've had many a discussion with you
where I've been told that something--history, area, feature, etc.--has
already been dealt with; none of us outside of DCIT knew about it, though.
(Or I wouldn't have asked.)  At the risk of sounding caustic (which I
don't mean to be), it often seems that Ridgefield is like a secret lab or
monestary, which occassionally feeds those of us outside the fold a little
morsel of knowledge to keep us feeling like we're involved.
	In your email, you ask us to let you know if we're not interested
in doing stuff.  My question is: what stuff needs to be done?  There's no
list anywhere, and I know that I've come up with ideas for things only to
have them rebuffed as unecessary, not crucial, or already done.  Again, we
shouldn't have go to Y&D for this: there should be a list of things to do
posted on the web site, covering at least programming, web stuff, docs,
and writing/design.  I want to make a note about the last of these.  I've
been explicitly told that we really don't need people who can't code.  I
think that's wrong--I'd rather have one good writer than two great
programmers: we have (most of) the tech we need; now we need puzzles, a
world, and a plot.

	This brings me to what's become my biggest concern: what is this
game about?  We still haven't answered this question.  Yes, we've got "an
immersive, text-based environment", but that doesn't say much about the
game itself.  It's like only telling someone that Baldur's Gate is a CRPG,
or that Zork is a puzzle-solving game.  We've talked about it being
puzzle-centric, but we haven't any real reason for people to solve
puzzles, and without one, we're fundamentally the same as a MUD.  There,
people kill stuff for the sake of killing stuff; in Divunal, they solve
puzzles for the sake of solving puzzles.  
	The amnesia thing is an interesting idea, but it's still
insufficient, at least in the long term.  Why should I want to find out
about my past?  Why is it important to me?  If there's no effect on myself
or the world once I figure out who I was (or while I'm figuring it out),
then there's little motivation to do it, and it becomes little more than a
gimmick.
	Figuring out the plot--the central idea of the game--is *hard*,
but it's at the heart of any RPG.  Our job is especially difficult b/c of
the multiplayer element.  Still, we need to give the players distinct
goals to pursue, and reasons to pursue them, or we're going to end up with
a bunch of puzzle-solving machines and waste the richness of the world.  I
should note that a lack of long-term, complex goals is exactly what kills
the role-playing in MUDs, and it'll do the same to us if we're not
careful.  On the flip side, if we can come up with something good, we will
*rock*.
	What I said above applies to this, too.  While plot, world, etc.
elements can be developed in an ivory tower, everyone else should know
about them ASAP.  In fact, the initial development is probably better done
by a small group: devising ideas in a committee is basically impossible.
Still, when something's developed, it should be posted quickly so people
can use and/or critique it.

	Finally, you need to trust us.  I've also had several
conversations where we've talked about things, esp. stuff outside the
library, and I've basically been told, "Dave and I are doing everything
outside of the library.  The rest of you can stay in your sandbox and play
where you won't hurt anyone."  I understand that there's a certain amount
of learning that needs to happen, but comments like that, the fact that
there's almost no documentation (making it hard to learn), and us having
to filter all of our web site stuff through you (stuff which doesn't
always get looked at),  make me feel like you want to keep a very tight
rein on us, that you have to be in control of every little detail.  Think
of it like being a parent: how will you ever trust us unless you give us a
chance to prove ourselves?  (Esp. when we haven't done anything to make
you think otherwise, AFAIK.  Is this residue from previous projects?)

	Those are my biggest problems; perhaps I should have mentioned
them sooner, but I have to admit that I was worried they wouldn't be
considered b/c I haven't done a huge amount of work on the game yet.  In
any event, I'm certainly not one to gripe about something without trying
to devise some solutions, so here are some "action items" that Y&D and the
rest of us can do:

	- *This is the most important* Y&D, as the guys in the know,
should shift your focus away from adding new things and put your energy
into documenting what already exists.  This will allow the rest of us to
work independently and faster in a shorter amount of time.  The
documentation should include at least: what the design parameters are
(i.e. what guidelines exist for creating new areas and adding to existing
ones, e.g. what do I have to keep in mind if I want to add to the
underground city?), what features we have available and how they work
(e.g. extending, those popup windows), and the history, society, etc. of
Divunal.
	- Everyone: when you learn something, either through talking to
G&D or by figuring it out on your own, document it, even if it's small.
Less work for everyone that way.
	- Figure out a plot--what the characters should be trying to
achieve
	- Post a wish list
	- Update the documentation and post to the list as soon as
something new is decided on or developed

	Basically, I don't think we're *ready* to be working hardcore on
Divunal.  There's a lot of foundational work that needs to be done before
we're going to be in a position to make a good story and a good game.

Subject: [Divunal-author]author efficiency (my two cents)

On one hand, I certainly agree with what Michael has said. Primarily,
the documentation that is available at this point is pretty sparse.
However, we do have to recognize that divunal is not yet a commercial
enterprise, and having to juggle other jobs makes finding time to work
on divunal pretty hard. In that same vein I have to applaud those,
namely, Glyph, who are willing to pull all-nighters in order to
coordinate day jobs with game development.

Also, we do need some sort of plan about where exactly divunal is
going, and what the ultimate goal of the game is (if that's possible,
if not, as close as we can come).

I also concur that one of the number one things we need along with
better documentation is a real TODO list. Something heavy-duty
(allowing people to "sign up" for jobs, mark tasks as completed) and
web-based is required. I'd like to volunteer to work on a cgi script
for such a list.

As far as Michael's point about rather having one good writer than two
programmers, I have to disagree. Since the key to divunal is supposed
to be the puzzles, what is necessary is programmers who are also good
writers, a rare breed. Few interesting puzzles can be created at this
time without some sort of coding.

Finally, as far as the current state of the game, i'm afraid that at
this current rate of speed, it's going to be awhile before we have
something that's comparable to the other MUDs/games/whatever that are
currently available. For example, take a look at Avalon
(www.avalon-rpg.com). True, it's direction is a bit different than
ours, but it is really mind-blowing. That's something I would pay for
(if i were into paying for things, which i'm not ;-))....

Still, I have to close this with one thought. Twisted Reality is cool.
I've been trying to write a game framework like this for years, and
some of the features we may take for granted code-wise I never even
thought of when I was developing. Divunal can be incredible...we just
need to work at it.

Subject: [Divunal-author]author efficiency (my two cents)

A few notes:

First of all, I commend Glyph, Dave, and James for putting so much hard
work into TR and Divunal.  It's great to have such a dedicated core of
developers.  I erred in not mentioning this in my letter; it would have
lessened the causticity a bit.  What I was taking issue with was that the
dedicated core needs to be more open with its developments so that the
rest of us can have an easier time creating things, which will distribute,
and thus ease, the load on everyone.

And, even though I come from a Mac background and bitch about poor
interfaces and documentation all the time, I understand how difficult it
is to motivate oneself to write it, even if it's just a couple of
paragraphs.  It feels like you're having to do the development all over
again, just in a different language.

I didn't mean to say that all of this would be easy, just that it's
necessary.  

On to a few specific points:

> I also concur that one of the number one things we need along with

> (allowing people to "sign up" for jobs, mark tasks as completed) and

	And I'll try to get ProjectMaster (a piece of project management
software I've done some design on) started ASAP...though that'll probably
be when school starts.  ::growls about incomplete work::

	Sure, ideally we'd have people who are talented in both areas.
However, it's likely that we'll have people whose strengths are weighted
one way or another, and it's probably going to be easier in most cases to
code a puzzle than it will be to design it.  In any event, I think we
should be open to having people who are "only" writers/designers on board,
and just let them know that they won't necessarily have people at their
beck and call.  It'd be cool, though, to have one or more people designing
things and posting their designs, letting coders grab them as they can.
Less down time that way.

	I can't really comment on the Avalon thing, since I haven't had
the time to look over their site, but I should probably mention that my
conception of Divunal is something more along the lines of a pen-and-paper
RPG, only a bit more autonomous.  (In that the computer takes care of all
the "rolling" and such.)  What killed my addiction to MUDs was the utter
lack of a goal with depth--killing for the sake of killing.  As I
mentioned in my other letter, I don't want us to fall into the same trap
with puzzles.

	On that note, I think we should add something to the TODO list: a
mission statement.  It'll be a lot easier to design things, including the
plot and the world, when we know what effect we're trying to achieve.


	Work's over.  Gotta go.

Thank you for the praise.  In kind, I would like to thank you for several 
of these:

TR/CVS 0.1 COMMIT MESSAGE. Guyute IS RESPONSIBLE.

In terms of getting anything productive done, though :-), I'd like to
address the first part of that paragraph:

"the documentation that is available at this point is pretty sparse."

Not that I disagree, but I'd be *very* interested ot hear which pieces of
the documentation need revision and addition.  If I got a message every
single day on this mailinglist asking for a clarification on some part of
the Divunal societal structure or the code infrastructure, I couldn't be
happier -- as long as it was a specific, targeted question which I could
answer with something other than a long, laborious process of writing
down EVERYTHING I know about Divunal in the hopes that that was what
everyone wanted to know.

> Also, we do need some sort of plan about where exactly divunal is

I don't understand what's so unclear about where it's going, either... the
basic idea is to construct a world that's a lot of fun to interact with
other people and solve puzzles in.  Like many worlds, there is no ultimate
goal to the world.  While there are many themes, the central one is fairly
philosophical, and still evolving (although in a few weeks, I should be
able to write a concise essay describing it), and there is no "point" to
it all.  It's just some stuff.  There should also be no "main" plot. There
are a few which are more important than others, but if it turns out that
nobody gives a damn about Maxwell's angst, and they're all concerned with
the state of the underground city and Tsiale's mysterious past, well,
then, we concentrate more on developing the areas where there's interest
than where there isn't.

Agreed.  Although Mike's ProjectMaster CGI sounds interesting, it sounds
like it might be much more comprehensive than what we need (especially to
start) and I wouldn't mind pulling another all-nighter to complete
something.

Before *anybody* does something drastic like that though, does anyone
listening to this list know whether or not the Mozilla

And as I said in response to Mike's email, you're both wrong :-)
Writer/programmers are nice (Dave and I are able to run the project
because we can do both) but we need to foster cooperation between writers
and programmers.  A TODO list would greatly facilitate this.

Please consider the first item on that list (until we have an official
TODO website) to be: write a home for your archetype, if you have one, and
find someone who has one to bother and help with the construction of their
home.

Aye.  There's the rub.

I'm not satisfied with this rate of progress, and I'm not willing to
merely acknowledge it as the rate at which we will continue working. Since
some of the slowdown has been my fault directly (despite my few dramatic
all-nighters, I haven't been working on this as much as I should be) I am
going to pick up my slack, and I'd like to see other authors do the same,
hence my email :-)

Thanks much! :-)

Although I've been driving it to completion lo these many years, TR has
always benefited greatly from the spare time of bored friends of mine.
Thanks everyone who's contributed code, docs, or even graphics for a
website.

One day, soon, I'll put together a credits file.

o=other in the field names.

Escape codes for use in social strings:

Subject: [Divunal-author]Doors

I've improved the way doors work to allow for greater realism.  Now,
opening and closing a door not only blocks the exit, they inform people
that the door was opened/closed, are compliant with TR's perspectives,
and--perhaps most importantly--it dynamically alters the descriptions of
the rooms the door connects, adding and removing strings to reflect the
door's change of state.  This is to eliminate rooms that had descriptions
along the lines of, "To a steel doorway to the south, you see a row of
bookcases", even when the southern door was closed.  

*Please make use of this.*  Convert your old doors as well.  It'll mean a
little extra work, but it will be well worth it.

On a related note, there is now a "locked" boolean property on doors to
indicate whether or not they're locked.  (Big surprise.)  I will be adding
more w/regard to this and keys shortly.

This also involved the creation of the divunal.door.Door utility class,
which currently has two each of open() and close() methods, for greater
customizability; locks and associated stuff will be in there soon.
divunal.door.Open and .Close (the files for the associated verbs) make use
of the new class.

Documentation is at http://www.twistedmatrix.com/authors/doors.html.
Email me with questions, comments, etc., but please read the docs first.

Subject: [Divunal-author]Re: [Divunal-devel] release criterea

Well, you covered a lot of what I would say, so this is going to reiterate
things a bit.

I think that we should start by getting a big wishlist--a brain dump of
features, fixes, etc.--from everyone.  This should include specific
technical stuff (e.g. "Add a StringHandler class") as well as general
ideas, (e.g. "figure out what to do with amounts of items, like water and
gold").  Personally, I think docs should be on this list, too.  I'd hope
that people would be comfortable speaking their minds on this, even if
they haven't done a lot of development.  (They may still have ideas for
what would be nifty to have in a game.  This is why I CC'd the author
list; though everyone may be on both at this point....)

The list could then be culled for stuff that's already in and things that
are bad design ideas.  (This could also be handy for a reference on what
needs to be documented and/or what people need to be informed of.  If lots
are clamoring for a feature that's already in there, it's time for some
communication.)

What remains should then be prioritized, putting those "API-breaking
changes" and related stuff at the top of the list.  Then, break the list
into bite-sized pieces and make those releases.

Of course, people can (and should) continue developing stuff that they
really want to develop, but this would at least give some direction to
development and releases and might help out anyone who's been wondering
what's needed on the server side.  Also, I'm sure the pieces would be
adaptable to stuff like unforseen problems and the like.

This doesn't really answer the versioning number question, but I think
that's secondary to establishing what's going into the releases.  Also,
since TR 1.0 is going to be so fanstastically better compared to what's
out there now--much of which is in much later version numbers--I have
trouble saying what the gradations should be.  (I'm also more familiar
with the principle of incremental development than the mystical nature of
the version number, too.)

That's my $0.02

When you make an object, please remember to give it a reasonable list of
synonyms.  *Especially* if the object has a string property for its name!  

"A yellow paperback book is here"
$ take yellow paperback book
"There is no yellow paperback book here."

That's rather counterintuitive...

Is there a reason why, when the search routine is going through a verbs
list of synonyms, it couldn't also check the "name" string of the
object?

You may have noticed that activity on Divunal has been rather slow lately.
We here at TME are trying to organize our schedules to fit more Vitamin D.
into our daily diet, but I'm curious as to why the project as a whole has
suffered such dramatic brain-drain.

Things seem to be perking back up, but I'd like to hear from some, if not
all of you, what you think the problems with the way that Divunal is set
up?  Is this a fantastically coincidental problem with individual
schedules, or an issue with the way the project is being run?

I don't want to be a bother, but if those of you on this list aren't
really interested in helping out by doing web-design, making areas,
writing code... please just let me know.  If I've screwed up somehow, and
you *can't* contribute for some reason, I'd like to hear that too.

I want to know if it's a waste of time to be maintaining the authoring
website going forward, or if Dave and I should just throw our backs into
just writing the game, maintaining our "bible" scribbled on the backs of
napkins and such.

Also, if there's something crucial that you've all been waiting for, it
would be good to know what it is, so we can really make the best of what
resources we have.

Thanks for listening.  We now return you to your regularly scheduled SPAM.

Subject: [Divunal-author]author efficiency

(This is long; please bear with me.)

Glyph--

	While the slowdown is certainly a result of scheduling and other
issues on my part, I think there are several things about Divunal and the
way it's managed that need to be improved.  I'll discuss my problems and
then suggest solutions, so bear with me.  The changes I see being needed
fall into two basic categories: project organization/management and game
design.

	We need to be more independent of you and Dave (Y&D).  At this
point, that's really tough to do, mainly because there isn't much in the
way of documentation about the world, features available, or how to get at
those nifty features.  It's really not feasable to do much creation or
coding without having an AIM or IRC session open to Y&D because of this,
and that's not the best use of anyone's time.  Also, there's evidently a
bunch of stuff that's been decided/developed that no one outside of Y&D
know about, e.g. the magic system.  I've had many a discussion with you
where I've been told that something--history, area, feature, etc.--has
already been dealt with; none of us outside of DCIT knew about it, though.
(Or I wouldn't have asked.)  At the risk of sounding caustic (which I
don't mean to be), it often seems that Ridgefield is like a secret lab or
monestary, which occassionally feeds those of us outside the fold a little
morsel of knowledge to keep us feeling like we're involved.
	In your email, you ask us to let you know if we're not interested
in doing stuff.  My question is: what stuff needs to be done?  There's no
list anywhere, and I know that I've come up with ideas for things only to
have them rebuffed as unecessary, not crucial, or already done.  Again, we
shouldn't have go to Y&D for this: there should be a list of things to do
posted on the web site, covering at least programming, web stuff, docs,
and writing/design.  I want to make a note about the last of these.  I've
been explicitly told that we really don't need people who can't code.  I
think that's wrong--I'd rather have one good writer than two great
programmers: we have (most of) the tech we need; now we need puzzles, a
world, and a plot.

	This brings me to what's become my biggest concern: what is this
game about?  We still haven't answered this question.  Yes, we've got "an
immersive, text-based environment", but that doesn't say much about the
game itself.  It's like only telling someone that Baldur's Gate is a CRPG,
or that Zork is a puzzle-solving game.  We've talked about it being
puzzle-centric, but we haven't any real reason for people to solve
puzzles, and without one, we're fundamentally the same as a MUD.  There,
people kill stuff for the sake of killing stuff; in Divunal, they solve
puzzles for the sake of solving puzzles.  
	The amnesia thing is an interesting idea, but it's still
insufficient, at least in the long term.  Why should I want to find out
about my past?  Why is it important to me?  If there's no effect on myself
or the world once I figure out who I was (or while I'm figuring it out),
then there's little motivation to do it, and it becomes little more than a
gimmick.
	Figuring out the plot--the central idea of the game--is *hard*,
but it's at the heart of any RPG.  Our job is especially difficult b/c of
the multiplayer element.  Still, we need to give the players distinct
goals to pursue, and reasons to pursue them, or we're going to end up with
a bunch of puzzle-solving machines and waste the richness of the world.  I
should note that a lack of long-term, complex goals is exactly what kills
the role-playing in MUDs, and it'll do the same to us if we're not
careful.  On the flip side, if we can come up with something good, we will
*rock*.
	What I said above applies to this, too.  While plot, world, etc.
elements can be developed in an ivory tower, everyone else should know
about them ASAP.  In fact, the initial development is probably better done
by a small group: devising ideas in a committee is basically impossible.
Still, when something's developed, it should be posted quickly so people
can use and/or critique it.

	Finally, you need to trust us.  I've also had several
conversations where we've talked about things, esp. stuff outside the
library, and I've basically been told, "Dave and I are doing everything
outside of the library.  The rest of you can stay in your sandbox and play
where you won't hurt anyone."  I understand that there's a certain amount
of learning that needs to happen, but comments like that, the fact that
there's almost no documentation (making it hard to learn), and us having
to filter all of our web site stuff through you (stuff which doesn't
always get looked at),  make me feel like you want to keep a very tight
rein on us, that you have to be in control of every little detail.  Think
of it like being a parent: how will you ever trust us unless you give us a
chance to prove ourselves?  (Esp. when we haven't done anything to make
you think otherwise, AFAIK.  Is this residue from previous projects?)

	Those are my biggest problems; perhaps I should have mentioned
them sooner, but I have to admit that I was worried they wouldn't be
considered b/c I haven't done a huge amount of work on the game yet.  In
any event, I'm certainly not one to gripe about something without trying
to devise some solutions, so here are some "action items" that Y&D and the
rest of us can do:

	- *This is the most important* Y&D, as the guys in the know,
should shift your focus away from adding new things and put your energy
into documenting what already exists.  This will allow the rest of us to
work independently and faster in a shorter amount of time.  The
documentation should include at least: what the design parameters are
(i.e. what guidelines exist for creating new areas and adding to existing
ones, e.g. what do I have to keep in mind if I want to add to the
underground city?), what features we have available and how they work
(e.g. extending, those popup windows), and the history, society, etc. of
Divunal.
	- Everyone: when you learn something, either through talking to
G&D or by figuring it out on your own, document it, even if it's small.
Less work for everyone that way.
	- Figure out a plot--what the characters should be trying to
achieve
	- Post a wish list
	- Update the documentation and post to the list as soon as
something new is decided on or developed

	Basically, I don't think we're *ready* to be working hardcore on
Divunal.  There's a lot of foundational work that needs to be done before
we're going to be in a position to make a good story and a good game.

Subject: [Divunal-author]author efficiency (my two cents)

On one hand, I certainly agree with what Michael has said. Primarily,
the documentation that is available at this point is pretty sparse.
However, we do have to recognize that divunal is not yet a commercial
enterprise, and having to juggle other jobs makes finding time to work
on divunal pretty hard. In that same vein I have to applaud those,
namely, Glyph, who are willing to pull all-nighters in order to
coordinate day jobs with game development.

Also, we do need some sort of plan about where exactly divunal is
going, and what the ultimate goal of the game is (if that's possible,
if not, as close as we can come).

I also concur that one of the number one things we need along with
better documentation is a real TODO list. Something heavy-duty
(allowing people to "sign up" for jobs, mark tasks as completed) and
web-based is required. I'd like to volunteer to work on a cgi script
for such a list.

As far as Michael's point about rather having one good writer than two
programmers, I have to disagree. Since the key to divunal is supposed
to be the puzzles, what is necessary is programmers who are also good
writers, a rare breed. Few interesting puzzles can be created at this
time without some sort of coding.

Finally, as far as the current state of the game, i'm afraid that at
this current rate of speed, it's going to be awhile before we have
something that's comparable to the other MUDs/games/whatever that are
currently available. For example, take a look at Avalon
(www.avalon-rpg.com). True, it's direction is a bit different than
ours, but it is really mind-blowing. That's something I would pay for
(if i were into paying for things, which i'm not ;-))....

Still, I have to close this with one thought. Twisted Reality is cool.
I've been trying to write a game framework like this for years, and
some of the features we may take for granted code-wise I never even
thought of when I was developing. Divunal can be incredible...we just
need to work at it.

Subject: [Divunal-author]author efficiency (my two cents)

A few notes:

First of all, I commend Glyph, Dave, and James for putting so much hard
work into TR and Divunal.  It's great to have such a dedicated core of
developers.  I erred in not mentioning this in my letter; it would have
lessened the causticity a bit.  What I was taking issue with was that the
dedicated core needs to be more open with its developments so that the
rest of us can have an easier time creating things, which will distribute,
and thus ease, the load on everyone.

And, even though I come from a Mac background and bitch about poor
interfaces and documentation all the time, I understand how difficult it
is to motivate oneself to write it, even if it's just a couple of
paragraphs.  It feels like you're having to do the development all over
again, just in a different language.

I didn't mean to say that all of this would be easy, just that it's
necessary.  

On to a few specific points:

> I also concur that one of the number one things we need along with

> (allowing people to "sign up" for jobs, mark tasks as completed) and

	And I'll try to get ProjectMaster (a piece of project management
software I've done some design on) started ASAP...though that'll probably
be when school starts.  ::growls about incomplete work::

	Sure, ideally we'd have people who are talented in both areas.
However, it's likely that we'll have people whose strengths are weighted
one way or another, and it's probably going to be easier in most cases to
code a puzzle than it will be to design it.  In any event, I think we
should be open to having people who are "only" writers/designers on board,
and just let them know that they won't necessarily have people at their
beck and call.  It'd be cool, though, to have one or more people designing
things and posting their designs, letting coders grab them as they can.
Less down time that way.

	I can't really comment on the Avalon thing, since I haven't had
the time to look over their site, but I should probably mention that my
conception of Divunal is something more along the lines of a pen-and-paper
RPG, only a bit more autonomous.  (In that the computer takes care of all
the "rolling" and such.)  What killed my addiction to MUDs was the utter
lack of a goal with depth--killing for the sake of killing.  As I
mentioned in my other letter, I don't want us to fall into the same trap
with puzzles.

	On that note, I think we should add something to the TODO list: a
mission statement.  It'll be a lot easier to design things, including the
plot and the world, when we know what effect we're trying to achieve.


	Work's over.  Gotta go.

Thank you for the praise.  In kind, I would like to thank you for several 
of these:

date: 1999/08/03 15:42:40;  author: trcvs;  state: Exp;  lines: +1 -1
TR/CVS 0.1 COMMIT MESSAGE. Guyute IS RESPONSIBLE.

In terms of getting anything productive done, though :-), I'd like to
address the first part of that paragraph:

"the documentation that is available at this point is pretty sparse."

Not that I disagree, but I'd be *very* interested ot hear which pieces of
the documentation need revision and addition.  If I got a message every
single day on this mailinglist asking for a clarification on some part of
the Divunal societal structure or the code infrastructure, I couldn't be
happier -- as long as it was a specific, targeted question which I could
answer with something other than a long, laborious process of writing
down EVERYTHING I know about Divunal in the hopes that that was what
everyone wanted to know.

> Also, we do need some sort of plan about where exactly divunal is

I don't understand what's so unclear about where it's going, either... the
basic idea is to construct a world that's a lot of fun to interact with
other people and solve puzzles in.  Like many worlds, there is no ultimate
goal to the world.  While there are many themes, the central one is fairly
philosophical, and still evolving (although in a few weeks, I should be
able to write a concise essay describing it), and there is no "point" to
it all.  It's just some stuff.  There should also be no "main" plot. There
are a few which are more important than others, but if it turns out that
nobody gives a damn about Maxwell's angst, and they're all concerned with
the state of the underground city and Tsiale's mysterious past, well,
then, we concentrate more on developing the areas where there's interest
than where there isn't.

Agreed.  Although Mike's ProjectMaster CGI sounds interesting, it sounds
like it might be much more comprehensive than what we need (especially to
start) and I wouldn't mind pulling another all-nighter to complete
something.

Before *anybody* does something drastic like that though, does anyone
listening to this list know whether or not the Mozilla

And as I said in response to Mike's email, you're both wrong :-)
Writer/programmers are nice (Dave and I are able to run the project
because we can do both) but we need to foster cooperation between writers
and programmers.  A TODO list would greatly facilitate this.

Please consider the first item on that list (until we have an official
TODO website) to be: write a home for your archetype, if you have one, and
find someone who has one to bother and help with the construction of their
home.

Aye.  There's the rub.

I'm not satisfied with this rate of progress, and I'm not willing to
merely acknowledge it as the rate at which we will continue working. Since
some of the slowdown has been my fault directly (despite my few dramatic
all-nighters, I haven't been working on this as much as I should be) I am
going to pick up my slack, and I'd like to see other authors do the same,
hence my email :-)

Thanks much! :-)

Although I've been driving it to completion lo these many years, TR has

can't use this social on an object, just put "cfoundobj Silly you can't do

o=other in the field names.

Escape codes for use in social strings:
$$ = $ (two dollar signs together makes one in the output)

Subject: [Divunal-author]Doors

I've improved the way doors work to allow for greater realism.  Now,
opening and closing a door not only blocks the exit, they inform people
that the door was opened/closed, are compliant with TR's perspectives,
and--perhaps most importantly--it dynamically alters the descriptions of
the rooms the door connects, adding and removing strings to reflect the
door's change of state.  This is to eliminate rooms that had descriptions
along the lines of, "To a steel doorway to the south, you see a row of
bookcases", even when the southern door was closed.  

*Please make use of this.*  Convert your old doors as well.  It'll mean a
little extra work, but it will be well worth it.

On a related note, there is now a "locked" boolean property on doors to
indicate whether or not they're locked.  (Big surprise.)  I will be adding
more w/regard to this and keys shortly.

This also involved the creation of the divunal.door.Door utility class,
which currently has two each of open() and close() methods, for greater
customizability; locks and associated stuff will be in there soon.
divunal.door.Open and .Close (the files for the associated verbs) make use

Subject: [Divunal-author]Re: [Divunal-devel] release criterea

Well, you covered a lot of what I would say, so this is going to reiterate
things a bit.

I think that we should start by getting a big wishlist--a brain dump of
features, fixes, etc.--from everyone.  This should include specific
technical stuff (e.g. "Add a StringHandler class") as well as general
ideas, (e.g. "figure out what to do with amounts of items, like water and
gold").  Personally, I think docs should be on this list, too.  I'd hope
that people would be comfortable speaking their minds on this, even if
they haven't done a lot of development.  (They may still have ideas for
what would be nifty to have in a game.  This is why I CC'd the author
list; though everyone may be on both at this point....)

The list could then be culled for stuff that's already in and things that
are bad design ideas.  (This could also be handy for a reference on what
needs to be documented and/or what people need to be informed of.  If lots
are clamoring for a feature that's already in there, it's time for some
communication.)

What remains should then be prioritized, putting those "API-breaking
changes" and related stuff at the top of the list.  Then, break the list
into bite-sized pieces and make those releases.

Of course, people can (and should) continue developing stuff that they
really want to develop, but this would at least give some direction to
development and releases and might help out anyone who's been wondering
what's needed on the server side.  Also, I'm sure the pieces would be
adaptable to stuff like unforseen problems and the like.

This doesn't really answer the versioning number question, but I think
that's secondary to establishing what's going into the releases.  Also,
since TR 1.0 is going to be so fanstastically better compared to what's
out there now--much of which is in much later version numbers--I have
trouble saying what the gradations should be.  (I'm also more familiar
with the principle of incremental development than the mystical nature of
the version number, too.)

That's my $0.02

When you make an object, please remember to give it a reasonable list of
synonyms.  *Especially* if the object has a string property for its name!  

"A yellow paperback book is here"

"There is no yellow paperback book here."

That's rather counterintuitive...

Is there a reason why, when the search routine is going through a verbs

You may have noticed that activity on Divunal has been rather slow lately.
We here at TME are trying to organize our schedules to fit more Vitamin D.
into our daily diet, but I'm curious as to why the project as a whole has
suffered such dramatic brain-drain.

Things seem to be perking back up, but I'd like to hear from some, if not
all of you, what you think the problems with the way that Divunal is set
up?  Is this a fantastically coincidental problem with individual
schedules, or an issue with the way the project is being run?

I don't want to be a bother, but if those of you on this list aren't
really interested in helping out by doing web-design, making areas,
writing code... please just let me know.  If I've screwed up somehow, and
you *can't* contribute for some reason, I'd like to hear that too.

I want to know if it's a waste of time to be maintaining the authoring
website going forward, or if Dave and I should just throw our backs into
just writing the game, maintaining our "bible" scribbled on the backs of
napkins and such.

Also, if there's something crucial that you've all been waiting for, it
would be good to know what it is, so we can really make the best of what
resources we have.

Thanks for listening.  We now return you to your regularly scheduled SPAM.

Subject: [Divunal-author]author efficiency

(This is long; please bear with me.)

Glyph--

	While the slowdown is certainly a result of scheduling and other
issues on my part, I think there are several things about Divunal and the
way it's managed that need to be improved.  I'll discuss my problems and
then suggest solutions, so bear with me.  The changes I see being needed
fall into two basic categories: project organization/management and game
design.

	We need to be more independent of you and Dave (Y&D).  At this
point, that's really tough to do, mainly because there isn't much in the
way of documentation about the world, features available, or how to get at
those nifty features.  It's really not feasable to do much creation or
coding without having an AIM or IRC session open to Y&D because of this,
and that's not the best use of anyone's time.  Also, there's evidently a
bunch of stuff that's been decided/developed that no one outside of Y&D
know about, e.g. the magic system.  I've had many a discussion with you
where I've been told that something--history, area, feature, etc.--has
already been dealt with; none of us outside of DCIT knew about it, though.
(Or I wouldn't have asked.)  At the risk of sounding caustic (which I
don't mean to be), it often seems that Ridgefield is like a secret lab or
monestary, which occassionally feeds those of us outside the fold a little
morsel of knowledge to keep us feeling like we're involved.
	In your email, you ask us to let you know if we're not interested
in doing stuff.  My question is: what stuff needs to be done?  There's no
list anywhere, and I know that I've come up with ideas for things only to
have them rebuffed as unecessary, not crucial, or already done.  Again, we
shouldn't have go to Y&D for this: there should be a list of things to do
posted on the web site, covering at least programming, web stuff, docs,
and writing/design.  I want to make a note about the last of these.  I've
been explicitly told that we really don't need people who can't code.  I
think that's wrong--I'd rather have one good writer than two great
programmers: we have (most of) the tech we need; now we need puzzles, a
world, and a plot.

	This brings me to what's become my biggest concern: what is this
game about?  We still haven't answered this question.  Yes, we've got "an
immersive, text-based environment", but that doesn't say much about the
game itself.  It's like only telling someone that Baldur's Gate is a CRPG,
or that Zork is a puzzle-solving game.  We've talked about it being
puzzle-centric, but we haven't any real reason for people to solve
puzzles, and without one, we're fundamentally the same as a MUD.  There,
people kill stuff for the sake of killing stuff; in Divunal, they solve
puzzles for the sake of solving puzzles.  
	The amnesia thing is an interesting idea, but it's still
insufficient, at least in the long term.  Why should I want to find out
about my past?  Why is it important to me?  If there's no effect on myself
or the world once I figure out who I was (or while I'm figuring it out),
then there's little motivation to do it, and it becomes little more than a
gimmick.
	Figuring out the plot--the central idea of the game--is *hard*,
but it's at the heart of any RPG.  Our job is especially difficult b/c of
the multiplayer element.  Still, we need to give the players distinct
goals to pursue, and reasons to pursue them, or we're going to end up with
a bunch of puzzle-solving machines and waste the richness of the world.  I
should note that a lack of long-term, complex goals is exactly what kills
the role-playing in MUDs, and it'll do the same to us if we're not
careful.  On the flip side, if we can come up with something good, we will
*rock*.
	What I said above applies to this, too.  While plot, world, etc.
elements can be developed in an ivory tower, everyone else should know
about them ASAP.  In fact, the initial development is probably better done
by a small group: devising ideas in a committee is basically impossible.
Still, when something's developed, it should be posted quickly so people
can use and/or critique it.

	Finally, you need to trust us.  I've also had several
conversations where we've talked about things, esp. stuff outside the
library, and I've basically been told, "Dave and I are doing everything
outside of the library.  The rest of you can stay in your sandbox and play
where you won't hurt anyone."  I understand that there's a certain amount
of learning that needs to happen, but comments like that, the fact that
there's almost no documentation (making it hard to learn), and us having
to filter all of our web site stuff through you (stuff which doesn't
always get looked at),  make me feel like you want to keep a very tight
rein on us, that you have to be in control of every little detail.  Think
of it like being a parent: how will you ever trust us unless you give us a
chance to prove ourselves?  (Esp. when we haven't done anything to make
you think otherwise, AFAIK.  Is this residue from previous projects?)

	Those are my biggest problems; perhaps I should have mentioned
them sooner, but I have to admit that I was worried they wouldn't be
considered b/c I haven't done a huge amount of work on the game yet.  In
any event, I'm certainly not one to gripe about something without trying
to devise some solutions, so here are some "action items" that Y&D and the
rest of us can do:

	- *This is the most important* Y&D, as the guys in the know,
should shift your focus away from adding new things and put your energy
into documenting what already exists.  This will allow the rest of us to
work independently and faster in a shorter amount of time.  The
documentation should include at least: what the design parameters are
(i.e. what guidelines exist for creating new areas and adding to existing
ones, e.g. what do I have to keep in mind if I want to add to the
underground city?), what features we have available and how they work
(e.g. extending, those popup windows), and the history, society, etc. of
Divunal.
	- Everyone: when you learn something, either through talking to
G&D or by figuring it out on your own, document it, even if it's small.
Less work for everyone that way.
	- Figure out a plot--what the characters should be trying to
achieve
	- Post a wish list
	- Update the documentation and post to the list as soon as
something new is decided on or developed

	Basically, I don't think we're *ready* to be working hardcore on
Divunal.  There's a lot of foundational work that needs to be done before
we're going to be in a position to make a good story and a good game.

Subject: [Divunal-author]author efficiency (my two cents)

On one hand, I certainly agree with what Michael has said. Primarily,
the documentation that is available at this point is pretty sparse.
However, we do have to recognize that divunal is not yet a commercial
enterprise, and having to juggle other jobs makes finding time to work
on divunal pretty hard. In that same vein I have to applaud those,
namely, Glyph, who are willing to pull all-nighters in order to
coordinate day jobs with game development.

Also, we do need some sort of plan about where exactly divunal is
going, and what the ultimate goal of the game is (if that's possible,
if not, as close as we can come).

I also concur that one of the number one things we need along with
better documentation is a real TODO list. Something heavy-duty
(allowing people to "sign up" for jobs, mark tasks as completed) and
web-based is required. I'd like to volunteer to work on a cgi script
for such a list.

As far as Michael's point about rather having one good writer than two
programmers, I have to disagree. Since the key to divunal is supposed
to be the puzzles, what is necessary is programmers who are also good
writers, a rare breed. Few interesting puzzles can be created at this
time without some sort of coding.

Finally, as far as the current state of the game, i'm afraid that at
this current rate of speed, it's going to be awhile before we have
something that's comparable to the other MUDs/games/whatever that are
currently available. For example, take a look at Avalon
(www.avalon-rpg.com). True, it's direction is a bit different than
ours, but it is really mind-blowing. That's something I would pay for
(if i were into paying for things, which i'm not ;-))....

Still, I have to close this with one thought. Twisted Reality is cool.
I've been trying to write a game framework like this for years, and
some of the features we may take for granted code-wise I never even
thought of when I was developing. Divunal can be incredible...we just
need to work at it.

Subject: [Divunal-author]author efficiency (my two cents)

A few notes:

First of all, I commend Glyph, Dave, and James for putting so much hard
work into TR and Divunal.  It's great to have such a dedicated core of
developers.  I erred in not mentioning this in my letter; it would have
lessened the causticity a bit.  What I was taking issue with was that the
dedicated core needs to be more open with its developments so that the
rest of us can have an easier time creating things, which will distribute,
and thus ease, the load on everyone.

And, even though I come from a Mac background and bitch about poor
interfaces and documentation all the time, I understand how difficult it
is to motivate oneself to write it, even if it's just a couple of
paragraphs.  It feels like you're having to do the development all over
again, just in a different language.

I didn't mean to say that all of this would be easy, just that it's
necessary.  

On to a few specific points:

	And I'll try to get ProjectMaster (a piece of project management
software I've done some design on) started ASAP...though that'll probably
be when school starts.  ::growls about incomplete work::

	Sure, ideally we'd have people who are talented in both areas.
However, it's likely that we'll have people whose strengths are weighted
one way or another, and it's probably going to be easier in most cases to
code a puzzle than it will be to design it.  In any event, I think we
should be open to having people who are "only" writers/designers on board,
and just let them know that they won't necessarily have people at their
beck and call.  It'd be cool, though, to have one or more people designing
things and posting their designs, letting coders grab them as they can.
Less down time that way.

	I can't really comment on the Avalon thing, since I haven't had
the time to look over their site, but I should probably mention that my
conception of Divunal is something more along the lines of a pen-and-paper
RPG, only a bit more autonomous.  (In that the computer takes care of all
the "rolling" and such.)  What killed my addiction to MUDs was the utter
lack of a goal with depth--killing for the sake of killing.  As I
mentioned in my other letter, I don't want us to fall into the same trap
with puzzles.

	On that note, I think we should add something to the TODO list: a
mission statement.  It'll be a lot easier to design things, including the
plot and the world, when we know what effect we're trying to achieve.


	Work's over.  Gotta go.

Thank you for the praise.  In kind, I would like to thank you for several 
of these:

date: 1999/08/03 15:42:40;  author: trcvs;  state: Exp;  lines: +1 -1
TR/CVS 0.1 COMMIT MESSAGE. Guyute IS RESPONSIBLE.

In terms of getting anything productive done, though :-), I'd like to
address the first part of that paragraph:

"the documentation that is available at this point is pretty sparse."

Not that I disagree, but I'd be *very* interested ot hear which pieces of
the documentation need revision and addition.  If I got a message every
single day on this mailinglist asking for a clarification on some part of
the Divunal societal structure or the code infrastructure, I couldn't be
happier -- as long as it was a specific, targeted question which I could
answer with something other than a long, laborious process of writing
down EVERYTHING I know about Divunal in the hopes that that was what
everyone wanted to know.

I don't understand what's so unclear about where it's going, either... the
basic idea is to construct a world that's a lot of fun to interact with
other people and solve puzzles in.  Like many worlds, there is no ultimate
goal to the world.  While there are many themes, the central one is fairly
philosophical, and still evolving (although in a few weeks, I should be
able to write a concise essay describing it), and there is no "point" to
it all.  It's just some stuff.  There should also be no "main" plot. There
are a few which are more important than others, but if it turns out that
nobody gives a damn about Maxwell's angst, and they're all concerned with
the state of the underground city and Tsiale's mysterious past, well,
then, we concentrate more on developing the areas where there's interest
than where there isn't.

Agreed.  Although Mike's ProjectMaster CGI sounds interesting, it sounds
like it might be much more comprehensive than what we need (especially to
start) and I wouldn't mind pulling another all-nighter to complete
something.

Before *anybody* does something drastic like that though, does anyone
listening to this list know whether or not the Mozilla

And as I said in response to Mike's email, you're both wrong :-)
Writer/programmers are nice (Dave and I are able to run the project
because we can do both) but we need to foster cooperation between writers
and programmers.  A TODO list would greatly facilitate this.

Please consider the first item on that list (until we have an official
TODO website) to be: write a home for your archetype, if you have one, and
find someone who has one to bother and help with the construction of their
home.

Aye.  There's the rub.

I'm not satisfied with this rate of progress, and I'm not willing to
merely acknowledge it as the rate at which we will continue working. Since
some of the slowdown has been my fault directly (despite my few dramatic
all-nighters, I haven't been working on this as much as I should be) I am
going to pick up my slack, and I'd like to see other authors do the same,
hence my email :-)

Thanks much! :-)

Although I've been driving it to completion lo these many years, TR has
always benefited greatly from the spare time of bored friends of mine.
Thanks everyone who's contributed code, docs, or even graphics for a
website.

One day, soon, I'll put together a credits file.

1) Apologies!! I posted that huuuge response to divunal-*list* not
divunal-*author*!!!!  Good thing that there wasn't too much spoiler in
there unless you know exactly what we're talking about.  Don't reply to it
-- specifically compose a message to diuvnal-author.

2) I trailed off on one of my sentences in that last email.

Mozilla has made a bunch of project management tools.  I think they might
have made something to manage a TODO list or something.  (Bento, you
alive?  You seemed fairly knowledgable of what Moz. has developed)

Okay, here is how you make socials. Sorry its not too verbose but hopefull
you can figure it out....if not, go read the code. :) Any of the fields can
be omitted, in which case the message just won't be sent then. (ie if you
can't use this social on an object, just put "cfoundobj Silly you can't do
that" and don't specify a ofoundobj). Note that c=character v=victim
o=other in the field names.

Escape codes for use in social strings:
$$ = $ (two dollar signs together makes one in the output)
$[12]n = name of [person/target]
$[12]s = his/her of [person/target]
$[12]m = him/her of [person/target]
$[12]e = he/she of [person/target]

 Example of a socials.txt file... >>>>>
#bite
hidden false
cnoarg You nervously gnaw at your lower lip.
onoarg $1n gnaws nervously at $s lower lip.
cfound You bite $2n!
vfound $1n bites you!
ofound $1n bites $2n!
notfound You can't bite someone who isn't here.
cself You bite yourself on the arm!
oself $1n bites himself on the arm!
ofoundobj $1n bites $2n savagely.  Run you fool!!  Rabid $1n on the loose!
cfoundobj You foam at the mouth and bite the $2n, with a crazed and rabid
look in your eyes.

#smile
hidden true
<etc...>

<more socials.....>

#END
<<<< end example file
hidden is whether someone who can't see you will see the social happen.
Smile e.g. would be hidden. Scream would not.

I found a bunch of bugs in the TR server.  Divunal is down for a while.
It should be up again tomorrow, with a bunch of new features.

Subject: [Divunal-author]Doors

I've improved the way doors work to allow for greater realism.  Now,
opening and closing a door not only blocks the exit, they inform people
that the door was opened/closed, are compliant with TR's perspectives,
and--perhaps most importantly--it dynamically alters the descriptions of
the rooms the door connects, adding and removing strings to reflect the
door's change of state.  This is to eliminate rooms that had descriptions
along the lines of, "To a steel doorway to the south, you see a row of
bookcases", even when the southern door was closed.  

*Please make use of this.*  Convert your old doors as well.  It'll mean a
little extra work, but it will be well worth it.

On a related note, there is now a "locked" boolean property on doors to
indicate whether or not they're locked.  (Big surprise.)  I will be adding
more w/regard to this and keys shortly.

This also involved the creation of the divunal.door.Door utility class,
which currently has two each of open() and close() methods, for greater
customizability; locks and associated stuff will be in there soon.
divunal.door.Open and .Close (the files for the associated verbs) make use
of the new class.

Documentation is at http://www.twistedmatrix.com/authors/doors.html.
Email me with questions, comments, etc., but please read the docs first.

Subject: [Divunal-author]Re: [Divunal-devel] release criterea

Well, you covered a lot of what I would say, so this is going to reiterate
things a bit.

I think that we should start by getting a big wishlist--a brain dump of
features, fixes, etc.--from everyone.  This should include specific
technical stuff (e.g. "Add a StringHandler class") as well as general
ideas, (e.g. "figure out what to do with amounts of items, like water and
gold").  Personally, I think docs should be on this list, too.  I'd hope
that people would be comfortable speaking their minds on this, even if
they haven't done a lot of development.  (They may still have ideas for
what would be nifty to have in a game.  This is why I CC'd the author
list; though everyone may be on both at this point....)

The list could then be culled for stuff that's already in and things that
are bad design ideas.  (This could also be handy for a reference on what
needs to be documented and/or what people need to be informed of.  If lots
are clamoring for a feature that's already in there, it's time for some
communication.)

What remains should then be prioritized, putting those "API-breaking
changes" and related stuff at the top of the list.  Then, break the list
into bite-sized pieces and make those releases.

Of course, people can (and should) continue developing stuff that they
really want to develop, but this would at least give some direction to
development and releases and might help out anyone who's been wondering
what's needed on the server side.  Also, I'm sure the pieces would be
adaptable to stuff like unforseen problems and the like.

This doesn't really answer the versioning number question, but I think
that's secondary to establishing what's going into the releases.  Also,
since TR 1.0 is going to be so fanstastically better compared to what's
out there now--much of which is in much later version numbers--I have
trouble saying what the gradations should be.  (I'm also more familiar
with the principle of incremental development than the mystical nature of
the version number, too.)

That's my $0.02

When you make an object, please remember to give it a reasonable list of
synonyms.  *Especially* if the object has a string property for its name!  

"A yellow paperback book is here"
$ take yellow paperback book
"There is no yellow paperback book here."

That's rather counterintuitive...

Is there a reason why, when the search routine is going through a verbs
list of synonyms, it couldn't also check the "name" string of the
object?
