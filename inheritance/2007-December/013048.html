pleasant for me to share with you. Yes it so. Certainly you also would like
to see my appearance and appeal, all my merits and demerits:). I will
be very glad to send you my photo in the next letter . Than you could
see my appearance:). I have started to use the Internet recently and
so I have a small experience. I am assured that you wish
to find out where we could get acquainted with you. I know that the
Internet very big and a lot of interesting it is possible to find in
it. But I have not remembered all. But I know only one that you have
written the electronic address for me on a dating site.
Forgive that I can not write you the site name. Because I looked many
 dating sites. But when you have written the electronic
address than I was understood that I wish to correspond only with you
and you are very interesting to me.
