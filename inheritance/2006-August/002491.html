Commenting on the data, JP Garnier, GlaxoSmithKline's Chief Executive Officer, said: &quot;These excellent clinical trial results represent a significant breakthrough in the development of our pandemic flu vaccine. This is the first time such a low dose of H5N1 antigen has been able to stimulate this level of strong immune response.
Since the product was first introduced, serious infections, some involving death, have been reported in patients using Enbrel. Patients should tell their doctor if they currently have an infection or are prone to getting infections. Patients should not start Enbrel if they have an infection of any type or an allergy to Enbrel or its components. Enbrel should be used with caution in patients prone to infection.
The decision by the European Commission to grant marketing authorization to Nexavar followed a positive opinion issued by the European Medicines Agency's Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in April this year. Nexavar was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2005 and has since been approved in Switzerland, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Korea, and Argentina. Regulatory filings have been completed in several countries, including Australia, Canada, Turkey, and Japan.
Vioxx annual sales exceeded $2.5 billion during its five years on the market but Merck was forced to withdraw the drug after it was shown to double the risk of heart attack among those taking it for more than 18 months.
&quot;For those psoriatic arthritis patients for whom the use of methotrexate is not appropriate, the approval of Remicade for use as a monotherapy offers a new treatment option for their disease,&quot; said Robert Spiegel, MD, chief medical officer and senior vice president, Schering-Plough Research Institute.
Patients who would like to find out more about biological therapy are advised to talk to their dermatologist.
The Committee found great variation in the income generated by hospitals car parks; while the average parking space generated around ?200, some provincial general hospitals made up to ?2000 per space. 
Nexavar EMEA approval was based on Phase III data from the largest randomized, placebo-controlled trial ever conducted in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. In the Phase III study, Nexavar doubled progression- free survival (PFS) in previously treated patients when compared to placebo. Progression-free survival measures the time that a patient lives without evident tumor growth. In this study, PFS was doubled to a median value of six months in patients receiving Nexavar as compared to three months for patients receiving placebo (p-value &lt; 0.000001). All subgroups examined, including patients who had not received conventional treatment with biologics, such as interleukin-2 or interferon-alpha, appeared to benefit as well. 
This acquisition is via modifications to an existing contract for anthrax therapeutics awarded to Cangene last September. 
The report has revealed that in the year 2004/05 hospitals charged ?78 million for the use of their car parks, ?63 million was paid by visitors and ?15 million by their own hospital staff. 
Ghosh is now expanding on his design, making alterations to the original molecule aimed at making even more effective treatments.
MEM 63908 is a partial agonist of the nicotinic alpha-7 receptor and belongs to a family of novel nicotinic alpha-7 receptor agonists that are being developed under the companies' collaboration. A number of lines of evidence suggest that partial agonists at the nicotinic alpha-7 receptor could have a variety of uses in addressing important diseases of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. 
Merck's lawyer Diane Sullivan made the comments at the conclusion of the third Vioxx trial to be heard in Merck's home state of New Jersey. 
The agency wants the pills kept behind pharmacy counters; women would have to ask for them and those under 18 would still need a prescription.
* Severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not previously treated with methotrexate. 
&quot;Bullying and harassment is not just confined to individuals - more worrying, there is growing evidence that GPs and practices are regularly bullied by NHS bodies like local health boards. An increasingly highly competitive NHS under increasing scrutiny from both government and the public to improve transparency is having an adverse impact on the lives of GPs - this must not be allowed to continue.&quot; 
&quot;The joint involvement and often painful skin lesions associated with psoriatic arthritis, places an extraordinary burden on patients with this potentially progressive disease,&quot; said Douglas Veale, MD, Consultant Rheumatologists, University College of Dublin and St. Vincent's Hospital, Ireland. &quot;In addition to the response of the joints, the PASI 75 response demonstrated in the IMPACT 2 trial should be a new treatment goal sought by rheumatologists who work with these psoriatic arthritis patients.&quot;  
NICE backs use of Enbrel and Raptiva to treat severe psoriasis
The vaccine, which uses a proprietary adjuvant, enabled over 80% of subjects who received 3.8&#231;g of antigen to demonstrate a strong seroprotective immune response. This level of seroprotection meets or exceeds target criteria set by regulatory agencies for registration of influenza vaccines. Efficacy results at these levels of antigen dosage have also not been reported for any other H5N1 vaccine in development to date, including those using other adjuvants such as alum.
* All GP surgeries and NHS bodies to develop a policy for dealing with bullying and harassment. This should include: opportunities for an individual to speak out; opportunities for informal resolution via discussion and mediation; an opportunity to receive an objective investigation into a complaint; and a formal stage to include possible disciplinary action;
The H5N1 strain of avian influenza which first appeared in Asia in 2003 has spread rapidly across the globe and has killed more than 130 people to date.
The FDA usually follows the advice of its advisory panels, but apparently the approval was granted after the company provided the agency with additional information.
Merck's lawyer Diane Sullivan made the comments at the conclusion of the third Vioxx trial to be heard in Merck's home state of New Jersey.
The Committee found great variation in the income generated by hospitals car parks; while the average parking space generated around ?200, some provincial general hospitals made up to ?2000 per space.
Ghosh began his work at the University of Illinois and set out to design and synthesize a molecule that would interact with a part of the virus that did not change as the rest of it mutated - the backbone of protease.
Memory Pharmaceuticals has announced that it has achieved a set of defined preclinical milestones in its collaboration with Roche for the discovery and development of nicotinic alpha-7 receptor agonists for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders, triggering a commitment from Roche to provide approximately $2.3 million in research funding during 2007.
