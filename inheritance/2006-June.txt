FINALLY A NATURALL SUPPRESSANT THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE 


What if you could fool your brain into believing 
that you are full? 
Amazing, but true! 


Imagine the weight that you could lose if you 
could JUST REDUCE your appetite. This miracle drug 
has been around for thousands of years but only 
recently has it been made available to the general 
population. 
Hoodia is an ugly cactus that grows deep inside 
the African Kalahari desert thriving in extremely 
high temperatures. The San Bushmen of the Kalahari, 
one of the world's oldest and most primitive tribes, 
have been eating the Hoodia plant for more than 
100,00 years to stave off hunger during long 
hunting trips. 


After 30 years of scientific research, 
Hoodia is finally available for modern man! 


Order online securely from our website

You've seen it on "Oprah", "60 Minutes" and read 
the BBC News report . now find out just what 
everyone is talking about and get yourself some Hoodia 
Maximum Strength today!

SPRING, TX--(MARKET WIRE)-- Coil
Tubing Technology, Inc. (CTBG) announces the delivery of the
first group of 8 Rotating Tools to oil and gas well service companies
operating in Mexico and Oklahoma. Designed for use in "fishing"
applications utilizing 2" coiled tubing strings, these tools were
delivered and "in the field" the week of May 1, 2006 swotters

In addition, CTBG has received orders for ten more of these 2 7/8"
Rotating Tool units, plus five 2 1/8" Rotating Tools, all of which are
scheduled for delivery to customers before the end of the month of May.

endosome

CTBG offers the only fully rotating tool for well fishing
applications," stated Jerry Swinford, President of Coil Tubing
Technology, Inc. "Other tools in the marketplace only 'index' or 'turn'
in 90 degree increments without fully rotating, which is an inefficient
means of latching a fish. We are delighted by the overwhelming response
from customers regarding the capabilities of these tools." lifelines

haemamoeba

The Rotating Tool is a device that attaches to the end of a coiled tube
to assist with "latching a fish," or removing production kits or
undesired obstructions from the well by introducing rotation under
mechanical pressure. The design and action of the tool is similar to a
"Yankee screwdriver." If, for example, during normal operations, a
piece of coiled tube is broken off and remains lodged in the wellbore,
it can be difficult to get the new coiled tubing line past the
obstruction. By introducing rotation to the "overshot," or latching
mechanism at the end of the tool, obstructions can be cleared without
the need to manually work the tool through the well head. celeste

Coil Tubing Technology was established in 1998 by an innovative founder
that has over thirty years experience in the design of oil-field tools
in general and fifteen years of experience in the design of proprietary
tools for the coiled tubing industry in particular. With more than
fifteen patents either granted or pending, CTBG is the leader in
providing new technology to the coiled tubing industry. CTBG has become
a one stop rental tool company supplying a full line of standard as
well as propietary coiled tubing downhole tools. scuttlebutt

COILED TUBING DRILLING TOOLS

The Jet Motor maximizes torque and RPM combinations. This motor has the
capability to establish bit hydraulics. The long life bearing package
allows the tool to stay in the hole longer than average. It can be
jarred without damaging the tool which is ideal for drilling through
shale. The Jet Motor has been used successfully with MWD and steering
tools in drilling applications. The nitrogen power source permits
underbalanced drilling. drawsheet

stercoromas

The Pulsator allows the weight on the bit to be maximized without
stalling the motor as the torsional and axial torque are retained
within the tool. The maximum tensible strength allows high energy
jarring impact while the tool prevents spike loading from migrating up
into the generic tool strings. reallotting

The HeavyHitter, when used on the upstroke only, provides variable
tensible overpull due to its hydraulic metered detent system. The
minimum axial drag at detent release provides high velocity of the
hammer mass to the anvil. dingbats

THE COIL TUBING BUSINESS

The coiled tubing industry continues to be one of the fastest growing
segments of the oilfield services sector, and for good reason. CT
growth has been driven by attractive economics, continual advances in
technology, and utilization of CT to perform an ever-growing list of
field operations. Coiled tubing today is a global, multi billion dollar
industry in the mainstream of energy extraction technology. checkpointing

FUTURE TRENDS IN COIL TUBING SERVICES

According to Andy Rike, President of Technicoil USA Corp., a CT service
company with operations in Canada and the US, "We see market growth for
coiled tubing services to independent producers in three areas:
fracturing, particularly multiple interval completions; re-entry
drilling of horizontal laterals or vertical extensions in older wells;
and "grassroots" drilling of shallower wells, including many coalbed
methane wells." fete

mounds

Rike adds that one of the most important reasons for growth of coiled
tubing drilling services has been the development of more integrated
units. "In past years, coiled tubing units were not able to provide the
sort of integrated set of equipment capabilities needed for drilling
and completion operations. This led to an amalgamation of service
company systems cobbled together on site and a situation where the
safety, speed and size advantages of CT were being lost." Now,
Technicoil as well as a few other companies have designed and built
integrated CT units that incorporate everything needed to drill a well
into four trailer loads. When rigged up these units fill a 20,000 sq ft
footprint, less than 1/3 the size of a conventional rig. These newer
units can also drill with conventional pipe, so they can drill a
surface hole and set surface pipe with conventional equipment and then
drill with coiled tubing. boleros

diametrally

In addition to the small footprint, the primary drivers for wider use
of these units are very tight control of well discharges and speed.
"We've drilled 400 feet per hour in some situations," says Rike. The
combination of a smaller hole, lack of connections, faster trip time,
and the higher drilling rates inherent to downhole motors leads to very
rapid drilling rates. Last year, in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico,
Technicoil drilled 26 wells to around 3000 feet for Burlington
Resources over a four month period with one standard CT system. facilitation

gitogenin

Another area of growth is in fracturing, particularly multiple interval
fracturing. One recent example is a five well project in Virginia's
Buchanan County where as many as nineteen intervals were fractured
using coiled tubing and a bottom-hole packer assembly (Rodvelt, 2001).
These wells, part of a CONSOL Energy Inc. coalbed methane project, were
part of a pilot to determine if individually fracturing each of the
zones would result in better recovery. Prior efforts had evolved from
single-stage, limited entry treatments to multiple-stage treatments
with composite frac plugs and frac baffles. plasmacytomata

flotations

Core tests on offset acreage had revealed that 3 of 10 coal seams had
not been stimulated by these treatments and, on average, ten feet of
coal was not being effectively stimulated. If the CT fracturing
approach is successful in improving this situation, CONSOL calculated
that an additional net present value of 1 million could be added per
160-acre lease, based on a gas price of 2.50. The CT fracturing
procedure was a technical success, and hopefully, when the wells are
dewatered and fully evaluated, it will be shown to be an economic
success as well. Other CBM areas have seen similar success. For
example, Barrett Resources experienced a 1.5 fold increase in gas
production from 14 CBM wells in the Raton Basin following stimulation
with coiled tubing versus conventional treatments. "Fracturing is
probably the area with the greatest growth potential," says Rike, "and
coalbed methane is about a third of that market." kame

NEW COIL TUBING MARKETS / FIELD
APPLICATIONS

CT first established it's niche in the marketplace as a cost-effective
well cleanout tool. In recent years, these conventional wellbore
cleanouts and acid stimulation jobs accounted for more than three
quarters of total CT revenue. However, CT use has continued to expand
as it is adopted for use in additional field operations. Most recently,
CT fracturing and drilling applications have emerged as two of the
fastest growth areas. Revenue from these two CT applications has grown
from almost zero 10 years ago, to approximately 15 percent in more
recent times. filmography

GROWTH OF THE SEVICE FLEET

In January 2004, slightly more than 1,050 CT units were estimated to be
available on a worldwide basis. The total number of working CT units is
up sharply from the roughly 850 units reported in February 2001. At
present, the International market accounts for the bulk of the
currently available CT fleet with more than 425 units. Canada and the
U.S. are estimated to contribute an additional 239 and 253 units,
respectively.

THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY BENEFITS
OF USING COILED TUBING UNITS FOR DRILLING INCLUDE:

The units require about half the space that a conventional drilling rig
requires. The units require less power so there is less fuel
consumption and emissions during drilling. Noise levels are 18 percent
lower than with conventional rigs. zooidal

buoying

There is less visual impact as the units are small with no large
derrick tower. dalators

depside

All of this means that coiled tubing units are more cost effective,
energy efficient, have a much smaller environmental footprint, and
create less waste. In certain drilling operations, coiled tubing units
cost approximately half of what a conventional drill rig would cost. hillside

burgeons

In fact, coiled tubing units are so compact and have such great
potential, the Mars Drilling Project is evaluating modifying,
miniaturizing and fully automating a coiled tubing unit to drill for
water on Mars. Realistically, it will be years before the unit is
developed and sent to by rocket to Mars, but it would be an important
first step before Mars could be colonized. And coiled tubing technology
will be be greatly improved by the research. snifter

Wednesday June 14, 11:19 am ET  

LAS VEGAS, NV, June 14 /FirstCall/ - In finex Ventures Inc.
is pleased to announce that on January 30, 2006, we entered into
an agreement ("Agreement"), with Rodolfo Francisco Villar ("Vendor") to
purchase a 50% interest in the mining and exploration of the following Claims,
the ("Claims"):

    REFERENCES               ROLL NUMBER

144    TESORO 6          1 - 20    03304-0537-6
145    TESORO 7          1 - 25    03304-0538-4
146    TESORO 8          1 - 12    03304-0539-2
147    TESORO 9          1 - 12    03304-0540-6

149    TESORO 11         1 - 20    03304-0542-2
150    TESORO 12         1 - 5     03304-0543-0

These Claims are more particularly located at the northern end of the El Indio Belt in Chile Region III which is approximately 150 kms. East of the City of Vallenar, Chile.

1.  Under the terms of the Agreement, the Vendor will grant to the
Company the sole and exclusive irrevocable right and title to the
Claims, subject to:

(i)   the completion by the Company of confirmation of legal title
and due diligence on the Properties as to ownership by the
Vendor and results therefrom being satisfactory to the Company,
 acting reasonably, within a period of  90 days;

(ii)  the right to extend a further 90 days by mutual consent. (the
right to extend a further 90 days has been granted to the
Company, in an effort to complete its due diligence);

(iii)  The Vendor and the Company shall put forth, all their
reasonable best efforts to obtain a satisfactory title opinion
or Court Order, or such that the Company will acquire the
property free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, with a
view to further develop the property into an operating mine.

2.  Upon satisfactory completion of the due diligence and clear title
being established, the Company will then:

(a)   issue to the Vendor Twenty Million (20,000,000) Common Shares,
upon the execution by the parties of this Agreement and subject
to the subject conditions as set out above; and

(b)   that all original documents or notarized copies of official
translations are therefore required to complete the
transactions contemplated in the Agreement. The issuance of the
20 Million (20,000,000) Common Shares shall be issued in the
Vendors designated name to the benefit of Vendor, upon the
removal of the subject conditions as set out above.

3.  Further, satisfactory completion of the due diligence and clear title
being established the Purchaser with the assistance of the Vendor,
(if necessary), will apply for permits to the appropriate authorities
to place the property into production. Upon the appropriate permits
being approved, the Purchaser will have the option to acquire an
additional 25% interest in the property (bringing the Purchaser
interest to 75%) in exchange for a further issuance of Ten Million
(10,000,000) Common shares of the Company's stock.

We are presently pursuing further due diligence on these Claims.

reasonable best efforts to obtain a satisfactory title opinion
or Court Order, or such that the Company will acquire the
property free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, with a
view to further develop the property into an operating mine.

2.  Upon satisfactory completion of the due diligence and clear title
being established, the Company will then:

(a)   issue to the Vendor Twenty Million (20,000,000) Common Shares,
upon the execution by the parties of this Agreement and subject
to the subject conditions as set out above; and

(b)   that all original documents or notarized copies of official
translations are therefore required to complete the
transactions contemplated in the Agreement. The issuance of the
20 Million (20,000,000) Common Shares shall be issued in the
Vendors designated name to the benefit of Vendor, upon the
removal of the subject conditions as set out above.

3.  Further, satisfactory completion of the due diligence and clear title
being established the Purchaser with the assistance of the Vendor,
(if necessary), will apply for permits to the appropriate authorities
to place the property into production. Upon the appropriate permits
being approved, the Purchaser will have the option to acquire an
additional 25% interest in the property (bringing the Purchaser
interest to 75%) in exchange for a further issuance of Ten Million
(10,000,000) Common shares of the Company's stock.

We are presently pursuing further due diligence on these Claims.

For attention.
We found company ready to EXPLODE!!
Put CGDC on your radar's now. This shows a significant up in 
price and sometimes in days, not months or years.
Watch CGDC like a hawk Monday!! The alert is on!!

CHINA GOLD CORP
Sym: CGDC
Current Price: 0.30

A Company engaged in gold and minerals exploration and development of 
gold and mineral properties in China. 

Why consider CHINA GOLD CORP (CGDC)? Seee n0wadays what happened.

Rising gold prices are further accelerating this gold rush - The 
price of gold has up 250% over the past five years, and this is still only 
a quarter of when the price peaked 25 years ago. (Adjusted for 
inflation.)

HUGE gold discovery in southwestern China - Resources have already 
been estimated by analysts at 14 million ounces...and the number keeps 
climbing.

China is the worlds last great under-explored land-mass - Locked 
away in a Marxist time-warp with limited exploration technology, China 
rich virgin gold fields have been overlooked and ignored until recently.

China is already the world 4th largest producer of gold ?and will 
soon be the world #1 producer AND #1 consumer. The country is going 
gold-crazy!

Foreign gold companies are now welcome - and the laws have been 
changed to provide full legal protection.

You can see China developing gold boom is building momentum. Rare 
0pp0rtunity for early investors!!

Finally it`s Summer!!! But did you look in the mirror lately?

If you`re still overweight read on.....

For years, the weight loss industry has led us to believe
that in order to look great and stay in shape,
you could never eat your favorite foods. 

Now, of course we're not saying that you can eat ice cream
and hamburgers all day, but you can still occasionally
splurge and maintain a healthy lifestyle, 
thanks to our new little secret...

We know it sounds hard to believe, but thousands of people
are doing just that...
thanks to a revolutionary breakthrough 
in natural health science: HoodiaLife

Short-Selling Trigger - (APWL)  Advanced Powerline Technologies, Inc.  expedition

menaquinone

All 3 triggers have gone off.  We received today an email on this, a fax, and a hard-print magazine.  So get ready to start 
selling short, cause we all know that these pump and dump stocks always head back down, way down.
melanonychia

fellations

OK Everybody, we gotta another real gem here.  And you guys are going to love this one. clerically

postpalatine

This one is APWL - Advanced Powerline Technologies, Inc.  Here is the kicker.  This one is being promoted by the same gang of 
losers that brought us PWRM 2 summers ago.  These guys are not easy to find, they skip most every attempt we make to sign up 
as subscribers, or they know who we really are, but this time we snuck through. aspic

litter

If you remember, and if you got in and started selling short when we told you, then how could you forget?  You may remember 
that PWRM went from 40 cents to 8 dollars that summer.  That is a gain of 20-fold.  Most suckers would think that was great, 
but if you were to have sold short and waited you could have bought in at just 10 cents, an 80-fold profit.  You see, this is 
how the big-boys do it, and one thing we know for sure, after these junk stocks go up, they come crashing down much 
harder.shoes

figurings

SO START SELLING NOW

Even if this thing only doubles on the way up, you still can make 10 to 20 times that on the way back down.  These 
shifty-eyed stock promoters are all so greedy, there is no doubt this thing will come crashing down very soon.  To see the 
fax, email, and pdf file of the magazine, just log onto your members page  We have also posted the PWRM from 2 years ago so 
you can see the striking similarities.  These scumbag stock promoters are so lazy they hardly even changed it, just some 
words and the symbol.  Amazing. contradictories

Explosive pick for our members!

PETROSUN DRILLING (PSUD)
Current Price: 1.25

Don't get caught in the dust, start watchin today because this company 
has been known to release major news at any time which could bring the 
st0ck up!!

Current News

PetroSun Announces Formation of Algae BioFuels

PetroSun Drilling Inc. (PSUD - News), an emerging provider of oilfield 
services to major and independent producers of oil and natural gas, 
announced today that the company has formed Algae BioFuels Inc. as a 
wholly owned subsidiary. Algae BioFuels will be engaged in the research and 
development of algae cultivation as an energy source in the production 
of biodiesel, an economically feasible and eco-friendly alternative to 
petroleum-based transportation fuels. The R&D and production facilities 
for Algae BioFuels will be based in Arizona and Australia.

"PetroSun's formation of Algae BioFuels is a forward-looking strategy," 
said L. Rayfield Wright, president of PetroSun. "The 0pp0rtunity to 
produce a renewable energy product that will assist in providing a 
healthier planet for future generations cannot be ignored."

Biofuel is any fuel that is derived from biomass -- which contains 
recently living organisms or their metabolic byproducts. Biofuel is a 
renewable energy source, unlike other natural resources such as petroleum, 
coal and nuclear fuels. Agricultural products specifically grown for use 
as biofuels include corn and soybeans.

Extensive research is currently being conducted to determine the 
utilization of microalgae as an energy source, with applications being 
developed for biodiesel, ethanol, methanol, methane and even hydrogen. 
Independent studies have demonstrated that algae is capable of producing 30 
times more oil per acre than the current crops now utilized for the 
production of biofuels. Algae biofuel contains no sulfur, is non-toxic and 
highly biodegradable.

The Office of Fuels Development, a division of the Department of 
Energy, funded a program from 1978 through 1996 under the National Renewable 
Energy Laboratory known as the "Aquatic Species Program." The focus of 
this program was to investigate high-oil algae that could be grown 
specifically for the purpose of wide-scale biodiesel production. Some 
species of algae are ideally suited to biodiesel production due to their 
high oil content, in excess of 50%, and extremely rapid growth rates.

One of the biggest advantages of biodiesel, compared to many other 
alternative transportation fuels, is that it can be used in existing diesel 
engines, which relieves automotive manufacturers of having to make 
costly engine modifications. Biodiesel can also be mixed, at any ratio, 
with conventional petroleum diesel. As a result, the alternative fuel can 
be used in the current distribution infrastructure, replacing petroleum 
diesel either wholly, or as a diesel fuel blend with minimal 
integration costs.

About PetroSun

PetroSun's current operations are concentrated in the Ark-La-Tex region 
with plans to expand into New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Australia in 
2006. PetroSun provides a comprehensive array of products and services to 
the oil industry. The company's cutting-edge technologies, combined 
with a proven ability to apply them effectively and safely within a 
disciplined ROI framework, creates long-term value for PetroSun shareholders 
and partners. PetroSun is headquartered in Phoenix.
