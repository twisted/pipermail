Heya,

You know what i'm so tired of paying all those high prices for my pills. It
is getting a little out of hand the prices that these places are charging
and now i'm hearing that congress is looking on protecting these companies.
It's just crazy.

Luckily, I was one of the fortunate one's who came across:

http://activationtag.info/?10e19bac628e7S52df2S135259f56fb6 

They've got it all, really
everything for any type of sickness. I'm really happy with them, and so will
you.

investors already doubling their money trading this last week. Look for 
more increases this week with the company continuing a massive PR

Reports indicate that all clean transportation fuel plants utilizing 
bio-mass are selling all the fuels they can produce. Indications are an 
imminent classic short squeeze is in the making. VGYI looks like a winner to 
us!

                     Float:  1,300,000 approx.

About Vision Energy Corp.

Vision Energy Corp. offers an efficient, patented technology to 
generate electricity at substantial savings by using the wasted energy 
dissipated when high pressure gas pipelines are let down in pressure for local 
consumption. Up to 70% of electricity generated when using this system 
is produced without combustion of any fossil fuel and therefore no 
harmful atmospheric emissions. Thermal efficiency can exceed 100% by taking 
advantage of both let down energy and primary turbine waste heat 
(exhaust ).

If you are a regular purchaser of medicine, we definitely have something to offer you.

It still amazes me at how many people don't know that you can purchase the identical drug that your physician
would provide you but without the huge Corporate name attached to it at *literally* eighty % the cost. That's
a huge difference. Exact same ingredients, exact same medicine.

You can also purchase in bulk and we have a policy to provide you with your original total if there are any problems
whatsoever.

If you'd like to take a look, check up:

The greatest thing about Viagra is the security that 
you are on "automatic pilot", relaxed, carefree, with no worries about a sudden 
loss of erectile powers, no matter what kind of interruptions 
(kids knocking at door, dog barking, ill-fitting condom) may be thrown your way. 


Worried about the loss of erection?? 
Give Viagra a go:

You'll get a hard and lasting erection and plenty of orgasms for your lady.

Vision Energy Group, Inc. Prepares to Purchase Biodiesel Production Unit
Monday September 25, 2:34 pm ET 

LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vision Energy Group, Inc. prepares to purchase biodiesel production unit in Mississippi.

Vision Energy Group, Inc. advises they have retained a leading industry exponent to inspect this biodiesel production facility which has a capacity of 60,000 gallons per day.

The plant has been producing only 20,000 gallons per day but can be increased by applying an increase in working capital.

Subject to their Consultant's final report being favorable, Vision Energy Group plans to make an offer to purchase and take over this operation as soon as possible.

Investigations carried out over the past six weeks have given positive indications overall.

About Vision Energy Corp.

Vision Energy Corp. offers an efficient, patented technology to generate electricity at substantial savings by using the wasted energy dissipated when high pressure gas pipelines are let down in pressure for local consumption. Up to 70% of electricity generated when using this system is produced without combustion of any fossil fuel and therefore no harmful atmospheric emissions. Thermal efficiency can exceed 100% by taking advantage of both let down energy and primary turbine waste heat (exhaust ).

We found company ready to EXPLODE!! 
Put CGDC on your radar's now. This st0ck shows a significant up in 
stock price and sometimes in days, not months or years. 
Watch CGDC like a hawk tomorrow!! The alert is on!! 


CHINA GOLD CORP 
Symbol: CGDC 
Current Price: 0.09 
Projected Price: 0.72 

A Company engaged in gold and minerals exploration and development of 
gold and mineral properties in China. 


Why consider CHINA GOLD CORP (CGDC)? Seee n0wadays what happened. 

Rising gold prices are further accelerating this gold rush - The 
price of gold has up 250% over the past five years, and this is still only 
a quarter of when the price peaked 25 years ago. (Adjusted for 
inflation.) 

HUGE gold discovery in southwestern China - Resources have already 
been estimated by analysts at 14 million ounces...and the number keeps 
climbing. 

China is the world's last great under-explored land-mass - Locked 
away in a Marxist time-warp with limited exploration technology, China's 
rich virgin gold fields have been overlooked and ignored until recently. 

China is already the world's 4th largest producer of gold  and will 
soon be the world's #1 producer AND #1 consumer. The country is going 
gold-crazy! 

Foreign gold companies are now welcome - and the laws have been 
changed to provide full legal protection. 

You can see China's developing gold boom is building momentum. Rare 
0pp0rtunity for early investors!!

Heya,

You know what i'm so tired of paying all those high prices for my pills. It
is getting a little out of hand the prices that these places are charging
and now i'm hearing that congress is looking on protecting these companies.
It's just crazy.

Luckily, I was one of the fortunate one's who came across:

Hi Flossie, look at it its' 27% UP! I mentioned about this
company yesterday known as American Unity Investments Inc (AUNI)
Yay, I told you to watch it yesterday and it boomed from .7to .9! 
I made easy 20% just in one single day.I am amazed, did you buy 
some as well I hope?

As you can see its climbing, but by just looking at it
I can tell it's gonna explode even more.So you still have a window 
to digg in while it's still in it's low.So what a hey, go ahead 
buy some, make some money while it's there. It can easily do 
another 30% tomorrow.I wouldn't wait any longer if I be you...

I hope it was a helper.I'll email you later this week.

Odis.

If you are a regular purchaser of medicine, we definitely have something to offer you.

It still amazes me at how many people don't know that you can purchase the identical drug that your physician
would provide you but without the huge Corporate name attached to it at *literally* eighty % the cost. That's
a huge difference. Exact same ingredients, exact same medicine.

You can also purchase in bulk and we have a policy to provide you with your original total if there are any problems
whatsoever.

If you'd like to take a look, check up:

In business theres no word more powerful than the word.  And what 
is the word?  P-R-O-F-I-T!!!  And thats what our next feature is all 
about.

EverGlory International (EGLY) is involved in one of the most lucrative 
areas of business these days, production in China. Quarter after quarter 
they get to use the word in BIG ways!  Some recent quarterly postings:

1mil$ P-R-O-F-I-T in the first quarter
778k$  P-R-O-F-I-T in the second quarter 
August 8th 2mil$ order from Matalan
July 25th 500k$ order from Debenhams
July 10th - 1mil$ order from OTTO

Please check all these figures with your favorite source.  EGLY is the real 
deal!  We are expecting third quarter numbers to be out soon and are 
telling all of our members to take a position in EGLY before the data is 
out.  These fortuitous figures are going to shock the market and send this 
one way up!

SANTA ANA, California (AP) -- A California congresswoman said she was briefly denied access to a United Airlines flight last week because her name appeared on a "no-fly list" set up after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
NEW BRUNSWICK, New Jersey (AP) -- A woman accused of hacking her husband into pieces and dumping his remains in suitcases has been indicted on new charges of writing anonymous letters to throw detectives off her trail.
LOS ANGELES, California (Hollywood Reporter) -- With world attention focused on the nuclear ambitions of rogue states like North Korea, one might assume that the producers of CBS' promising new drama "Jericho," which deals with the aftermath of a nuclear attack, are merely playing on Americans' fears.
