<PRE>Harris Exploration Hits Gold!

Inner sources from the survey site said that Harris Exploration has made
a big discovery.  Word is that results show a 12.5 gm/T
rating on the property.  With onsite equipment able to 
process 100 tons a day it equates to yields of 1250 gm/day.
At current market prices this would generate yearly earnings of over $10mil.

Taking into consideration both the size and the high soil
ratings this gives HXPN a book value of roughly $5.00 which
we have pegged as our target price.
