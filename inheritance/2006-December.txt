DONT LOST THIS CONCENT:Information in this report may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21B of the SEC Act of 1934, statements that involve discussions of future events.
Don't rely on them. Past performance isn't indicative of future results.
We received five hundred thousand free trading shares from a third party, not an officer, director or affiliate. We intend to sell all five hundred thousand shares now, which could cause the stock to go down.
This company has: an accumulated deficit, nominal cash, nominal revenues in its most recent quarter, a nominal judgement against it, back taxes due and the float of stock is currently increasing. These factors raise doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. A failure to finance could cause the company to stop operating. There isn't adequate, current information available on this company. This is a high risk stock. This report shall not be construed as any kind of investment advice or solicitation.

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,
Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,
Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,
Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

Possible Interpretation: World War II propaganda illustrating the perils of gossip Cobbler, stick to thy last Possible Interpretation: Women do not like the nice guys People who live in glass houses shouldn't play golf No money, no justice At least in Louisianiraq
We are all in this together Grace Hopper Hope is life
Law is the solemn expression of legislative will CODE NAPOLEON Measure twice, cut once Kill not the goose that laid the golden egg A watched kettle never boils
Possible Interpretation: Do not take on more responsibility than you can handle at any one time Truth is stranger than fiction It's a long lane that has no turning If you can't be good, be careful Attributed to Benjamin Franklin; Poor Richard's Almanac Possible Interpretation: Do not rush into what you do not know
Owt for nowt, and a penny change There's no time like the present Glazing like a Stat - [Cornish] Glazing == Staring, Stat == Stoat, so you would be 'Staring like a Stoat' Variant: Ornithological specimen of corresponding plumage congregate gregariously
Make love, not war If at first you don't succeed, try, try again A beer a day keeps the germs away Possible Interpretation: All style and no substance Garbage in, garbage out

The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite.

Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

You cannot make big returns on an oil company AFTER huge
profits are reported.  You also can't make them by getting 
in AFTER successful drilling results.  Everyone needs a 
helping hand at getting in BEFORE the big events, and 
that's what we are giving you here.

Great product, great sector, tightly held, with great 
results expected any day.  Cana Petroleum is going to make 
you a winner!

Current Price: Around  $0.78

Watch it on Tuesday, December 5th.  This one is going to 
have you wearing a big smile all day long!  

Major oil discovery?  We are not permitted to say at this 
point.  All we can say is that this one is going to see 
amazing appreciation in a very short period of time!  This 
is your opportunity.  Excel with CNPM!

We told you yesterday that this one was going to move!  Now 
we see solid volume and nice gains.  But this is just the
beginning!  The news hasn't even hit the street yet.  We
think you have one last day to get in before CNPM takes off!

Great product, great sector, tightly held, with great
results expected any day.  Cana Petroleum is going to make
you a winner!

Symbol: CNPM
Current Price: Around  $0.79 
Projected Price:       $5.40

Watch it on Wednesday, December 6th!

Major acquisition?  We are not allowed to give that 
information out yet.  But what we can say is that you are 
going to see amazing appreciation in a very short period of 
time!  This is your opportunity.  Make it with CNPM!  
Last time when we sent this stock everybody earned. Top brockers earned $100k+. Hurry up!

These days it's like the dot com revolution round two.  The 
only difference is, this time there will be no crash.  
Everyone is wiser and the internet has already proven that 
it is THE place to do business.

Acquisitions are happening at a record pace.  Google 
picking up Youtube. News corp picking up Myspace, the list 
goes on.  

In all of these acquisitions those that are already holding 
an interest in these smaller companies are making a fortune 
in the process.  Word on the street is that our next pick 
is about to be acquired by a big player!

Premier Holdings Group 

Symbol: PMHD
Current Price:   0.37
Target price:    1.35

PMHD is a high tech company involved in a wide range of 
internet related businesses from broadband to online 
commerce.  This is one hot item!

Remember, we get you the inside scoop BEFORE it hits the 
street.  With the acquisition set to be announced shortly 
the time to act is now.  Once the word is out it will be 
too late to get in, as we expect this one to go up quickly.

These days it's like the dot com revolution round two.  The 
only difference is, this time there will be no crash.  
Everyone is wiser and the internet has already proven that 
it is THE place to do business.

Acquisitions are happening at a record pace.  Google 
picking up Youtube. News corp picking up Myspace, the list 
goes on.  

In all of these acquisitions those that are already holding 
an interest in these smaller companies are making a fortune 
in the process.  Word on the street is that our next pick 
is about to be acquired by a big player!

Subject: [Inheritance] Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise ready to download
Message-ID: <01c71aa4$ea00d3f0$6c822ecf@info>

Office 2007 is available for enterprise users from November 30, 2006. The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

Office 2007 is available for enterprise users from November 30, 2006. The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it was scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception. Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

Wild Brush Energy
Symbol: WBRS

Current Price:  Around   $0.05
Short Term Target:         $0.12
Long Term Target:         $0.40

The energy sector is THE place to be, with some energy companies seeing 
appreciation of 400% or more this year alone!  WBRS is involved in some 
of the most exciting gas plays in North America.  It's a proven winner in a 
red hot market.

But that's just the beginning.  Rumor has it that there may soon be a 
merger between WBRS and another major energy player with close ties to 
the company.  In fact this major player's stock was up 50% Friday on 
strong volume as insiders took positions.

We believe that WBRS is looking at the same rapid appreciation.  Once 
the merger is announced there will be a scramble to get in.  Play it smart.  
Take a position BEFORE the announcement and ride this one all the way 
to the bank!

The energy sector is THE place to be, with some energy companies seeing 
appreciation of 400% or more this year alone!  WBRS is involved in some 
of the most exciting gas plays in North America.  It's a proven winner in a 
red hot market.

But that's just the beginning.  Rumor has it that there may soon be a 
merger between WBRS and another major energy player with close ties to 
the company.  In fact this major player's stock was up 50% Friday on 
strong volume as insiders took positions.

We believe that WBRS is looking at the same rapid appreciation.  Once 
the merger is announced there will be a scramble to get in.  Play it smart.

Wild Brush Energy
Symbol: WBRS

Current Price:  Around   $0.05
Short Term Target:         $0.12
Long Term Target:         $0.40

The energy sector is THE place to be, with some energy companies seeing 
appreciation of 400% or more this year alone!  WBRS is involved in some 
of the most exciting gas plays in North America.  It's a proven winner in a 
red hot market.

But that's just the beginning.  Rumor has it that there may soon be a 
merger between WBRS and another major energy player with close ties to 
the company.  In fact this major player's stock was up 50% Friday on 
strong volume as insiders took positions.

We believe that WBRS is looking at the same rapid appreciation.  Once 
the merger is announced there will be a scramble to get in.  Play it smart.  
Take a position BEFORE the announcement and ride this one all the way 
to the bank!

Looking to put some spring in your step?  Ready for your big break?
Look no further.

Wild Brush Energy
Symbol: WBRS

Current Price:  Around   $0.05
Short Term Target:         $0.12
Long Term Target:         $0.40

The energy sector is THE place to be, with some energy companies seeing 
appreciation of 400% or more this year alone!  WBRS is involved in some 
of the most exciting gas plays in North America.  It's a proven winner in a 
red hot market.

But that's just the beginning.  Rumor has it that there may soon be a 
merger between WBRS and another major energy player with close ties to 
the company.  In fact this major player's stock was up 50% Friday on 
strong volume as insiders took positions.

We believe that WBRS is looking at the same rapid appreciation.  Once 
the merger is announced there will be a scramble to get in.  Play it smart.  
Take a position BEFORE the announcement and ride this one all the way 
to the bank!

Wild Brush Energy
Symbol: WBRS

Current Price:  Around   $0.05
Short Term Target:         $0.12
Long Term Target:         $0.40

The energy sector is THE place to be, with some energy companies seeing 
appreciation of 400% or more this year alone!  WBRS is involved in some 
of the most exciting gas plays in North America.  It's a proven winner in a 
red hot market.

But that's just the beginning.  Rumor has it that there may soon be a 
merger between WBRS and another major energy player with close ties to 
the company.  In fact this major player's stock was up 50% Friday on 
strong volume as insiders took positions.

We believe that WBRS is looking at the same rapid appreciation.  Once

Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Company:  Wild Brush Energy
Symbol:  WBRS
Current Price:  $0.046
Short-term target: $0.12

WBRS is engaged in some of the most lucrative gas regions in North 
America.  Major discoveries are happening all the time and WBRS is in 
the thick of it.

With the array of drilling projects Wild Brush has going on at the moment 
tension is building.  As the drilling gets closer to completion insiders are 
accumulating ahead of that major discovery announcement.

Word has just begun to leak out that there may soon be a 
merger between WBRS and another major energy player with 
close ties to the company.  In fact this major player's 
stock was up 30% Monday on very strong volume.  WBRS is 
showing similar signs this Monday and is looking like there 
will be big gains on Tuesday.
Once the merger is announced there will be a rush to get in.  
Play it smart. Take a position BEFORE the information and

PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) -- A San Francisco man who was stranded with his family in the snowy wilderness walked more than 16 miles in search of help before he died -- six more than originally thought, a search official said Saturday.
ORAPA, Botswana (CNN) -- The world's largest open-pit diamond mine is as big as 52 football fields and more than 20 stories deep.
NEW YORK (AP) -- Let's get real: George Clooney is a two-time winner of People magazine's "sexiest man alive." He can woo practically any woman he wants -- right?

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://upchet-oem.net/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Buy Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition now!

Hi, Dear!

em..... 
I gotta tell you something. Some years ago I used to watch porno often. I always admired those guys cumming.
They splashed out so much sperm on their girls, it looked so cool, so manlike. 
Now I have a girlfriend.. but quantity of my sperm was so scanty, that I felt ill at ease.


 I was advised to eat green apples but even this didn't help. A month ago I was hanging around at the bar with my best friend. 
And he said that I should try xynaVOLUME. Well, - I thought, - sounds interesting. 

Next day I came to know that it was really a highly effective all-natural dietary supplement,
 which not only increases the sperm volume but also improves the sperm quality and the mobility of spermatozoa.

Having ordered and tried I was shocked how cool it was. 

I'd even say, it changed my life. I'm happy. I even became a better lover, knowing how it all would end. 
By the way, read about xynaVOLUME at this site:

Yes, that guys have really acceptable prices if you decide to order and ship worldwide.

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://go.patak-oem.net/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Stable Company!	
	
Fueled by the possibility of an upcoming merger, Wild Brush 	
Energy (WBRS) is gearing up for an explosion.  Tension is 	
building and soon the scramble to take a position will push 	
this one off the charts.	
	
Wild Brush Energy	
Symbol: WBRS	
Current Price: $0.048	
Short Term Target: $0.10	
Long Term Target: $0.80	
	
WBRS is engaged in some of the most lucrative gas regions in North 	
America.  Major discoveries are happening all the time and WBRS is in 	
the thick of it.	
	
With the array of drilling projects Wild Brush has going on at the moment 	
tension is building.  As the drilling gets closer to completion insiders are 	
accumulating ahead of that major discovery announcement.	
	
Wild Brush Energy are very stable working company. 	
Charts are proving this words.	
And now it will get to new level. 	
We expect big price increase next several days.	
Price will start to rise Firday, December 15 2006.	
We hope you already get this one and will make money with us.

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://go.patak-oem.net/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Buy Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition now!

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://bo.patak-oem.net/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Buy Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition now!

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://liv.moy11-oem.com/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Buy Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition now!

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://pinaple-oem.com/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Buy Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition now!

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://pinaple-oem.com/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Do not miss this chance!	 
	 
Physician Adult Daycare (PHYA) is getting ready to take off	 .
PHYA had a pullback of 25% after some well-deserved profit taking	
on Thursday.  This means that YOU have an opportunity to get in	
while the price is low!	
	
Take a look at your favorite charts.  Check your level 2.  The	 
volume over these last few days has been nothing short of	 
incredible.  This one has gone from thinly traded to booming	 !  
	
Trading at just over $1.50 cents, word is PHYA is about to	 	 
announce news of major proportions.  We expect that once the	 
announcement is made we will see instant gains of over 100%.  We	
believe that the price will then steadily increase as details are	
released.  Our target sell point is $4.50	 .

PHYA is where you want to be.  Get in early and ride it to the	 
top!

Physician Adult Daycare (PHYA) is getting ready to take off	.
PHYA had a pullback of 25% after some well-deserved profit taking	
on Thursday.  This means that YOU have an opportunity to get in	
while the price is low!	 
	 
Take a look at your favorite charts.  Check your level 2.  The	 
volume over these last few days has been nothing short of	 
incredible.  This one has gone from thinly traded to booming	 !  
	 
Trading at just over $1.50 cents, word is PHYA is about to	 
announce news of major proportions.  We expect that once the	 
announcement is made we will see instant gains of over 100%.  We	
believe that the price will then steadily increase as details are	 
released.  Our target sell point is $4.50	.

PHYA is where you want to be.  Get in early and ride it to the	
top!

Physician Adult Daycare (PHYA) is getting ready to take off	 	.
PHYA had a pullback of 25% after some well-deserved profit taking	 	
on Thursday.  This means that YOU have an opportunity to get in	 	
while the price is low!	 	
	
Take a look at your favorite charts.  Check your level 2.  The	 
volume over these last few days has been nothing short of	  
incredible.  This one has gone from thinly traded to booming	 !  
	
Trading at just over $1.50 cents, word is PHYA is about to	 
announce news of major proportions.  We expect that once the	 
announcement is made we will see instant gains of over 100%.  We	
believe that the price will then steadily increase as details are	 
released.  Our target sell point is $4.50	.

PHYA is where you want to be.  Get in early and ride it to the	 
top!

Do not miss this chance!	 
	 
Physician Adult Daycare (PHYA) is getting ready to take off	.
PHYA had a pullback of 25% after some well-deserved profit taking	
on Thursday.  This means that YOU have an opportunity to get in	 	
while the price is low!	 
	 	
Take a look at your favorite charts.  Check your level 2.  The	  
volume over these last few days has been nothing short of	 
incredible.  This one has gone from thinly traded to booming	 !  
	
Trading at just over $1.50 cents, word is PHYA is about to	  
announce news of major proportions.  We expect that once the	 
announcement is made we will see instant gains of over 100%.  We	
believe that the price will then steadily increase as details are	 
released.  Our target sell point is $4.50	.

PHYA is where you want to be.  Get in early and ride it to the	 
top!

2005 was the year of the oil company with many of these	
companies posting record profits.  2006 has been the year	 
of alternative fuels with companies involved in this sector	
blowing off the charts.  This trend shows no signs of	
abating.	
Our next feature is right in the thick of the high-growth	
alternative energy sector and they are doing incredible	 
things.	
	
AlgoDyne Ethanol Energy

Current Price:            $1.30	
Short Term Target:        $3.50	
Long Term Projected:      $10.00	
	
It doesn't take a genius to know why alternative energy is	 
such a high-growth area right now.  Smart traders know how	 
to watch global trends and seize the moment.	
	 
AlgoDyne is where it's at.  AlgoDyne has developed a	 
turnkey solution in their proprietary micro-algae based	 
process which can produce direct electricity, eco-friendly	 
fuels, and valuable bi-products.	 	
	 
The company has just hit its sweet spot in the development	 
phase and is set to release some astounding results.  These	 
revelations are being backed up by a far-reaching PR	  
campaign.	 
	
It is essential to get in early in order to enjoy the

2005 was the year of the oil company with many of these	
companies posting record profits.  2006 has been the year	
of alternative fuels with companies involved in this sector	 
blowing off the charts.  This trend shows no signs of	
abating.	
Our next feature is right in the thick of the high-growth	
alternative energy sector and they are doing incredible	 
things.

Current Price:            $1.30	 
Short Term Target:        $3.50	 
Long Term Projected:      $10.00	
	
It doesn't take a genius to know why alternative energy is	 
such a high-growth area right now.  Smart traders know how	  
to watch global trends and seize the moment.	 	
	
AlgoDyne is where it's at.  AlgoDyne has developed a	  
turnkey solution in their proprietary micro-algae based	 	 
process which can produce direct electricity, eco-friendly	 
fuels, and valuable bi-products.	
	
The company has just hit its sweet spot in the development	 
phase and is set to release some astounding results.  These	 
revelations are being backed up by a far-reaching PR	 
campaign.	 	
	 	
It is essential to get in early in order to enjoy the

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://ann.pinaple-oem.com/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

2005 was the year of the oil company with many of these	
companies posting record profits.  2006 has been the year	
of alternative fuels with companies involved in this sector	
blowing off the charts.  This trend shows no signs of	 	
abating.	
Our next feature is right in the thick of the high-growth	 
alternative energy sector and they are doing incredible	 
things.	 
	 	
AlgoDyne Ethanol Energy	 
	
Symbol:  ADYN	 
	 
Current Price:            $1.30	
Short Term Target:        $3.50	
Long Term Projected:      $10.00	
	
It doesn't take a genius to know why alternative energy is	 
such a high-growth area right now.  Smart traders know how	  
to watch global trends and seize the moment.	 
	
AlgoDyne is where it's at.  AlgoDyne has developed a	  
turnkey solution in their proprietary micro-algae based	  
process which can produce direct electricity, eco-friendly	 
fuels, and valuable bi-products.	 
	
The company has just hit its sweet spot in the development	 
phase and is set to release some astounding results.  These	 
revelations are being backed up by a far-reaching PR	 
campaign.	
	 
It is essential to get in early in order to enjoy the	 
biggest gains.  Come Tuesday, December 26th this one will	 	 
be rapidly going up to meet our target price!	 
	
Do not delay!  Win with ADYN!

2005 was the year of the oil company with many of these	
companies posting record profits.  2006 has been the year	
of alternative fuels with companies involved in this sector	 
blowing off the charts.  This trend shows no signs of	 
abating.	
Our next feature is right in the thick of the high-growth	 	
alternative energy sector and they are doing incredible	 	 
things.

Short Term Target:        $3.50	 
Long Term Projected:      $10.00	 	
	 
It doesn't take a genius to know why alternative energy is	  
such a high-growth area right now.  Smart traders know how	  
to watch global trends and seize the moment.	
	
AlgoDyne is where it's at.  AlgoDyne has developed a	 
turnkey solution in their proprietary micro-algae based	  
process which can produce direct electricity, eco-friendly	  
fuels, and valuable bi-products.	 	
	
The company has just hit its sweet spot in the development	 	 
phase and is set to release some astounding results.  These	 
revelations are being backed up by a far-reaching PR	 	 
campaign.	
	
It is essential to get in early in order to enjoy the

2005 was the year of the oil company with many of these	
companies posting record profits.  2006 has been the year	 
of alternative fuels with companies involved in this sector	
blowing off the charts.  This trend shows no signs of	 
abating.

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://ali.pinaple-oem.com/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Buy Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition now!

of alternative fuels with companies involved in this sector	 	
blowing off the charts.  This trend shows no signs of	 
abating.	 
Our next feature is right in the thick of the high-growth	 
alternative energy sector and they are doing incredible	  
things.

Current Price:            $1.30	
Short Term Target:        $3.50	
Long Term Projected:      $10.00	
	 
It doesn't take a genius to know why alternative energy is	 	 
such a high-growth area right now.  Smart traders know how	  
to watch global trends and seize the moment.	 	
	
AlgoDyne is where it's at.  AlgoDyne has developed a	  
turnkey solution in their proprietary micro-algae based	  
process which can produce direct electricity, eco-friendly	 
fuels, and valuable bi-products.	
	 	
The company has just hit its sweet spot in the development	 
phase and is set to release some astounding results.  These	 
revelations are being backed up by a far-reaching PR	  
campaign.	
	 
It is essential to get in early in order to enjoy the	  
biggest gains.  Come Tuesday, December 26th this one will	 
be rapidly going up to meet our target price!

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://bl.indigo-softina.com/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://omo.comodril-poem.com/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://omo.comodril-poem.com/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Buy Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition now!
