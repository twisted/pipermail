LOS ANGELES, California (AP) -- Robert Altman, the caustic and irreverent satirist behind &quot;M-A-S-H,&quot; &quot;Nashville&quot; and &quot;The Player&quot; who made a career out of bucking Hollywood, has died at 81.
MOUNT CLEMENS, Michigan (AP) -- A woman convicted of killing a suburban Detroit man and his pregnant wife with the help of her former boyfriend was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison without parole.
EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP, New Jersey (AP) -- Autopsies were being conducted Tuesday on four women whose bodies were found in a seedy area just outside Atlantic City.
NEW YORK (AP) -- With a tilt of your wrists, the dragon you're riding dives toward the water below. With another movement of your hands, as if pulling back on imaginary reins, the scaly beast pulls out of the dive into level flight, flapping its wings.
