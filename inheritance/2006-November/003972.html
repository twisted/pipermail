<PRE>Software, Music and Sex are good, when they are free When the going gets tough, the tough get going A loaded wagon makes no noise Variant for slow risers: The early worm gets eaten by the birds Home is where the heart is
Nature, time, and patience are three great physicians Variant: A bird in the hand makes it hard to blow your nose Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will break my spirit
Knowledge is power You'll always miss 100% of the [basketball] shots you don't take From the Latin, de gustibus non est disputandum No pain, no gain
Doubt is the beginning, not the end, of wisdom You need to bait the hook to catch the fish Alternative: Red sky at night: sailor's' delight Red sky in the morn: sailor's be warned Love blinds, but who needs eyes to see clearly - John Parry Alternative: Red sky at night: sailor's delight Red sky in the morning: sailor take warning The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak
People who live in glass houses shouldn't play golf From the Robert Frost poem 'Mending Wall' Birds of a feather flock together Don't cut off your nose to spite your face
It takes two to make a quarrel The third time someone tries to put a saddle on you, you should admit you're a horse Nothing ventured, nothing gained If mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy No pain, no gay
