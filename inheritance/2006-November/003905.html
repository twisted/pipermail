<PRE>Possible Interpretation: Not everything is what it appears to be. Not worth ! you wont get. Make yourself worthy. (Manu MR) Play on 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away' A creaking door hangs longest. and A creaking gate hangs long. You can lead (take) a horse to water but you can't make it drink.
This too, shall pass. Why have a dog and bark yourself? Meaning: Kind words/actions are more effective in bringing about an outcome than harsh ones.
Variant: Ornithological specimen of corresponding plumage congregate gregariously Don't put the cart before the horse. Knock and the door will be opened unto you. --Matthew 7:7 It's a good horse that never stumbles.
Hey is for horses. Meaner than a junk-yard dog. Why have a dog and bark yourself? Variant: Always look on the bright side of life Paraphrased from The Mourning Bride, act i, scene i, by William Congreve. There's always a deep breath before a plunge.
If you keep your mouth shut, you won't put your foot in it. Beauty is only skin deep, but ugliness goes straight to the bone. New brooms sweep clear. &gt;From Occam's Razor where the simplest explanation is the most likely.
The best things in life are free. Never put off till (until) tomorrow what you can do today. The third time someone tries to put a saddle on you, you should admit you're a horse. It's not the size of the boat. The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
