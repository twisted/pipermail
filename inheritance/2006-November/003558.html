<PRE>What's the first rule of investing?  Buy low sell high!  
Yesterday, market forces caused our top pick (EGLY) to close 
down on the day.  This gives our members the perfect 
opportunity to pick some up on the cheap before the big 
press release! 

Ever-Glory International (EGLY)

Projected: 1.30
Rating: 5/5
Here's the latest news:

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA-(MARKET WIRE)-Nov 6, 2006 - 9:45am-
The Relationship between Ever-Glory and Disney's Agent is 
going well, with Orders Recorded in Excess of $100,000 for 
First Half of 2006.
We believe that having such a relationship with Disney is a 
huge window of opportunity which could lead to extremely 
large contracts.  Go EGLY!


Other news:
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA-(MARKET WIRE)-Nov 1, 2006 10:16pm-

specializing in garment manufacturing and exports, has 
expanded the scope of its business in 2006, wherein the first

Please check all these figures with your favorite source.  
EGLY is the real deal!  We are expecting third quarter 
numbers to be out soon and are telling all of our members to 
take a position in before the data hits the street.  These 
fortuitous figures are going to shock the market and send 
this one way up!
Give yourself the chance to come out WAY ahead here.
