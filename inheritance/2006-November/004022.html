<PRE>Alternative: Who shall guard the guards themselves? Possible Interpretation: He will talk about consequences more than act Why worry? If you worry - you die If you don't worry - you'll still die So why worry? It never rains, but it pours There's no place like home
Forewarned is forearmed There ain't no such thing as a free lunch He that knows does not speak, He that speaks does not know
There's no arguing with the barrel of a gun Liquor before beer and you're in the clear Beer before liquor and you'll never be sicker Alternate: If something is worth doing, someone will have already done it Hey is for horses
