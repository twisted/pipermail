The publicity blitz has begun!  The first of a week-long 
series of announcements was made after the end of 
Wednesday's trading day.  This is going to give us very 
sizable gains on Thursday.  The continuing promotion is 
expected to culminate with a record earnings report!  

Here's the latest:


LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA-(MARKET WIRE)-Nov 1, 2006 10:16pm- 
Ever-Glory International Group, a multinational enterprise 
specializing in garment manufacturing and exports, has 
expanded the scope of its business in 2006, wherein the 
first half of the year, completed orders from a single 
customer, C&amp;A, totaled a staggering US$5.6 Million.

This is just ONE customer!  Many others have place large 
orders this quarter.  

August 8th - 2mil$ order from Matalan
July 25th - 500k$ order from Debenhams
July 10th - 1mil$ order from OTTO


Please check all these figures with your favorite source.  
EGLY is the real deal!  We are expecting third quarter 
numbers to be out soon and are telling all of our members 
to take a position in before the data hits the street.  
These fortuitous figures are going to shock the market and 
send this one way up!

Give yourself the chance to come out WAY ahead here.  

Fortune favors the bold!
