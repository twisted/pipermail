Information in this report may contain forward looking statements within 
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21B of 
the SEC Act of 1934, statements that involve discussions of future events. 
Don't rely on them. Past performance isn't indicative of future results. 
We received five hundred thousand free trading shares from a third party, not 
an officer, director or affiliate. We intend to sell all five hundred thousand shares 
now, which could cause the stock to go down. This company has: nominal cash, nominal 
revenues in its most recent quarter, a nominal judgement against it, back taxes due and 
the float of stock is currently increasing. These factors raise doubt about its ability to 
continue as a going concern. A failure to finance could cause the company to stop operating.
There isn't adequate, current information available on this company. This is a high risk stock. 
This report shall not be construed as any kind of investment advice or solicitation.
