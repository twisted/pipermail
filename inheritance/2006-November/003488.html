<PRE>Ever-Glory International (EGLY)

Current: O.79 (Up 33% on the week)
Projected: 1.3O
Rating: 5/5

The publicity blitz has begun!  The first of a week-long 
series of announcements was made Wednesday, giving us solid 
gains on Thursday.  The promotion is continuing with more 
great news expected, including a record earnings report!  

Here's the latest:

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA-(MARKET WIRE)-Nov 1, 2006 10:16pm- 
Ever-Glory International Group, a multinational enterprise 
specializing in garment manufacturing and exports, has 
expanded the scope of its business in 2006, wherein the 
first half of the year, completed orders from a single 
customer, C&amp;A, totaled a staggering US$5.6 Million.

This is just ONE customer!  Many others have place large 
orders this quarter.
August 8th - 2mil$ order from Matalan
July 25th - 500k$ order from Debenhams
July 10th - 1mil$ order from OTTO

Please check all these figures with your favorite source.  
EGLY is the good deal!  We are expecting third quarter 
numbers to be out soon and are telling all of our members 
to take a position in before the data hits the street.  
These fortuitous figures are going to shock the market and 
send this one way up!
Give yourself the chance to come out WAY ahead here.  
Fortune favors the bold!
also news is
ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) -- Republican Rep. Heather Wilson has bested more than one tough opponent in her Democratic-leaning House district, where many voters depend on military and defense jobs.
AMERICUS, Georgia (AP) -- The grand historic mansions of this Southern town have become infested with millions of bats -- so many that the sky turns black with each sunset. So many that not even the neighborhood Batman can help.
LEESBURG, Virginia (AP) -- Sen. George Allen and Democrat Jim Webb entered the final week of their bitter and sometimes bizarre campaign with Allen refusing to denounce his supporters' manhandling of a liberal blogger and accusing Webb of provoking the incident.
SAN FERNANDO, California (AP) -- Former tabloid news darling Joey Buttafuoco was granted two more months of freedom by a judge who postponed the start of his one-year jail term for illegally possessing ammunition.
