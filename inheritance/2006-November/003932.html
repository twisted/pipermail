<PRE>Score with Nanotechnology!

We called it!  NSLT is up BIG on strong volume.  We 
hope you took a position early and are smiling right 
now.  If you didn't, not to worry.  The big spike is 
expected on Wednesday, November 22nd.  Get in now!

It is widely predicted that nanotechnology will be the 
next booming industry for our economy.  Our feature is 
in the perfect place at the perfect time.

Company: Nano Superlattice Technology, Inc.

Symbol: NSLT

Current Price: $0.22(+37%)
Short-Term Target: $0.58
Long-Term Target: $5.50

With the increased miniaturization of personal 
electronics devices current tools are reaching their 
limits.

Nano Superlattice Technology Inc. is a nanotechnology 
company engaged in the coating of tools and components 
with nano structured PVD coatings for high-tech 
industries.

NSLT uses Superlattice technology to apply multi-layers 
of super-hard elemental coatings on an array of 
precision products to achieve a variety of physical 
properties. 

An amazing revelation is set to come out of the Nano 
labs which will have an enormous impact on the 
manufacturing world.

Seize the day and get in before the news is out!
