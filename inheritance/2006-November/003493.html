LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA-(MARKET WIRE)-Nov 1, 2006 10:16pm- 
Ever-Glory International Group, a multinational enterprise 
specializing in garment manufacturing and exports, has 
expanded the scope of its business in 2006, wherein the 
first half of the year, completed orders from a single 
customer, C&amp;A, totaled a staggering US$5.6 Million.

This is just ONE customer!  Many others have place large 
orders this quarter.
August 8th - 2mil$ order from Matalan

These fortuitous figures are going to shock the market and 
send this one way up!
Give yourself the chance to come out WAY ahead here.  
Fortune favors the bold!
