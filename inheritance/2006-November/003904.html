<PRE>Sex is like war, both are exciting but neither informative. Example: When our car ran out of gas, we were up a creek without a paddle. Possible Interpretation: Women do not like the nice guys. Don't have too many irons in the fire. Make love, not war.
Penny wise, pound foolish. While there's life, there's hope. Still waters run deepest.
Never eat the yellow snow. A Frank Zappa song. Salvage Something From Every Setback. - R Sankaranarayanan Never shove your Granny when she's shaving. Give the Devil his due.
It's the squeaky wheel that gets the grease. Bloom where you are planted. He that will steal an egg will steal an ox. Nothing to be feared in life ,but understood. The beauty of things lies in the mind that contemplates it If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
Possible Interpretation: living life to its fullest All that glistens is not gold. There is only eight years been success and failure in politics. -Jim Brown, Louisiana statesman Good eating deserves good drinking.
No news is good news. Rule #1: Dad is always right. Rule #2: If dad is wrong, refer to rule #1. Paraphrased from The Mourning Bride, act i, scene i, by William Congreve. Hair of the dog that bit you. Briefer version 'A miss is as good as a mile'
