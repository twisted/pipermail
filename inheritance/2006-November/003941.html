LOS ANGELES, California (AP) -- Robert Altman, the caustic and irreverent satirist behind &quot;M-A-S-H,&quot; &quot;Nashville&quot; and &quot;The Player&quot; who made a career out of bucking Hollywood, has died at 81.
(CNN) -- Although Congress is unlikely to follow calls from a top Democrat to bring back the military draft, the United States does have a plan, if necessary, aimed at inducting millions of young men for service.
NEW YORK (Reuters) -- Internet media company Yahoo said on Monday it has agreed to have at least seven newspaper groups use its technology to sell advertising on their Internet sites.
