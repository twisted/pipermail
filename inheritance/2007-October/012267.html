<PRE>Hello Scott, 
 
Ron Paul is for the people, unless you want your children to 
have human implant RFID chips, a National ID card and create 
a North American Union and see an economic collapse far worse  
than the great depression. Vote for Ron Paul he speaks the  
truth and the media and government is afraid of him. This is 
the last honest politican left to bring this country out of 
this rut from the War Profiteers and bush Administration has 
created. Get motivated America, don't believe the lies of the 
media he has also WON the GOP Debate On Sunday! Value Freedom 
and Liberty instead of corporate lies and corruption. Bypass  
this media blackout they are doing to Ron Paul, tell your family  
and friends and get involved in a local group at meetup.com make  
your voice heard! He will end the War In Iraq immediately,  
He will eliminate the IRS and wasteful government spending, and  
eliminate the Federal Reserve and restore power to the people  
and the only person not a member on the CFR. Can any other runner  
make these claims or give Americans the true freedom we were all 
raised to believe? We are all economic slaves to the banks and the 
illegal federal Reserve. This is why our currency is worth nothing 
because of Hidden Inflation Tax and the IRS taking everything 
you make! 
 
** RON PAUL WILL STOP THE IRAQ WAR IMMEDIATELY! ** 
 
He has NEVER voted: 
* to raise taxes 
* for an unbalanced budget 
* to raise congressional pay 
* for a federal restriction on gun ownership 
* to increase the power of the executive branch 
 
He HAS voted: 
* against the Iraq war 
* against the inappropriately named USA PATRIOT act 
* against regulating the internet 
* against the Military Commissions Act 
 
He will eliminate the IRS, Wasteful Government Spending &amp;  
Stop The Iraq War Immediately! 
 
Most importantly, he voted NO on anything in Congress that  
is not allowed by the Constitution. And he Despises any 
politican that does not do their job for the people and lives 
up to the constitution!  
 
Google.com &amp; Youtube.com Search: &quot;Ron Paul&quot; 
Join The Revolution! 
 
*************************************** 
We Need A Real President That Will Restore And Protect 
Americans! Stop The War! Protect Our Borders! 
*********VOTE RON PAUL 2008************
