New Fee Structure Generates Huge Response.

Exit Only Inc. E.X.T.O.
$0.41

Exit Only first hit the market in Canada back in May of this year. The
idea of bringing new and used vehicles to web consumers is nothing we
have not seen before. However, allowing sellers to post there vehicles
at no charge and no hidden fees, is new. Now sellers are only paying for
the contact information of actual interested buyers, and at only $2 per
lead.

Points Of Interest:

- Initial marketing in Canada was met with overwhelming response.
- The marketing teams projected year end numbers were surpassed 4 months
early.
- the US expansion is tested and ready for immediate launch.
- Exit has partnering with several high volume web services to provide
fast market exposure.
- In addition the site is now providing Mobile access, delivering
sellers contact information of potential buyers right to their cell
phone.

The US market literally dwarfs the Canadian vehicle market, making the
potential for this site astronomical. For more information on Exit Only
Inc. contact your financial websites.

Rice touts 'most serious' Mideast peace efforts in years ----- RAMALLAH,
West Bank -- Israel and Palestinian negotiators are involved in the most
serious effort in &quot;many, many years&quot; to try to end the Mideast conflict,
said U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on Monday. U.S. Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice meets Monday with Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas. &quot;Frankly, it's time for the establishment of a
Palestinian state and it's time for Israel to live in the security that
is going to come with a peaceful and democratic neighbor,&quot; Rice said. A
day after meeting with Israeli leaders, Rice met in the West Bank with
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and said she's pushing both sides to
work &quot;intensely&quot; toward agreeing on a &quot;serious, substantive and
concrete&quot; framework for a November peace conference in Annapolis,
Maryland.

News Articles From The US:

Students Suspended For Playing 'Choking Game'-------- CINCINNATI -- Five
students at Northwest High School have been suspended for playing a
potentially deadly game. School officials declined comment, but it has
been discovered that the students are on a 10-day suspension after one
student choked four others in gym class. .To think that someone would
actually choke your child into unconsciousness during school hours, on
school property (and) supervised by a teacher is absolutely unreal,.
said Amanda Diel, whose daughter was involved in the incident.
