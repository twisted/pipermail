<PRE>Forget about your partner faking her orgasm or not being able to please her=
. You will be able to penetrate deeper so your partner will experience more=
 pleasure as well as multiple orgasms during sexual intercourse. You can al=
so forget about losing your erection in the middle of sexual intercourse, a=
s Vpxl will keep it strong and firm. You will have stronger ejaculations th=
at bring you greater orgasms. Women view men with a larger penis size as be=
ing more sexually attractive and sexually capable. An overall larger penis =
size also means a larger surface area, which stimulates more nerve endings,=
 resulting in a more pleasurable experience for both you and your partner. =
A larger and more muscular penis is also more of a natural, visual turn on =
for women.
<A HREF="http://poloewar.com">http://poloewar.com</A>
When you are sexually aroused, your brain releases a hormone causing blood =
to enter the penis and fill your erectile tissue (Corpora Cavernosa). The c=
ells in the Corpora Cavernosa are filled with blood until an erection is ac=
hieved. You can have a BIGGER PENIS!
