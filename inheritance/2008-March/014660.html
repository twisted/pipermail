<PRE>Hello, 

Thank you for your interest in our offer! Keep in mind that this offer is for US and Canadian citizens only!  
Our company name is DT-System, Inc.
We are Lithuanian company, we are located in Lithuania. It&#146;s next to Europe. We take up software 
and design development. At the present moment we have the vacancy of courier in our company. 
The matter is that some our agents sometimes are in their business trips in the USA 
and make orders in e-shops but unfortunately they can't ship out these packages to their 
native countries as they are not US citizens. That's why we need your services. 
You'll have to receive the packages to your address and then ship them out to the 
destination point via US postal service. So to start cooperating with our company you 
should provide with your address to which you could receive the packages. As soon as we 
have received your information via email we'll give you the detailed instructions. 
If you're really interested in our job position please provide with the following data:

- full name
- address
- regular phone number

Attention!  Please don't reply to this email. 
Send out the data to the email of our personnel manager: <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/inheritance">tpettit66 at yahoo.com</A>


Best regards,
HR manager
Jonas Varnas
