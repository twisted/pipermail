Carbon Race Corporation to Introduce Carbon Fiber Competition and 
Junior Class Race/Recreational Kart Designs at Kart Expo International
Thursday February 22, 8:00 am ET 


CHICAGO, IL--(MARKET WIRE)--Feb 22, 2007 -- Carbon Race Corporation 
(Other OTC:CBRJ.PK - News) will introduce two new Karts, MKI Competition 
and MKI Junior, at the Kart Expo(TM) International, North America's Largest
 Kart Show, to be held at the Renaissance Schaumburg Hotel and Convention 
Center, Schaumburg, IL, February 24-25. Carbon Race's MKI Kart is the 
industry's first full monocoque chassis manufactured with advanced 
composite/carbon fiber technology, and has been engineered using wind 
tunnel testing for greater aerodynamics and Formula 1-like ground effects.
Carbon Race has introduced Formula Car technology -- monocoque hulls, 
carbon fiber composites, and wind tunnel testing -- into products for 
a much wider Motorsports market. The MKI Junior Kart is designed for 
competitive youth racing, where numerous pro drivers started, and will 
be an exceptional step-up recreational Kart. The MKI Competition Kart 
is widely used for racing by the very experienced driver. Other race 
and recreational products are with the Carbon Race design and engineering 
teams now.
 
 
&quot;Our customers are interested in innovation, engineering supremacy, 
style and performance. The importance of such product development 
and manufacturing for the worldwide market can't be overstated. 
With our new design and engineering innovation, we are positioning 
the company to excel in the marketplace. These products tend to sell
faster and will generate increased profits,&quot; 
commented Lynnette Knafelc, CEO of CBRJ.
