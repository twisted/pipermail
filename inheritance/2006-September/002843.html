<PRE>Fellow Investor, BIG NEWS ARE HITTING ON THURSDAY FOR CRSVF!!!

      Last Friday BREAKING NEWS RELEASED ON CRSVF!!!

  DON'T MISS THIS INVESTMENT MOMENT, PLACE CRSVF ON THE RADAR!!!

Get ready for a volatile 2nd half of 2006 - one where the Bulls and
Bears will BOTH be proved wrong. But odds are, we'll see another
year where the market indexes bounce around a lot without really
going anywhere. And we'll also see certain sectors - favored at
this point in the economic cycle - SOAR...


Own the right stocks, in the right space, and you could reap a
handful of money-doublers. But if you own the wrong investment, you
could easly lose 25%-35% or more!

Here is my Favorite Pick for the second half of 2006: CRSVF
