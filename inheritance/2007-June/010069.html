<PRE>SREA Takes Investors For Second Climb! UP 40%.

Score One Inc. (SREA)
$0.42 UP 40%

SREA continues another huge climb this week after hot news was released
Friday. BusinessNewsNow.us has released SREA as featured StockWatch.
This one is still cooking. Go read the news and get on SREA Tuesday!

The vocals are heartfelt, really pretty and to a nice musical and
rhythmical backdrop. It's so easy to get lost in this song when you hear
it.

I'm a bit disappointed by my position - I thought I'd be higher.
Watch this movie - eat popcorn, have a good evening.

Sit back and enjoy the ride on this one.

I cannot stand the concept of ads on something I paid for - but worse to
lock the disc so you can't escape it. I'm thinking this would be
excellent for robotics, installation art, making a artistic computers,
and comically misplacing. Even better there's a nice whistling line
you're going to find it hard to forget, and not to imitate! These tiny
little guys provide decent processing power, battery life, and a whole
host of opportunities for you. I'm a bit disappointed by my position - I
thought I'd be higher. they're all likable and dis-likable! Nothing gets
people motivated to exercise like seeing their position on the board
slip as others get out there and work up a sweat!
