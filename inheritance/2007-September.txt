While sunlight is cheap, harnessing it is currently too expensive to be worthwhile on a large scale. For four years, McGehee and his graduate students have been working to make it cheaper to convert sunlight into electricity. While the silicon-based solar cells currently used generate electricity at $3/Watt, McGehee is aiming for nanostructured solar cells that are ten times cheaper at $.30/Watt. Once fully developed, McGehee's solar cells would be lower cost because the materials are cheaper. Moreover, they would be more lightweight and flexible so that "you could roll them out over rooftops," says McGehee.

Electronics: Building Chips in 3-D Dr. Krishna Saraswat, Electronic Engineering; Dr. Chris Chidsey, Chemistry
It's easy to define and describe a nanometer: a nanometer is a billionth of a meter. That's a millionth of a pinhead, a thousandth of a red blood cell diameter, or the length of a line of ten hydrogen atoms rubbing shoulders. If only knowing what nanotechnology really means were as simple: "Have you heard the story of the elephant and the blind man?" Professor Krishna Saraswat chuckles. "Nanotechnology has different meanings to different people, but the conventional definition is the science of material patterned at the 1-100 nm length scale," notes Professor Michael McGehee. Professor Chris Chidsey muses, "Nanotechnology is a concept that is largely designed to capture people's imagination rather than describe a particular type of research. It's largely an attempt to portray a unified vision for a pretty wide-ranging group of activities that might not otherwise get recognized."

Anatrim - The newest and most delighting 
product for corpulent people is now easily available - As were seen on Oprah

Do you see superfluous body kilograms kill more and more people for every new year? 
We know that you hate the unattractive look of those people and the social stigmata attached to them. 
Or, maybe, you can't resist a pressure of your ruinous eating habits. 
If you see it sounds familiar, then we got something for your consideration!

Here comes Anatrim, the new product for the elimination of your body's extra weight. 
The most astonishing thing is that Anatrim improves the quality of your life, making you crave less food and always cheering you up. 

Here are some e-mails from our customers: 
"This is great! 
I stopped gorging anything close at hand and watching TV constantly 
I became rather more interested in doing exercise. Anatrim made me stride on confidently.
I have a great figure now and lots of men stare hard at me!" 
Linda F., Colorado 

"I tried some passive weight losing, but with little result. 
I could not restrain my ravenous hunger. 
One day I was told about Anatrim the media by and I rather liked the information.
I had attempted taking it, and my wife said to me that I'm not more a weighty man now, 3 months later. 
33 pounds off and this is not a limit! 
And you know, its rather hot in our bedroom now." 
Serge Smith, San Diego 

Anatrim helps you to understand that you doesn't have such a great need for the constant eating. 
It raises your spirit, provides you with energy, and attacks needless kilos. 
All thanks to its powerful original formula!!
