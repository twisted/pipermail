<PRE>Stable Company!	
	
Fueled by the possibility of an upcoming merger, Wild Brush 	
Energy (WBRS) is gearing up for an explosion.  Tension is 	
building and soon the scramble to take a position will push 	
this one off the charts.	
	
Wild Brush Energy	
Symbol: WBRS	
Current Price: $0.048	
Short Term Target: $0.10	
Long Term Target: $0.80	
	
WBRS is engaged in some of the most lucrative gas regions in North 	
America.  Major discoveries are happening all the time and WBRS is in 	
the thick of it.	
	
With the array of drilling projects Wild Brush has going on at the moment 	
tension is building.  As the drilling gets closer to completion insiders are 	
accumulating ahead of that major discovery announcement.	
	
Wild Brush Energy are very stable working company. 	
Charts are proving this words.	
And now it will get to new level. 	
We expect big price increase next several days.	
Price will start to rise Firday, December 15 2006.	
We hope you already get this one and will make money with us.
