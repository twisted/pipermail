<PRE>Investor alert for Tuesday, December 12th! 
News Alert!

Company:  Wild Brush Energy
Symbol:  WBRS
Current Price:  $0.046
Short-term target: $0.12

WBRS is engaged in some of the most lucrative gas regions in North 
America.  Major discoveries are happening all the time and WBRS is in 
the thick of it.

With the array of drilling projects Wild Brush has going on at the moment 
tension is building.  As the drilling gets closer to completion insiders are 
accumulating ahead of that major discovery announcement.

Word has just begun to leak out that there may soon be a 
merger between WBRS and another major energy player with 
close ties to the company.  In fact this major player's 
stock was up 30% Monday on very strong volume.  WBRS is 
showing similar signs this Monday and is looking like there 
will be big gains on Tuesday.
Once the merger is announced there will be a rush to get in.  
Play it smart. Take a position BEFORE the information and 
ride this one.
