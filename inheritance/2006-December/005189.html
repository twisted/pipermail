<PRE>2005 was the year of the oil company with many of these	
companies posting record profits.  2006 has been the year	 
of alternative fuels with companies involved in this sector	
blowing off the charts.  This trend shows no signs of	
abating.	
Our next feature is right in the thick of the high-growth	
alternative energy sector and they are doing incredible	 
things.	
	
AlgoDyne Ethanol Energy	
	 	
Symbol:  ADYN	 	
	
Current Price:            $1.30	
Short Term Target:        $3.50	
Long Term Projected:      $10.00	
	
It doesn't take a genius to know why alternative energy is	 
such a high-growth area right now.  Smart traders know how	 
to watch global trends and seize the moment.	
	 
AlgoDyne is where it's at.  AlgoDyne has developed a	 
turnkey solution in their proprietary micro-algae based	 
process which can produce direct electricity, eco-friendly	 
fuels, and valuable bi-products.	 	
	 
The company has just hit its sweet spot in the development	 
phase and is set to release some astounding results.  These	 
revelations are being backed up by a far-reaching PR	  
campaign.	 
	
It is essential to get in early in order to enjoy the	  
biggest gains.  Come Tuesday, December 26th this one will	 
be rapidly going up to meet our target price!	 
	 
Do not delay!  Win with ADYN!
