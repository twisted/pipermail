<PRE>Possible Interpretation: All style and no substance Variant attributed to Hugh Hefner: &quot;No nudes is bad nudes&quot; All hat and no cattle Every dog has his day Anonymous The third time someone tries to put a saddle on you, you should admit you're a horse
When in Rome do as the Romans do (or more, commonly, just When in Rome) Whiskey on beer, never fear Beer on whiskey, mighty risky A loaded wagon makes no noise
Home is where the heart is Friedrich Nietzsche, The Twilight of the Idols (1888) All sizzle and no steak Possible Interpretation: A need kept a secret will never be addressed
Variant: Ask and ye shall receive To err is human; to forgive is divine (Pope, Essay on Criticism) Kill two birds with one stone To kill two birds with one stone Those who lost dreaming are lost Possible Interpretation: Those that are helped are not the best
All roads lead to Rome There's more than one way to skin a cat Possible Interpretation: Everybody needs other people He who dies with the most toys is nevertheless still dead
Many a mickle makes a muckle No pain, no gay Alternate: If at first you don't succeed, perhaps skydiving is not for you Treat them mean, keep them keen Interpretation: A person who is active will not grow stale
