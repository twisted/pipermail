<PRE>You cannot make big returns on an oil company AFTER huge
profits are reported.  You also can't make them by getting 
in AFTER successful drilling results.  Everyone needs a 
helping hand at getting in BEFORE the big events, and 
that's what we are giving you here.

Great product, great sector, tightly held, with great 
results expected any day.  Cana Petroleum is going to make 
you a winner!

Symbol: CNPM
Current Price: Around  $0.78 
Projected Price:       $5.40

Watch it on Tuesday, December 5th.  This one is going to 
have you wearing a big smile all day long!  

Major oil discovery?  We are not permitted to say at this 
point.  All we can say is that this one is going to see 
amazing appreciation in a very short period of time!  This 
is your opportunity.  Excel with CNPM!
