<PRE> This could be your big break!	
	
This tightly held issue is in a booming sector and has just 	
begun a PR blitz that is starting to have everyone talking 	
about it and rushing to get in.  When interest like this is 	
generated there is only one way to go and that's UP!	
	
Physicians Adult Daycare, Inc.	
	
Symbol: PHYA	
Current Price:                $2.23	
Short-Term Projected Price:   $4.25	
Long-Term Target Price:       $10.20	
	
As the population ages, the economic value in the US market 	
for adult daycare is projected to grow nearly 600%.  	
Globally the potential market is a staggering $45 billion.	
	
PHYA is right there to take flight in this red hot sector.  	
Check the recent news:	
	
12/12 - Physicians Adult Daycare, Inc. Enters Into 	
Negotiations to Acquire 36 Adult Daycare Centers	
	
12/14 - Physicians Adult Daycare, Inc. Announces Good News 	
for &quot;Baby-Boomers	
	
And just yesterday:	
	
12-19 - Physicians Adult Daycare, Inc. Enters Negotiations 	
With Las Vegas Hotels to Accommodate Employees With Adult 	
Daycare Needs	
	
With such big negotiations going on we are looking forward 	
to some incredible announcements.  	
	
The time is now.  We called it last week at $1.50  Now at 	
$2.23 there is still plenty of room to run!	
	
Don't let this one pass you buy.  Do yourself a favor and 	
get in on this big break.  More exciting news to come!	\
