Dear Friend,

I am Barrister Babbacar Diallo, a solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney to Mr. Patrick Hayes a Citizen of your country, who used to work with Total Development
Company here in Dakar Senegal. On the 21st of April 2002, my client, his wife and their only son were involved in a car accident along sagbama express road.
All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost there lives.Since then I have made several enquiries to the embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives which has
proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last name over the Internet to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you.
I have contacted you to assist in Transfering the Assets and Capitals, valued at US$10.5million left behind by my Client before they get confisicated or declared unserviceable by the Security Finance Company where this Asset is lodged. 
The said Security Finance Company which is located in Europe,has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confisicated.
Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over a year now, I seek the consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased since you are of the same Nationality, so that the asset of my client can be transfered to your account.
On receipt of your positive response, we shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities for transfer.
I have all necessary legal documents required for the claim. All I need from you is your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me through this email: babbadiallo@post.cz  or call me on +221-5144136 for more details.
Best regards,
BARRISTER BABBACAR DIALLO
