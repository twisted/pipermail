Electronics: Building Chips in 3-D Dr. Krishna Saraswat, Electronic Engineering; Dr. Chris Chidsey, Chemistry
It's easy to define and describe a nanometer: a nanometer is a billionth of a meter. That's a millionth of a pinhead, a thousandth of a red blood cell diameter, or the length of a line of ten hydrogen atoms rubbing shoulders. If only knowing what nanotechnology really means were as simple: &quot;Have you heard the story of the elephant and the blind man?&quot; Professor Krishna Saraswat chuckles. &quot;Nanotechnology has different meanings to different people, but the conventional definition is the science of material patterned at the 1-100 nm length scale,&quot; notes Professor Michael McGehee. Professor Chris Chidsey muses, &quot;Nanotechnology is a concept that is largely designed to capture people's imagination rather than describe a particular type of research. It's largely an attempt to portray a unified vision for a pretty wide-ranging group of activities that might not otherwise get recognized.&quot;
