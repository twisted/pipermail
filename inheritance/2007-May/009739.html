He has also completed various post-graduate classes at Art Center
College of Design, the University of California at Los Angeles, and Otis
Art Institute in Los Angeles. In 1997 I was invited to join the
exhibition &quot;Symbols Of The 21st Century&quot; held by the Museum of Post and
Communication in Berlin. Due to the modular method I use to build
compositions and the possibility that combined motifs can be, in turn,
recycled the complexity of my work grows exponentially over a constant
time. Estrangement compels the surprise necessary to finish a picture.
Presently he lives in Calgary. Enlargable upon request.
I've been Painting for 2 yrs. All at deep discounts.
Artist has numerous paintings in private and corporate as well as
various Native American museum collections throughout the world.
Sold as a pair with Rightey. I completed my largest Mail Art piece
(13x7ft) for this exhibit.
As artists our creations can absorb this energy from our enthusiasm and
concentration on the act of creation. There has always been black and
white in magic and so it is with science and technology.
Eric deliberately made this film as a silent comedy as a tip of his hat
to his heroes Buster Keaton and Laurel and Hardy. A visual tension is
born, as glimpses of a &quot;photographic reality&quot; slip in and out of view,
toying with what is known, perhaps reminiscent of a dream, a place of
timelessness.
Born and raised in Los Angeles, he established a name for himself as an
illustrator and animator.
As artists our creations can absorb this energy from our enthusiasm and
concentration on the act of creation.
The compositions are from nature in form and earthy in colour. Contact
us now to boost your image and to take advantage of our special offers!
Rose has exhibited her work in England, Germany, South Africa, Lesotho
and Mozambique. I use acrylics with the stencil technique on board or
other mediums. You will see flow and movement in my works and I aim to
draw the eye in, around and back out again. Send in Your JPG photo and
description, and get af professional apprisal all for free. Women are my
main focus of my art,  because, to me, there is nothing more beautiful
than the female form.
To understand her subject she likes to see it's habitat. This I approach
within the context of seeking a more ambient rich and harmonious
exhibition space. Don't be hasty in your judgment I ask. Christine's art
is available in many galleries across Canada and the United States.
He has also completed various post-graduate classes at Art Center
College of Design, the University of California at Los Angeles, and Otis
Art Institute in Los Angeles.
He was greatly influenced by Tom Thompson, the &quot;French Impressionists&quot;
and &quot;The Fauves&quot;.
My subjects include figuratives, landscapes, fantasies, animals,
(especially, horses), etc. 1993 Potere Ciclopico &quot;Cyclopean Power&quot;. Very
fashionable and extremely popular.
He has been painting full-time for more than 30 years.
With a sarcastic wit, he welcomes  all comments, from the insightful to
the absurd. We also specialize in works of the Photo-Secession and the
circle of Stieglitz.
