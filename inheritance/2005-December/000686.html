<PRE>MICRO-CAP VALUES

Are you up 430% this year? 

Ticker Symbol: LBWR (Labwire, Inc.)

Micro-caps with great earnings potential, new ideas &amp; technologies that will put them ahead of the big boys and make them tomorrow's industry leaders today.  Here is your chance to get in on the ground floor.

Labwire (Symbol: LBWR) is one such company.

In brief:
* LBWR has taken its revenues from 0 to 3 million almost overnight.
* LBWR is now in the Top 10 in Revenue out of 700+ companies in the industry.
* LBWR is projected to grow to 12 million in revenue by next year.
* LBWR projects it will achieve 50 million in 3 years with approximately 15 million in earnings.
* LBWR is positioned to achieve a run rate of 3,200,000 dollars.
* LBWR has a Revenue/employee ratio of 700k/employee, compared to the industry average of 200k/employee.
* LBWR has successfully implemented the largest DOT contract in industry history.


Here's why:
Labwire is in one of the fastest growing businesses in one of the fastest growing sectors. 3rd Quarter recordings yield the highest number of monthly transactions since the company's inception. During September, the Labwire Platform processed the most drug tests ever, positioning the company to achieve a run rate of 3,200,000 dollars.

Labwire is a nationally recognized leader in complete background investigations and drug screening for major Fortune 500 companies. This industry is huge, over 5.9 billion dollars annually according to Standard and Poor's.

Labwire has taken its revenues from 0 to 3 million almost overnight. It is now in the Top 10 in Revenue out of 700+ companies in the industry. Next year the company is projected to grow to 12 million in revenue, and according to a recent press release, projects it will achieve 50 million in 3 years with approximately 15 million in earnings.

Now THAT is growth--that's a 20-fold increase in revenues. IMAGINE a 20-fold increase at the ticker.

How is Labwire increasing revenues so fast?

Labwire is signing contract after contract, including the largest ever testing contract in history.

Labwire brings tremendous experience to its industry. The company's software platform technology is the most advanced in its field. No other company's even comes close.

Labwire is so far ahead of its competitors that its comprehensive solution to managing employee screening services is the most efficient and cost-effective platform in the industry.  Labwire has a Revenue/Employee ratio of 700k/employee, compared to the industry average of 200k/employee.

We believe Labwire will easily become the #1 company in its industry.  If it grabbed at a minimum 5% of the total market that would be 300 million in revenues, a 100-fold increase.  Could you imagine a 100-fold increase in ticker for the coming years?

But, that's only half the story.

Labwire's bomb detection subsidiary--American K-9 Bomb Search, Inc.--is also expanding rapidly, inking contract after contract with the biggest oil and chemical refineries all along the Gulf Coast.


HERE IS THE HIDDEN GEM WALL STREET HASN'T CAUGHT ON TO YET:

U.S. chemical plants could be vulnerable to the next big terror attack.  You may remember, after 9/11, companies that could protect us in any way against terror went through the roof.  Well, when Wall Street figures out that Labwire is very instrumental in protecting these possible targets - LOOK OUT!  The stock price of Labwire could go through the roof.


UNSECURED CHEMICAL PLANTS DANGEROUSLY VULNERABLE TO TERRORISM

One of the most urgent threats to America's safety is the risk that terrorists could cause thousands, even millions, of deaths and injuries by sabotaging one or more of the 15,000 industrial chemical plants across the United States

Stephen Flynn, a former Coast Guard Commander and staff director of the bipartisan commission co-chaired by former Sens. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) and WarrenRudman (R-N.H.) that warned of terrorist threats prior to 9/11, writes about the chemicalthreat in his new book, &quot;America the Vulnerable&quot;:

The morning after the first terrorist strike on this sector, Americans will look around their neighborhoods and suddenly discover that potentially lethal chemicals are everywhere, and be aghast to learn that the U.S. governmenthas still not developed a plan to secure them. The subsequent political pressure to shut down the industry until some minimal new safeguards can be put in place - as we did with commercial aviation following the 9/11 attacks - will be overwhelming.  

There is clear evidence that terrorists are interested in chemical plant attacks. In this February 2002 congressional testimony, CIA Director George Tenet warned, &quot;Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups might &#133; try to launch conventional attacks against the chemical or nuclear industrial infrastructure of the United States to cause widespread toxic or radiological damage.&quot; 

In February 2003, the government's National Infrastructure Protection Center, then part of the FBI, warned that U.S. chemical plants were &quot;viable targets&quot; of al Qaeda terrorists bent on causing &quot;contamination, disruption, and terror.&quot; 

A study by the Army surgeon general, conducted soon after 9/11, found that up to 2.4 million people could be killed or wounded by a terrorist attack on a singlechemical plant. 

The EPA has identified 140 toxic and flammable chemicals that pose the greatest risk to human health and the environment. The agency also identified approximately 15,000 facilities that produce, use or store one or more of these chemicals in significant quantities. 

The EPA identified 123 chemical facilities where an accident or attack could threaten more than a million people and 7,605 plants that threatened more than 1,000 people. 

The bottom line:
Labwire stock could start to take off at any time and a few years from now could be 5- 8 or even higher.  Be smart and get yourself a few thousand shares and put it away for a while.
