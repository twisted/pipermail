OJ Futures Near 100 Dollars - Sun Rayz Products (SRPI) Announces Sales Brokerage Agreement - v813Zv71

You heard us right.  Here is the news we have been waiting for: TAMPA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 2005--Sun Rayz Products Inc. (SRPI:PK) announces Sales Brokerage Contract with Hughes Sales.  Hughes had sales totaling sixty-five million dollars in 2004, and is just the right team at the right time for Sun Rayz (SRPI).  And what do we mean by THE RIGHT TIME?  OJ March 2006 Futures (OJ: NYBOT) are now nearly 100 Dollars, up from just 85 in January.  Last summer's hurricanes in Florida are the main cause for the price spike, and Sun Rayz (SRPI) is launching its sales blitz at just the right time as prices are expected to climb even higher.  Michael Hughes, President & C.E.O. of Hughes Sales stated, "Initial response from our retailers has been extremely positive. We expect success selling the FLA USA 100% Valencia Orange Juice in 2005. We are excited about partnering with Sun Rayz Products, Inc. in launching this product line and brand name."  Reasons to own SRPI:

*World Reknowned Investor Jim Rogers Picks Commodites (such as OJ) as the wave of the future.  *OJ, March 2006 Futures Now Nearly 100 Dollars, UP From 85 in just January.  *SRPI signs sales contract with Hughes Sales, with 65 million in sales in 2004.  *SRPI is very thinly traded and will take off quite easily.

No, you didn't hear us qrong.  World Renowned Investor Jim Rogers Picks Commodities (such as OJ) as the wave of the future.  In an interview on the Fox News Channel with Neil Cavuto, Rogers stated that he is confident commodities will continue to rise until the year 2017.  Rogers is co-founder of the Quantum Fund, a global-investment partnership. In just 10 years, the portfolio gained more than 4000%, while the S&P rose less than 50%.
