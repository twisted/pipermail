Hi! stock holder,

We are a stock furtherance company and we can promote any variety of stocks. We have been working on US market  for 3 years. But now it is getting harder and harder to work on US market. We are looking for serious partners in Europe with whom we can make business together. That offer is for you if you have a company and you want to promote it. We encourage stocks by mass email advertising. 

Stock owner

We can increase the cost of your STOCK and we can increase average day trading range. We can increase price up to 200-255%  in 2-3 weeks and also we can increase capacity  by 10 times each trading day. You don't have to pay anything in beforehand. First we increase the cost  and the volume, then you  pay. 

Payment: Our price  for that is 10% from the daily range. We count  it by the following formula: last  price * daily volume. 

If you are concerned in our suggestion  please write me back to the following email: <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/inheritance">stockadvertis01 at yahoo.com</A>
