<PRE>Office 2007 is available for enterprise users from November 30, 2006.
The end user version is available from the beginning of 2007. The 2007
Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the
most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as
Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it was scheduled to
be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with
general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a
number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new
graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and
toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.
Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief
amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for
smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks
before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office
Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for
Office applications, which supports &quot;Excel Services&quot;, a client-server
architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time
between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a
web page. While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been
removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its
successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.
