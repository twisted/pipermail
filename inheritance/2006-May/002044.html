UBA Technology Inc. and the Wall Street Journal Agree
&#160;P2P Sports Betting Software May Change Casino Sports Betting

VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA - UBA Technology Inc. (UBTA), has entered into initial negotiations to install its proprietary betting exchange software in traditional land-based casinos

*In the Wall Street Journal article titled, System Would Let Gamblers Bet and Bet and Bet on Game by Peter Sanders, the author explains that current advancements in wireless technology and engineered software solutions will enable sports betters to bet on every play in a particular game, not just the outcome of that game.  &quot;Boosted by improved technology that makes it easier to take bets on every play in a sporting event -- rather than just the outcome -- gambling-technology companies are on the brink of launching new products they hope will entice gamblers at casinos to keep wagering throughout hours-long games.&quot;

With the advent of high speed broadband and wireless services now available on a global basis UBA is well positioned to market its betting exchange platform to qualified online operators utilizing the internet, the emerging kiosk betting sites in land based casinos and ultimately through to the hand-held wireless device offering 24 hour betting service to gamblers world-wide.

MECN predicts that the volume of bets matched (e.g. bets proposed and accepted) in Europe will grow from USD 16 billion in 2004 to USD 159 in 2006, representing an compound annual growth rate of 79% over that span. Note that the MECN forecast is for Europe alone and does not account for gamblers in North America or Asia/Pacific and offers very little in the way of gambling events popular in those regions (e.g. - NFL).

One of the most attractive attributes of the betting exchange market from UBA's perspective is that the forecasted growth rate of 79% per annum through 2008 consists primarily (63%) of new players. UBA believes that due to this huge influx of new participants and the fact that the overwhelming majority of these new players have no pre-existing brand loyalty and are therefore easier and less costly to acquire, the company's unique product offering and aggressive marketing plan will enable it to quickly secure the critical mass required to ensure UBA's liquidity and profitability.

The timing for UBA Technology's entry into the market place is excellent as the global gaming market continues to expand not only for online poker companies (Party Poker - Party Gaming - PRTY.L), traditional bricks and mortar casinos (Wynn Resorts - WYNN) and online gaming software providers (Cryptologic Inc. - CRYP.Q).
