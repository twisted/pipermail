Subject: [Inheritance] Avoid enhancement pills
Message-ID: <cb0701c6adbb$b8598b7b$69339980@backpackers.net>

 Warning! Do not buy enhancement pills, they don't work!

Over the past few years the market has become swamped with imitation male
enhancement pills, making it virtually impossible to know what is legitimate
and what is fake!

The logical step that millions of men are taking is to switch over to the
more effective and potent male enhancement Patches.

Millions of men are already applying male enhancement patches daily and
watching their size and drive go through the roof! Patches deliver the
product into your system in a quicker and more efficient manner than a
pill ever could. They are also safer and more discrete, no need to awkwardly
carry around a bottle of pills. Enlarge Patch Rx is simply the best patch
you will find, anywhere! 

Our Enlarge Patches are the most respected in the industry, the highest
quality at the best price. As of yet no other patch has matched ours for
pure potency and effectiveness, the results you see from using Enlarge
Patch are unreal!

Here are just a few of the thousands of happy testimonials we receive every
year;

""Hi, I have been using Enlarge Patch Rxfor one month. I could not believe
my eyes after about a week of using the product because my flaccid length
only grew a tremendous amount. I started slow since I did not know much
about the exercises but once I retained some experience I began to introduce
myself to the more advanced ones and that is when my penis started growing.

I can not thank Enlarge Patch Rx enough. So overall I started at about
6 inches in length and about 4 inches in girth, which is quite normal and
now im 7 1/4 inches in length and 4 3/4 inches in girth. An entire inch
in both length and girth in a matter of a month! If you want to have gains
and keep them forever you have to try Enlarge Patch Rx, believe me you
will not regret it!"
Robbie V. Texas

"I suppose my story won't be somewhat unusual to you. I'm a young man of
25 and I was completely frustrated about my small penis. I was so shy to
show it to any of the girl I had ?relationship? with that I basically had
no sexual life at all. Enlarge Patch Rx patches did incredible thing to
me. I was using them for 4 months and my penis is much more thicker and
about 2.5 inches longer now. All my doubts are gone. I really appreciate
what you're guys doing. Thanx for saving my life! "
Geoff R. Rhode Island

Subject: [Inheritance] Beware of fake pills
Message-ID: <d94b01c6aebe$578d0f4e$16f5673f@jaydemail.com>

 Warning! Do not buy enhancement pills, they don't work!

Over the past few years the market has become swamped with imitation male
enhancement pills, making it virtually impossible to know what is legitimate
and what is fake!

The logical step that millions of men are taking is to switch over to the
more effective and potent male enhancement Patches.

Millions of men are already applying male enhancement patches daily and
watching their size and drive go through the roof! Patches deliver the
product into your system in a quicker and more efficient manner than a
pill ever could. They are also safer and more discrete, no need to awkwardly
carry around a bottle of pills. Enlarge Patch Rx is simply the best patch
you will find, anywhere! 

Our Enlarge Patches are the most respected in the industry, the highest
quality at the best price. As of yet no other patch has matched ours for
pure potency and effectiveness, the results you see from using Enlarge
Patch are unreal!

Here are just a few of the thousands of happy testimonials we receive every
year;

""Hi, I have been using Enlarge Patch Rxfor one month. I could not believe
my eyes after about a week of using the product because my flaccid length
only grew a tremendous amount. I started slow since I did not know much
about the exercises but once I retained some experience I began to introduce
myself to the more advanced ones and that is when my penis started growing.

I can not thank Enlarge Patch Rx enough. So overall I started at about
6 inches in length and about 4 inches in girth, which is quite normal and
now im 7 1/4 inches in length and 4 3/4 inches in girth. An entire inch
in both length and girth in a matter of a month! If you want to have gains
and keep them forever you have to try Enlarge Patch Rx, believe me you
will not regret it!"
Robbie V. Texas

"I suppose my story won't be somewhat unusual to you. I'm a young man of
25 and I was completely frustrated about my small penis. I was so shy to
show it to any of the girl I had ?relationship? with that I basically had
no sexual life at all. Enlarge Patch Rx patches did incredible thing to
me. I was using them for 4 months and my penis is much more thicker and
about 2.5 inches longer now. All my doubts are gone. I really appreciate
what you're guys doing. Thanx for saving my life! "
Geoff R. Rhode Island

Jul 24, 2006 -- Petro Sun Drilling, Incorporated announced today that the company has entered into a Letter of Intent to acquire working interest in the Sibley Field of Webster Parish, Louisiana. The closing date of the transaction is scheduled for August 8, 2006, subject to the terms of an agreement with ALM Trust Properties, LLC and the Morgan Elizabeth Miles Trust.
 
The leasehold of approximately 1,000 acres includes four proven producing Pettit/Rodessa natural gas and/or oil wells and a minimum of fourteen proven undeveloped oil and natural gas locations as determined by the geological evaluation of well control data. The Pettit, Rodessa, Mooringsport and Paluxy are geological formations that produce oil and/or natural gas within the Sibley Field.

Petro Sun will commence a development program targeting the Mooringsport and Paluxy oil reserves immediately after the closing of the acquisition.

FSBO Media Holdings Enters Into Marketing And Video Production Agreement 
To Produce Video-Spectus'TM' For Cyberhand Technologies, Inc

FSBO Media Holdings, Inc. announced that it has entered into a marketing 
and production agreement with Cyberhand Technologies, Inc. (CYHD - News) 
Cyberhand focuses on Aerospace Weapon Systems that provide the world's 
fastest controllers and most accurate target acquisition, generating the 
best field results, as well as innovative wireless ergonomic products for 
private and military purposes.

The Video-Spectus(TM) is designed to complement the current written or static 
methods of information currently distributed through internet, newswires and 
company web sites. It will also assist the company in marketing its products, 
services or technologies. The Video-Spectus(TM) provides the viewer with an up 
close and personal look at the company by having its officers or company 
spokesperson describe its mission, company achievements or prospects in a 
professionally produced TV-like infomercial. Investor and Public Relation firms 
will also share in the benefits that the Video-Spectus(TM) provides by pointing 
shareholders and clients to the company's website. FSBO Web TV utilizes 
state-of-the-art virtual set technology, which allows the multi-million dollar 
studio look at a fraction of the price. Dynamic tracking shots and corporate or 
hi-tech settings are the norm, not add-ons.

Bob Pianka, President of FSBO TV, Inc. said, "Our Video-Spectus(TM) infomercial 
has become a leading income generator for our company. Companies and IRPR firms 
are quickly recognizing the power of video to get their investor relations and 
new product launch information in front of our very targeted audiences. In addition 
to producing the video itself, we then put the company's Video-Spectus(TM) where 
it will be seen by thousands of potential investors every day."

FSBO Media Holdings Inc., is a multimedia marketing conglomerate that provides a 
vast array of services, from real estate marketing services to media exposure and 
distribution. FSBO Media Holdings is a diversified company consisting of both hard 
assets as well as media properties used to promote and create strong branding programs 
for these assets. FSBO Media also works with outside companies, both public and private,
with an array of marketing, media and branding services.

FSBO Media Holdings Enters Into Marketing And Video Production Agreement 
To Produce Video-Spectus'TM' For Cyberhand Technologies, Inc

FSBO Media Holdings, Inc. announced that it has entered into a marketing 
and production agreement with Cyberhand Technologies, Inc. (CYHD - News) 
Cyberhand focuses on Aerospace Weapon Systems that provide the world's 
fastest controllers and most accurate target acquisition, generating the 
best field results, as well as innovative wireless ergonomic products for 
private and military purposes.

The Video-Spectus(TM) is designed to complement the current written or static 
methods of information currently distributed through internet, newswires and 
company web sites. It will also assist the company in marketing its products, 
services or technologies. The Video-Spectus(TM) provides the viewer with an up 
close and personal look at the company by having its officers or company 
spokesperson describe its mission, company achievements or prospects in a 
professionally produced TV-like infomercial. Investor and Public Relation firms 
will also share in the benefits that the Video-Spectus(TM) provides by pointing 
shareholders and clients to the company's website. FSBO Web TV utilizes 
state-of-the-art virtual set technology, which allows the multi-million dollar 
studio look at a fraction of the price. Dynamic tracking shots and corporate or 
hi-tech settings are the norm, not add-ons.

Bob Pianka, President of FSBO TV, Inc. said, "Our Video-Spectus(TM) infomercial 
has become a leading income generator for our company. Companies and IRPR firms 
are quickly recognizing the power of video to get their investor relations and 
new product launch information in front of our very targeted audiences. In addition 
to producing the video itself, we then put the company's Video-Spectus(TM) where 
it will be seen by thousands of potential investors every day."

FSBO Media Holdings Inc., is a multimedia marketing conglomerate that provides a 
vast array of services, from real estate marketing services to media exposure and 
distribution. FSBO Media Holdings is a diversified company consisting of both hard 
assets as well as media properties used to promote and create strong branding programs 
for these assets. FSBO Media also works with outside companies, both public and private,
with an array of marketing, media and branding services.

(Pink Sheets: GDKI - News), a rising Urban Entertainment force, is pleased to announce that the Company has enhanced its Executive Leadership with the addition of accomplished artist, Frost, as Vice President of the Music Division. Frost is very well respected by already established act and is looked at as a role model by up and coming talent. He was the pioneer of Latin Hip Hop, which has exploded, with the extremely popular, Regaetton over the past 4 years. Frost will serve as an ideal Vice President of Music Operations within Goldmark, due to his extensive musical knowledge, skills, history and experience. His presence on the Board of Executives will only serve to be advantageous to Goldmark's overall growth.
  
Frost -- originally known as Kid Frost -- was a pioneer in the field of Latin hip-hop, cutting some of its very first records and helping to bring exposure to other bilingual MCs. Pioneering Latino rapper Frost only gets better with age. The veteran East Los Angeles rapper, who became a hip-hop icon in 1990 with his groundbreaking single "La Raza" has stepped up his game in the last decade, sharpening his lyrical skills and becoming an authority figure in the rap world. His success allowed such Latino rappers as Cypress Hill, Fat Joe, Big Pun to make substantial hip-hop inroads.

His music features a hard-hitting mix of hard-core hip-hop, smoothed out cuts for the ladies and laid-back songs for cruising. This versatility is one of Frost's strengths, something that keeps him fresh. "The thing keeps my name in people's mouths is that I keep reinventing myself," Frost explains. "I don't just keep on making the same music I want to take bilingual hip-hop a trend I was the forefront of one step further while still kicking vivid rhymes about the code of the streets with authenticity."

Frost is an original and knows about originality. Rapping since 1980 Frost scored his first record deal with Electrobeat Records thanks to the help of his long time mentor and friend Ice-T. When deciding on his name, Frost decided to model his moniker after that of the man who helped start his career, choosing Frost since Frost comes before ice. Then known as Kid Frost, Frost became a regular on the car show circuit in the mid 1980's. When he released "La Raza" and his debut album, "Hispanic Causing Panic" a few years later, his visibility exploded and helped the Lowrider culture thrive in Southern California and eventually Worldwide.

Frost says, "As I see the KRS-Ones and the LL Cool J's still in it, I won't budge. A lot of people might say that I'm too old. But I don't think it's your age or how you rap. It's your rap skills that keep you in the game. As long as we make that knocking Chevy music, we're going to stay in this rap game."

(Pink Sheets: GDKI - News), a rising Urban Entertainment force, is pleased to announce that the Company has enhanced its Executive Leadership with the addition of accomplished artist, Frost, as Vice President of the Music Division.

Frost -- originally known as Kid Frost -- was a pioneer in the field of Latin hip-hop, cutting some of its very first records and helping to bring exposure to other bilingual MCs. Pioneering Latino rapper Frost only gets better with age. The veteran East Los Angeles rapper, who became a hip-hop icon in 1990 with his groundbreaking single "La Raza" has stepped up his game in the last decade, sharpening his lyrical skills and becoming an authority figure in the rap world. His success allowed such Latino rappers as Cypress Hill, Fat Joe, Big Pun to make substantial hip-hop inroads.

"I don't just keep on making the same music I want to take bilingual hip-hop a trend I was the forefront of one step further while still kicking vivid rhymes about the code of the streets with authenticity."

Frost is an original and knows about originality. Rapping since 1980 Frost scored his first record deal with Electrobeat Records thanks to the help of his long time mentor and friend Ice-T.

When he released "La Raza" and his debut album, "Hispanic Causing Panic" a few years later, his visibility exploded and helped the Lowrider culture thrive in Southern California and eventually Worldwide.

Frost says, "As I see the KRS-Ones and the LL Cool J's still in it, I won't budge. A lot of people might say that I'm too old. But I don't think it's your age or how you rap.
