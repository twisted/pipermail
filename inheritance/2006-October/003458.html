<PRE>In business theres no word more powerful than the word.  And what 
is the word?  P-R-O-F-I-T!!!  And thats what our next feature is all 
about.

EverGlory International (EGLY) is involved in one of the most lucrative 
areas of business these days, production in China. Quarter after quarter 
they get to use the word in BIG ways!  Some recent quarterly postings:

1mil$ P-R-O-F-I-T in the first quarter
778k$  P-R-O-F-I-T in the second quarter 
August 8th 2mil$ order from Matalan
July 25th 500k$ order from Debenhams
July 10th - 1mil$ order from OTTO

Please check all these figures with your favorite source.  EGLY is the real 
deal!  We are expecting third quarter numbers to be out soon and are 
telling all of our members to take a position in EGLY before the data is 
out.  These fortuitous figures are going to shock the market and send this 
one way up!

SANTA ANA, California (AP) -- A California congresswoman said she was briefly denied access to a United Airlines flight last week because her name appeared on a &quot;no-fly list&quot; set up after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
NEW BRUNSWICK, New Jersey (AP) -- A woman accused of hacking her husband into pieces and dumping his remains in suitcases has been indicted on new charges of writing anonymous letters to throw detectives off her trail.
LOS ANGELES, California (Hollywood Reporter) -- With world attention focused on the nuclear ambitions of rogue states like North Korea, one might assume that the producers of CBS' promising new drama &quot;Jericho,&quot; which deals with the aftermath of a nuclear attack, are merely playing on Americans' fears.
