<PRE>We found company ready to EXPLODE!! 
Put CGDC on your radar's now. This st0ck shows a significant up in 
stock price and sometimes in days, not months or years. 
Watch CGDC like a hawk tomorrow!! The alert is on!! 


CHINA GOLD CORP 
Symbol: CGDC 
Current Price: 0.09 
Projected Price: 0.72 

A Company engaged in gold and minerals exploration and development of 
gold and mineral properties in China. 


Why consider CHINA GOLD CORP (CGDC)? Seee n0wadays what happened. 

Rising gold prices are further accelerating this gold rush - The 
price of gold has up 250% over the past five years, and this is still only 
a quarter of when the price peaked 25 years ago. (Adjusted for 
inflation.) 

HUGE gold discovery in southwestern China - Resources have already 
been estimated by analysts at 14 million ounces...and the number keeps 
climbing. 

China is the world's last great under-explored land-mass - Locked 
away in a Marxist time-warp with limited exploration technology, China's 
rich virgin gold fields have been overlooked and ignored until recently. 

China is already the world's 4th largest producer of gold  and will 
soon be the world's #1 producer AND #1 consumer. The country is going 
gold-crazy! 

Foreign gold companies are now welcome - and the laws have been 
changed to provide full legal protection. 

You can see China's developing gold boom is building momentum. Rare 
0pp0rtunity for early investors!!
