About Vision Energy Corp.

Vision Energy Corp. offers an efficient, patented technology to 
generate electricity at substantial savings by using the wasted energy 
dissipated when high pressure gas pipelines are let down in pressure for local 
consumption. Up to 70% of electricity generated when using this system 
is produced without combustion of any fossil fuel and therefore no 
harmful atmospheric emissions. Thermal efficiency can exceed 100% by taking 
advantage of both let down energy and primary turbine waste heat 
(exhaust ).
