Hello,
 I visited your site and it's absolutely fantastic and I'd really like to get a partnership it and all/any others you might have. I sent an email a week or two ago but not sure if you recieved it, the reply email address was broken and not allowing mail.

I've put my sweat and blood into a project for other websites and it's time to release it. We have built the absolute largest ever free online games database. It's current number is at 4,181+ free online games and growing. We've spent several months putting this all together by getting the games, renaming them, creating 4,181 thumbnails from PRINT SCREEN command opening 1-4 swf files at a time copying them into PS, resizing, saving, creating pages with keywords, descirptions, titles, game details, instructions and tons more. This took so much time and effort, we are going to allow others to link to the pages with the games on them completely free and with absolutely no work to you.

We created the pages with dynamic links on them already for you, so all you gotta do is download, file > save as or copy the source code from the blank template files and put them into your own website. You can copy and paste it right into your current website layout/template. Your website will then have all 4,181+ of our free online games completely free and you don't have to do ANY work. The games are still legally hosted on our pages so there isn't any licensing you need to worry about or disk space and bandwidth issues since they are hosted by us. It takes up an extra few pages of html code, that it.

http://www.365flashgames.com/free_games_4_your_site.php

All the details are explained on the page link above, and it includes the links for the pages with the games.

Here is the link directly to all 4,181+ free online games:

http://www.365flashgames.com/games.php ( File > Save As  or Right mouse click > view source, copy and paste into your own website).

That is all the work you have to do, 2 mins and you have 4,181+ free online games. Please feel free to pass this page around the net, send it to all your affililates and let them post it on their website also. Add as many games as you like ;)

There are so many great benifits to you from doing this and it's completely free. 

1. You get to have 4,181 free online games on your website at ZERO cost to you. Your visitors will return and bookmark your site FOR SURE!

2. Google and other major search engines will crawl YOUR page on YOUR site, seeing all 4,181 games/names and pagaluate them. You will get more hits from google and yahoo searches when any game is searched. This can improve your hits by thousands of extra visitors a day.

3. Did I mention ZERO COST to YOU already?

4. Extra page of content has MANY benifits. Google absolutely loves it. Your visitors will bookmark your site and return to it for playing games and a huge advantage is that when any game is searched in the 4,181+ huge collection, your site will get listed in the search. That is alot more hits for you at no cost.

Have phun and please don't abuse, post extra links giving credit to the sites that host them and pass the word on about this! Linking the 50 sites these games are hosted at will also benifit you because your site will show up right below the original site when that site is searched for in search engines.

Please feel free to use this page as many places or sites as you want, tell your friends and they can put it on there site/ include it, just download it or view the source and copy all of it. Let your users know ;) where to go for more games, we are the LARGEST network of free online games site in the world.

Note:
**A Great way to get your site out there as well is to add another page to your site, allowing your users to download the source for the games page with 4,181 free online games, and add your link under the "Special Thanks to" links. This stuff spreads like wildfire and it will make your site Immensely HUGE!**

When you add all 4,181+ free online games to your site please send us an email letting us know that you did it, please include your link html code so we can add your link to all 50 sites so we can send you some free hits.

We would also like to get a link exchange with your site and all 50 of these sites as well.

Thanks for your time and please let me know ASAP if you added our links and or 4,181 free online games to your site so I can add a link back for your website and don't forget to add your email address to our free newsletter, we send out an email to the newsletter members whenever there is a significant update in new games.

If you have any advertising/banners/textlinks/popup inventory open on your site or were thinking of adding a small popup to your pages, I can get you a special super high rate for popups. If you'd like to do that or even try it for a day, just let me know ;) I'm 100% sure that you will be satisified with your earnings, they are the best paying company out there especially when you add the special rate. A small website with even around 3,000-4,000 uniques daily can expect to make well over several thousand dollars a month without breaking a sweat, honestly, not joking. It's worth a try and what do you have to loose, try it for 24 hours and see how much you will make for a month, you'll be shocked. If you interested let me know. I have AIM so if you got a screenname let me know it and we can talk ;)
