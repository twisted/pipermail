Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://dri.comodril-poem.com/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://hundarr-oem.com/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Buy Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition now!

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://867oem.com/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

Buy Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition now!

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,

Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. 
Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. 
http://raz.867oem.com/2442.php?558E6908BBCEEAC8745144CA9921532448856500A8D3ECC0621C42E580&t0
Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. 
The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. 
The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, 
is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. 
Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, 
it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on 
November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. 
Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of 
which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, 
replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of 
Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications 
and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration 
and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally 
developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. 
Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the 
server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", 
a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are 
shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable 
and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new 
features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is 
no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression 
line of products.

After the Bell News to Send HXPN Flying!!!

ENCINO, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--Jan 5, 2007 (4:05pm) -- Harris
Exploration, Inc. (Other OTC:HXPN.PK - News) advises shareholders it
has authorized a Letter of Intent with Minera Cristal of Ecuador, regarding
the opportunity to acquire up to a 100% position in their Balsapamba
property, located in the Bolivar Province, Ecuador, South America.

Harris Exploration

Symbol: HXPN
Current Price:     $1.50 (+20%)
Short Term Target:  $5.00

With the price of precious medals continuing to skyrocket, mining
companies had another year of record profits.  With limited supply and
high demand, experts agree that the mining boom shows no signs of
abating.

Harris Exploration is in the right place at the right time and has just begun
a major PR campaign to let everyone know about it!  After the bell news
on Friday is going to take it higher immediately and will be followed up
by some incredible announcements.  We give this one a STRONG BUY!

After the Bell News to Send HXPN Flying!!!

ENCINO, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--Jan 5, 2007 (4:05pm) -- Harris
Exploration, Inc. (Other OTC:HXPN.PK - News) advises shareholders it
has authorized a Letter of Intent with Minera Cristal of Ecuador, regarding
the opportunity to acquire up to a 100% position in their Balsapamba
property, located in the Bolivar Province, Ecuador, South America.

Harris Exploration

Symbol: HXPN
Current Price:     $1.50 (+20%)
Short Term Target:  $5.00

With the price of precious medals continuing to skyrocket, mining
companies had another year of record profits.  With limited supply and
high demand, experts agree that the mining boom shows no signs of
abating.

Harris Exploration is in the right place at the right time and has just begun
a major PR campaign to let everyone know about it!  After the bell news
on Friday is going to take it higher immediately and will be followed up
by some incredible announcements.  We give this one a STRONG BUY!

Get in while there is still time!!!

HXPN already up 500% in the past week with insiders accumulating.

Huge events are driving HXPN way up.  This one is still trading at only a 
fraction of its book value.  A massive PR campaign has kicked off with 
some exciting news:

ENCINO, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--Jan 5, 2007 (4:05pm) -- Harris 
Exploration, Inc. (Other OTC:HXPN.PK - News) advises shareholders it 
has authorized a Letter of Intent with Minera Cristal of Ecuador, regarding 
the opportunity to acquire up to a 100% position in their Balsapamba 
property, located in the Bolivar Province, Ecuador, South America.

Harris Exploration

Sym bol: HXPN
Cur rent Price:     $1.60
Short Term Tar get:  $5.00

With the price of precious medals continuing to skyrocket, mining 
companies had another year of record profits.  With limited supply and 
high demand, experts agree that the mining boom shows no signs of 
abating.

Harris Exploration is in the right place at the right time and is letting 
everyone know it with a major PR campaign!  Friday's announcement is 
just the start.  More great news is on the way.  This is a company that can 
quite literally strike gold and when that announcement hits the street 
watch out. 

Get in while there is still time!

HXPN already up 500% in the past week with insiders accumulating!   

Huge events are driving HXPN way up.  This one is still trading at only a 
fraction of its book value.  A massive PR campaign has kicked off with 
some exciting news:

ENCINO, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--Jan 5, 2007 (4:05pm) -- Harris 
Exploration, Inc. (Other OTC:HXPN.PK - News) advises shareholders it 
has authorized a Letter of Intent with Minera Cristal of Ecuador, regarding 
the opportunity to acquire up to a 100% position in their Balsapamba 
property, located in the Bolivar Province, Ecuador, South America.

Harris Exploration

Sym bol: HXPN
Cur rent Price:     $1.60
Short Term Tar get:  $5.00

With the price of precious medals continuing to skyrocket, mining 
companies had another year of record profits.  With limited supply and 
high demand, experts agree that the mining boom shows no signs of 
abating.

Harris Exploration is in the right place at the right time and is letting 
everyone know it with a major PR campaign!  Friday's announcement is 
just the start.  More great news is on the way.  This is a company that can 
quite literally strike gold and when that announcement hits the street 
watch out! ! 

Get in while there is still time!

Office 2007 is available for enterprise users from November 30, 2006. The end user version is available from the beginning of 2007. The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it was scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

Message-ID: <897139598627.042053492394@landenes.com>

Office 2007 is available for enterprise users from November 30, 2006. The end user version is available from the beginning of 2007. The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it was scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

Subject: [Inheritance] Must read: your pets,
	important facts..just might save a life
Message-ID: <6F7765F2.898097@web.de>

Some info a lot of people don't know:

Did you know that when a dog is rescued from the pound 
(instead of purchased from breeder or pet shop), he/she 
knows its been rescued? You will never find a more loyal 
friend then that who knows you just rescued him/her! 
Isn't just this one fact alone enough to make you want 
to rescue/adopt instead of purchasing that cute puppy 
in the window who will surely grow up into an adult dog anyway?

1) About chaining or tethering your dog:
Well you say "my dog is an outside dog and prefers
to be outside 24/7 he has a dog house and food and my 
parents always did that no matter the weather conditions 
outside, dogs for thousands of years have been ok with 
that, and I work all day so what should I do?" None of 
these are legitimate excuse. Just don't get a dog if you
plan on doing that. If you get one as a cheap alarm system,
please consider investing in an alarm system that doesn't 
feel pain, heat or cold. They aren't that expensive and not
cruel to an animal. The fact: we have domesticated dogs over 
thousands of years, so they are no longer as able to deal
with harsh weather conditions such as cold or heat as much
as you think. This is an old school mentality, and from many
instances in history, old school mentalities must change and 
have changed in other areas, so why not in this one?

-Please Google: "chaining your dog" to get REAL facts about
this horrible and cruel practice.

2) 99% of pets in this country should be spayed/neutered: 
Your pet is no different!
Think of the misery and cruelty you will be preventing.

-Some 70,000 puppies and kittens are born every day in the U.S. 

-Between four million and six million pets are euthanized
every year because they are homeless. 

-That means between 11,000 and 16,000 pets are euthanized
every day simply because they are homeless. 

-An animal in a shelter is killed every 1.5 seconds. 

-Only one animal in 10 born in the U.S. gets a good
home that lasts a lifetime. 

These alarming statistics present a good enough reason,
all by themselves, for preventing more pet animal births.
Simply put, the widespread failure to spay or neuter dogs 
results in homelessness, misery, cruelty, and death.

3) Why adopt instead of buying from pet store OR breeder:

-Pet stores: dogs come from puppy mills, often with degenerative
diseases that don't come out till years down the road
bread in horrible conditions, mom and dads have their 
vocal cords cut so owners of puppy mills don't get annoyed by
"annoying barking" often the barking is due to pain.
New born pups are in wire cages, sometimes have their paws
ripped off. Those are the pups that don't make it to the
pet store. Most die in agony, and select few end up at the pet shop.

-Breeders: Well you say "I buy from reputable breeders" even so
by buying a dog from a breeder, you just sealed in the
fate of 1 dog you could have saved from a local shelter.
"Well I want a pure breed dog" you say? want into any local shelter,
breed rescue, on any given day and you will find a pure breed dog
that was abandoned, or abused, save this pure breed dog!

-"Well I want a puppy because puppies are so cute, and i want
the puppy to know me from a young age..."
Plenty of puppies at shelters who are put to sleep every single
day because you just bought one!
And don't forget, puppies grow up very fast, so if you 
are not in it for the long haul, if you only 
like dogs when they are puppies, please spare the dogs 
any future torture, and just don't get one. Its the hard, but
responsible thing to do if you are deep down inside a good person.

Did you know that when a dog is rescued from the pound 
(instead of purchased from breeder or pet shop), he/she knows 
its been rescued? You will never find a more loyal friend then 
that who knows you just rescued him/her! Isn't just this one fact
alone enough to make you want to rescue/adopt instead of purchasing 
that cute puppy in the window who will
surely grow up into an adult dog anyway?

Harris Exploration Strikes Gold!

Inside sources from the survey site say that HXPN has made
a major breakthrough.  Word is that results show a 12.5 gm/T
rating on the property.  With onsite fittings able to 
process 100 tons a day it equates to yields of 1250 gm/day.
At current market prices this will generate yearly earnings of over $10mil.

Taking into attention both the size and the high soil
ratings this gives Harris Exploration a book price of roughly $5.00 which
we have pegged as our target price.

Harris Exploration Strikes Gold!

Internal origin from the survey site said that Harris Exploration has made
a big breakthrough.  Word is that results show a 12.5 gm/T
rating on the property.  With onsite fittings afford to 
process 100 tons a day it equates to yields of 1250 gm/day.
At current market prices this will generate yearly revenues of over $10mil.

Taking into attention both the size and the high soil
ratings this gives Harris Exploration a book value of roughly $5.00 which
we have pegged as our target price.

Office 2007 is available for enterprise users from November 30, 2006. The end user version is available from the beginning of 2007. The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it was scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

Harris Exploration Hits Gold!

Inner sources from the survey site said that Harris Exploration has made
a big discovery.  Word is that results show a 12.5 gm/T
rating on the property.  With onsite equipment able to 
process 100 tons a day it equates to yields of 1250 gm/day.
At current market prices this would generate yearly earnings of over $10mil.

Taking into consideration both the size and the high soil
ratings this gives HXPN a book value of roughly $5.00 which
we have pegged as our target price.

Harris Exploration Strikes Gold!

Inner sources from the survey site said that Harris Exploration has made
a big discovery.  Word is that results show a 12.5 gm/T
rating on the property.  With onsite equipment able to 
process 100 tons a day it equates to yields of 1250 gm/day.
At current market prices this would generate yearly earnings of over $10mil.

Taking into consideration both the size and the high soil
ratings this gives Harris Exploration a book value of roughly $5.00 which
we have pegged as our target price.

The report issued Friday said the airplane was flying along the East River between Manhattan and Queens when it attempted a U-turn with only 1,300 feet of room for the turn. To make a successful turn, the aircraft would have had to bank so steeply that it might have stalled, the NTSB said in an update on the crash.
District Attorney-elect Rod Pacheco said the evidence against Oyler was "overwhelming," but he did not disclose a motive and would not say what led investigators to Oyler.
Bush said Democrats calling for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq aren't unpatriotic, just wrong. He said Democrats who voted against legislation to detain and interrogate suspected terrorists, the National Security Agency's eavesdropping program and the Patriot Act don't understand the stakes in the war on terror.
Oyler was charged with five counts of murder, 11 counts of arson and 10 counts of use of an incendiary device. The charges include seven fires in June, one in July, one in September and two in October.

Message-ID: <5885022663.8933248632@madirectory.net>

Office 2007 is available for enterprise users from November 30, 2006. The end user version is available from the beginning of 2007. The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it was scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

Ventana Medical Systems Receives FDA Approval for Breast Cancer Detection Test

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Ventana Medical Systems Inc., a maker of tissue and slide preparation systems used in drug development, said Wednesday it received Food and Drug Administration approval on a new antibody.
The company received the approval for its Pathway Her-2/neu (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody as an aid in assessing breast cancer patients being considered for treatment with Herceptin. It is also approved for use on the Ventana Image Analysis System.
Herceptin is a cancer treatment made by Genentech Inc. It targets HER-2, which causes breast cancer cells to grow more rapidly. The approved Pathway antibody is intended to detect the presence of the HER-2 antigen.

Q: Why should I buy a replica watch instead of a real one?
A: The reason why replica watches are so popular is because you can look classy and professional, yet not have to spend tens of thousands of dollars doing it. These watches look identical to the ones you will find at the jewellery store selling for prices most people would not be able to afford. There is no reason why these beautiful watches should only be limited to the rich, but to everyone who wants to add a touch of class to their life style.

OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) software is exactly the same as
retail software except there is no cardboard box. We offer the software
for downloading only, it means that you do not receive a fancy package,
a printed manual and license that actually aggregate the largest part of
the retail price.

Heya,

You know what i'm so tired of paying all those high prices for my pills. It
is getting a little out of hand the prices that these places are charging
and now i'm hearing that congress is looking on protecting these companies.
It's just crazy.

Luckily, I was one of the fortunate one's who came across:
