<PRE>OTC-Advisors.com and bullishalrets.com Issue Watch Alert On SZSN

Shandong Zhouyuan Seed and Nursery Co., Ltd (SZSN)
$0.33 UP 37.5%

Market watchers are already alerting investors that SZSN in on the rise
and moving fast. Read the news and get on SZSN first thing Monday
morning!

But I see some stealth legal tricks. Don't wish to give up control or
change your development model? Madsen got that part wrong. By all means
we will respect any legitimate patents by ripping out whatever we need
to, pay whatever we need to, and work around it.
You are giving in to Mafia-like threats based on fear.
&quot;  And he confirms that the license back to Novel

That should help you understand why there are rules in court about
hearsay and parol evidence that Novell is asking the court to employ to
toss out all such &quot;evidence&quot;. It's because people sometimes lie and
sometimes they misremember and sometimes they forget completely.

So share with the community what you know. Mathematics is primarily a
language for ensuring reliable results in human-social interactivity.

If anyone knows how to put the numbers on the clocks on Cafe Press,
please tell me.

Of course, like you, I was reminded of the Microsoft-Novell patent deal.

I am Vice President, Anti-Piracy Legal Affairs for the Recording
Industry Association of America, Inc.

Here's his analogy: &quot;No, it is just a street directory, no map. So
that's why what the actual wording says, if it's clear, trumps what
people think or thought or say. There, SCO complained it  was compelled
to pay for an unnecessary product.

It doesn't actually say what the exhibits are in support of, but it was
filed with that motion, so I must assume that is its purpose. I'd talk
about the interoperability agreements, but &quot;Microsoft&quot; and
&quot;interoperability&quot; don't really belong in the same sentence.

You must know what they are, if you are &quot;respecting&quot; them. Notably  I
see no copyrights  listed for anything but books and documents, except
for  a Novell SDK CD, which was not going to be continued. I don't even
know what he's talking about. And if you signed without knowing about
any specific patents, say so. I woke up thinking it was Friday, and it's
been like that all day. Tanya Andersen, the plaintiff here, is the
single mother in Oregon that the RIAA prosecuted for the last couple of
years and then &quot;on the eve of summary judgment&quot; dropped the lawsuit with
prejudice.
Chris had mentioned that one question the judge asked Stuart Singer, who
argued for SCO, was what should a judge do if the contract says A, B, C
and the witnesses say it meant X, Y, Z? And we've proven willing to put
up with some temporary frustration in order to get it. You are indeed a
great artist! I just wanted to say out loud how hard it was to try to
get everyone's wants included. The only new argument SCO raises relates
to evidence SCO failed to present on time. Or else we can sue them.
You are saying, What, again?

That doesn't change the outcome.

It also implies that the existing information technology solution is
portable and that it can be removed and replaced with that of another
vendor with minimal effort and without major interruption.

Not with respect to mathematics, but with respect to its very close
cousin physics, the sixteenth I told you they wanted your brains.
JACOBS: The authority of all of us is a little limited. The issue then
becomes is this such a situation, where the contract trumps SCO's
witnesses? &quot;  Again, this is in connection with books.

If so, it's a wasted strategy. Well, there are rules for monopolies.
I wonder what she thought SCO used to write OpenServer?
I wonder what she thought SCO used to write OpenServer? So, have at it,
if you wish to lend a hand and this is an area you are qualified to
analyze. But it surely doesn't work in the glare of the Internet's
spotlight, and it's something I hope someday their lawyers explain in a
book or an article.
