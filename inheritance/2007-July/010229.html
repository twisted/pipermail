LTDI Breaking News:
Latitude Industries Inc. a manufacturer of high-performance, center
console
powerboats, announces today that it has implemented a new and exciting
way
to stay in touch with its customers, prospects and shareholders.

About Latitude Industries
Latitude Industries is a manufacturer of high-quality, offshore sport
fishing boats. The company's boats fuse innovative design with advanced
light-weight composite materials that resist rot and decay and retain

WATCH LTDI WEDNESDAY!
THE ALERT IS ON!!!

&quot;Even if banks could repossess software, it's intellectual property,&quot;
Brian Madison, general manager of Microsoft Financing told me this
afternoon. It has too many peripheral intentions not impacting the
customer problem of document formats and, in fact, cements the monopoly.
They support the DRM and they complain that there's DRM. all of my old
software runs. Financing removes some of the pricing pressure associated
with upgrade protection.
The lession here is, avoid this defective product and support, like the
plague. I think microsofts need to satisfy its partners, kills some of
it's ability to control the design and features of any phone.

Jackson's meetings with journalists during Microsoft's antitrust trial
led an appeals court to remove him as the trial judge. Getting in bed
with corporations and ad agencies and selling out the customer is
looking to become much more profitable for them. Yes, Bill has spyware
built in Office to &quot;phone home.

The song remains the same, with a few new verses tacked on to the
chorus. But Microsoft's long-term goal clearly is to subsume these
products' functions; the approach would be similar to what Microsoft is
trying to do now with business intelligence. all of my old software
runs.

It's funny how Joe, Mary Jo and the others have not figured out what a
big part of Microsofts new look VCSY is.

How unlucky has been Microsoft over the years?

What integrates better with other technology?
With this type of cash reserve, it would seem a next step in its future
plan of buying businesses.
