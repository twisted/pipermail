I've played on and off with pumps, weights, and exercises for the last few years and have never gained one centimeter. I recently began LNH Maxdik and was pleasantly surprised to see that this product actually works. I have been on the product 2 months now and I have already gained 1 inch. Its fantastic! My new girlfriend is really impressed with my size and stamina.


</PRE>
