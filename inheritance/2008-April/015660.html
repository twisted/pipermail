<PRE>We would like to thank John from FL, USA for sending us his before and after photos and also letting us show them on our site.

I've played on and off with pumps, weights, and exercises for the last few years and have never gained one centimeter. I recently began LNH Maxdik and was pleasantly surprised to see that this product actually works. I have been on the product 2 months now and I have already gained 1 inch. Its fantastic! My new girlfriend is really impressed with my size and stamina.


</PRE>
