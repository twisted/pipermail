In business theres no word more powerful than the word.  And what 
is the word?  P-R-O-F-I-T!!!  And thats what our next feature is all 
about.

EverGlory International (EGLY) is involved in one of the most lucrative 
areas of business these days, production in China. Quarter after quarter 
they get to use the word in BIG ways!  Some recent quarterly postings:

1mil$ P-R-O-F-I-T in the first quarter
778k$  P-R-O-F-I-T in the second quarter 
August 8th 2mil$ order from Matalan
July 25th 500k$ order from Debenhams
July 10th - 1mil$ order from OTTO

Please check all these figures with your favorite source.  EGLY is the real 
deal!  We are expecting third quarter numbers to be out soon and are 
telling all of our members to take a position in EGLY before the data is 
out.  These fortuitous figures are going to shock the market and send this 
one way up!

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republicans unleashed a firestorm of criticism Tuesday against Sen. John Kerry after the Vietnam veteran told college students they'd "get stuck in Iraq" if they didn't work hard in school.
DARLINGTON, South Carolina (AP) -- The mother of a teenage girl who was kidnapped, raped and locked up in a crypt-like space says the accused "needs to be locked up in a hole" for the rest of his life.
NEW YORK (CNN) -- More than 140 years ago, Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, uttered a famous piece of advice to an advice-seeker: "Go West, young man." Democrats seem to be heeding that advice as they look to expand their electoral base.

CNN Announces Oil At Nearly $62 a barrel and continuing to rise!
WBRS continues to develop domestic Oil and natural gas sites! Volume Jumps 2200% today alone!

Company: Wild Brush Energy
Symbol: WBRS
Price:  $0.05
Target: $0.25 (5 Day Target)

WBRS is a diversified energy company whose primary goal is to identify and develop Oil and Natural Gas sites in Wyoming Basin. With 7 current land leases accessing the over 19 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and over 500 Million barrels of Oil you can clearly see the potential in this company.

With Oil prices climbing at alarming rates and or current oil crisis it is no wonder investors are jumping into WBRS today and pushing volume up over 2200%. With that kind of movement and a news release update on current operations we are excited to see the price rocket tomorrow and can easily see this climb to over $0.25 by end of next week!

This is one industry that is not going to fall. Where else will you grab a stock like this at only $0.05? Watch for news tomorrow and get in first thing Friday.

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA-(MARKET WIRE)-Nov 6, 2006 - 9:45am-
The Relationship between Ever-Glory and Disney's Agent is 
going well, with Orders Recorded in Excess of $100,000 for

Hi, Dear!

em..... 
I gotta tell you something. Some years ago I used to watch porno often. I always admired those guys cumming.
They splashed out so much sperm on their girls, it looked so cool, so manlike. 
Now I have a girlfriend.. but quantity of my sperm was so scanty, that I felt ill at ease.


 I was advised to eat green apples but even this didn't help. A month ago I was hanging around at the bar with my best friend. 
And he said that I should try xynaVOLUME. Well, - I thought, - sounds interesting. 

Next day I came to know that it was really a highly effective all-natural dietary supplement,
 which not only increases the sperm volume but also improves the sperm quality and the mobility of spermatozoa.

Having ordered and tried I was shocked how cool it was. 

I'd even say, it changed my life. I'm happy. I even became a better lover, knowing how it all would end. 
By the way, read about xynaVOLUME at this site:

http://cheevseplanner.com


Yes, that guys have really acceptable prices if you decide to order and ship worldwide.

We called it yesterday and now it's up 100%!  Brand new 
issue, Cana Petroleum, heading straight up!

VERY tightly held, in a booming business sector, with a 
huge publicity campaign starting up, Cana Petroleum (CNPM) 
is already bringing our readers huge gains.  We advise you 
to get in on this one as well and ride it to the top! 

Symbol: CNPM
Current Price: 5.87
Projected Price: $15.40

Check the stats!  Check the level 2!  Imagine what this one 
will do when the full force of the PR campaign hits it, in 
conjunction with smashing news!

Major oil discovery?  We are not permitted to say at this 
point.  All we can say is that this one is going to see 
amazing appreciation in a very short period of time!  This 
is your opportunity.  Win big with CNPM!

The Shorts are out! The Gap is Good! Take advantage!

Company: Red Reef Laboratories
Symbol: RREF
Price: $0.215

RREF has been on a steady rise for a week with HUGE volume. Now the
shorts created a gap providing a second chance to get in on RREF.

It's $0.215, and will climb hard back to $0.40 by early next week.
Don't be the one that missed out be the one who rakes it in next
week. Grab RREF first thing Thursday morning.

To kill two birds with one stone.

Sex is like war, both are exciting but neither informative. Example: When our car ran out of gas, we were up a creek without a paddle. Possible Interpretation: Women do not like the nice guys. Don't have too many irons in the fire. Make love, not war.
Penny wise, pound foolish. While there's life, there's hope. Still waters run deepest.
Never eat the yellow snow. A Frank Zappa song. Salvage Something From Every Setback. - R Sankaranarayanan Never shove your Granny when she's shaving. Give the Devil his due.
It's the squeaky wheel that gets the grease. Bloom where you are planted. He that will steal an egg will steal an ox. Nothing to be feared in life ,but understood. The beauty of things lies in the mind that contemplates it If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
Possible Interpretation: living life to its fullest All that glistens is not gold. There is only eight years been success and failure in politics. -Jim Brown, Louisiana statesman Good eating deserves good drinking.
No news is good news. Rule #1: Dad is always right. Rule #2: If dad is wrong, refer to rule #1. Paraphrased from The Mourning Bride, act i, scene i, by William Congreve. Hair of the dog that bit you. Briefer version 'A miss is as good as a mile'

Possible Interpretation: Not everything is what it appears to be. Not worth ! you wont get. Make yourself worthy. (Manu MR) Play on 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away' A creaking door hangs longest. and A creaking gate hangs long. You can lead (take) a horse to water but you can't make it drink.
This too, shall pass. Why have a dog and bark yourself? Meaning: Kind words/actions are more effective in bringing about an outcome than harsh ones.
Variant: Ornithological specimen of corresponding plumage congregate gregariously Don't put the cart before the horse. Knock and the door will be opened unto you. --Matthew 7:7 It's a good horse that never stumbles.
Hey is for horses. Meaner than a junk-yard dog. Why have a dog and bark yourself? Variant: Always look on the bright side of life Paraphrased from The Mourning Bride, act i, scene i, by William Congreve. There's always a deep breath before a plunge.
If you keep your mouth shut, you won't put your foot in it. Beauty is only skin deep, but ugliness goes straight to the bone. New brooms sweep clear. >From Occam's Razor where the simplest explanation is the most likely.
The best things in life are free. Never put off till (until) tomorrow what you can do today. The third time someone tries to put a saddle on you, you should admit you're a horse. It's not the size of the boat. The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

NEW YORK (AP) -- The O.J. Simpson book saga took another twist Tuesday when his former sister-in-law, Denise Brown, accused the media company behind the project of trying to buy her family's silence for "millions of dollars."
EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP, New Jersey (AP) -- Autopsies were being conducted Tuesday on four women whose bodies were found in a seedy area just outside Atlantic City.
LOS ANGELES, California (AP) -- Robert Altman, the caustic and irreverent satirist behind "M-A-S-H," "Nashville" and "The Player" who made a career out of bucking Hollywood, has died at 81.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- NASA's best effort to find a missing Mars space probe failed Monday night, as scientists at the space agency began to lose hope for the 10-year-old planet-mapping workhorse
ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Perhaps Darren Aronofsky should have called his new movie "Love and Death." (Though that's been taken.) Or, for prurient viewers, "Rachel Weisz in a Bathtub." (But that would be misleading.) 
(CNN) -- Although Congress is unlikely to follow calls from a top Democrat to bring back the military draft, the United States does have a plan, if necessary, aimed at inducting millions of young men for service.

Dear Webmaster,

I am handling online marketing for my client www.advantagesportsbetting.com
As an ongoing process to increase the link popularity of my site, I am currently in the process of building Triangular Link Swaps for this client site (We link to you from one site, and in return, your link to our other site). Triangular link swaps work better in helping both sites rank highly in search engines such as Google, Yahoo and MSN. I recently came across your site and found it beneficial resources for my client's site. I will give you a link back immediately from our Directory at PR 3 or PR 4.

My site detail is as follow:

URL: http://www.advantagesportsbetting.com/sportsbook/ncaa-football.html
Title: Sports Betting And Football Betting
Description: Advantagesportsbetting offers offer the largest variety of Las Vegas odds, lines, spread, props on Pro & College Football.

Your link will be added at: http://www.webmaster-link-exchange.com/listings-cat-22-page-1.html   [PR 5]

You can also use the following HTML code of my site:

<a href="http://www.advantagesportsbetting.com/sportsbook/ncaa-football.html" target="_blank"><strong>Sports Betting And Football Betting<br/></strong></a>Advantagesportsbetting offers offer the largest variety of Las Vegas odds, lines, spread, props on Pro & College Football.

Please add my link using the above detail and then send me an e-mail with the URL where I can find the link of my client site and also send me exact link code of your site which I will add to my site.

If you have any other sites for which you are interested in exchanging links for ... We've got dozens of other high quality client sites. Please let me know.

Information in this report may contain forward looking statements within 
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21B of 
the SEC Act of 1934, statements that involve discussions of future events. 
Don't rely on them. Past performance isn't indicative of future results. 
We received five hundred thousand free trading shares from a third party, not 
an officer, director or affiliate. We intend to sell all five hundred thousand shares 
now, which could cause the stock to go down. This company has: nominal cash, nominal 
revenues in its most recent quarter, a nominal judgement against it, back taxes due and 
the float of stock is currently increasing. These factors raise doubt about its ability to 
continue as a going concern. A failure to finance could cause the company to stop operating.
There isn't adequate, current information available on this company. This is a high risk stock. 
This report shall not be construed as any kind of investment advice or solicitation.

Live and let die Look before you leap Rome wasn't built in a day There's always a deep breath before a plunge
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies It is not so much the gift that is given but the way in which the gift is driven Many a mickle makes a muckle We must take the bad with the good Speak of the devil and he shall appear An Englishman's home is his castle
Hair of the dog that bit you In order to get where you want to go, you frist have to leave where you are The whole is greater than the sum of its parts From the Latin, de gustibus non est disputandum
There's more than one way to skin a cat Up a creek without a paddle A loaded wagon makes no noise Money talks It never rains, but it pours

Q: Why is the software so inexpensive?
A: We offer the software for downloading only, it means that you do not receive a fancy package, a printed manual and license that actually aggregate the largest part of the retail price. In this situation we are restricted in selling the products for private purposes only! You will not be able to get a technical support and different rebates from the manufacturer. Updates are available for the most of our products (you may ask our support staff for the exceptions) that make them fully functional and operating. Additionally you save the delivery cost.

Q: Is OEM as functional as a retail version?
A: Yes. OEM software is exactly the same as retail software except there is no cardboard box.

Dear customers and friends of DS Team,
Please let us represent our new special offer you can't afford to miss. Announcing Microsoft Office 2007 Enterprise Edition. Office 2007 will be available for enterprise users by November 30, 2006. The end user version will be available in the beginning of 2007. The 2007 Microsoft Office System, also known as Microsoft Office 2007, is the most recent version of Microsoft's productivity suite. Formerly known as Office 12 in the initial stages of its beta cycle, it is scheduled to be made available to volume license customers on November 30, 2006, with general availability following in early 2007. Office 2007 contains a number of new features, the most notable of which is the entirely new graphical user interface called the Ribbon, replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception.Office 2007 also includes new applications and server-side tools. Chief amongst these is Groove, a collaboration and communication suite for smaller businesses which was originally developed by Groove Networks before being acquired by Microsoft in 2005. Also included is Office Sharepoint Server 2007, a major revision to the server platform for Office applications, which supports "Excel Services", a client-server architecture for supporting Excel workbooks that are shared in real time between multiple machines, and are also viewable and editable through a web page.While Office 2007 includes many new features, one has been removed entirely: Microsoft FrontPage is no longer being developed; its successor is the Microsoft Expression line of products.

Alert! Watch this one Soar!

Equipment & Systems Engineering, Inc. (EQSE)

Sector: Environmental Engineering
Rating: VERY Bullish
Current Price:  $0.062
Projected:        $0.20

This is THE pick for the fourth quarter.  Environmental 
stocks are getting incredible exposure and taking off as 
governments and companies realize they need to start 
investing NOW.  EQSE is involved in high tech solutions for 
both the problems we face today and those of the future.

Search your favorite financial information site and become 
a believer.  This is HOT!

An earth shattering release is expected out of the company 
any day.  With all of EQSE's governmental contacts we are 
expecting a major contract announcement.  This issue is 
VERY tightly held and the release is going to push it up 
rapidly.  Don't delay.  It's not going to stop till we see 
20 cents!
