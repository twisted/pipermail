<PRE>Hi,
 
Patrick Burke with Navistaff.  I have the following VC++/C# development
position with Citigroup in NYC.  By May, the position will be located in
Jersey City.  It is full-time, permanent and will pay up to 115k base.
Ideally, this person should have anywhere between 3-8 years of
experience.  Financial industry knowledge is not required, though
helpful.
 
Any referrals would be greatly appreciated!

 
The key goals for the STP initiative are to:
-  Provide straight thru processing of all OTC equity derivative
products (including the full array of exotic products).
-  Implement STP across all international regions.
-  Demonstrate system scalability and real time efficiency for trade
ticket flow from front to back office.
-  Allow for unimpeded growth of the OTC &amp; Exotic derivatives business.
 
For the P&amp;L system re-write, key goals are to:
- Demonstrate system scalability.
- Increase the number of P&amp;L calculations offered.
- Identify and automate solutions to overcome operational issues
effecting P&amp;L.
* The application suite EQRMS, is currently being used by traders,
salespeople, operations staff, financial controllers, and risk managers
on the Equity Derivatives Desks in London, Hong Kong, New York, Tokyo
and Sydney.  
*  The EQRMS front end is an MFC GUI written in C++ that communicates to
calculation servers to obtain live calculated risk metrics.  The server
components are run on Windows NT and coded in C++, and the applications
use Rendezvous as a middleware/messaging layer and a Sybase database.
There are websites for customer valuations and some
straight-thru-processing written in C#.
 
KEY RESPONSIBILITIES
*  Understand the EQRMS system.
*  Contribute to design decisions implemented in C# on the STP and/or
P&amp;L initiatives.
*  Work with colleagues to refine your design for scalability,
maintainability, and efficiency.
*  Be mindful of the effects to other regions (ie. LN, HK) of the code
you design and implement.
*  Code and unit test your design.
*  Contribute to identifying testing scenarios for your designs and
communicate these to a QA team.
*  Communicate your ideas clearly with a focus on how end-user
functionality is impacted.
*  Be a team player and be ready to learn as well as contribute.
*  Adapt to a fast pace environment, which also includes some 2nd line
production problem debug and solutions.
 
Key Relationships:
*  Fellow Colleagues
*  Equity business traders and operations staff
*  Equity technology teams
*  Market Data Services
 
EXPECTED OUTCOMES (WHAT WILL &quot;SUCCESS&quot; LOOK LIKE IN 12 MONTHS)
*  Implementation of STP and P&amp;L systems with clear recognition that
your contributions played a meaningful role.
*  Ability to support these systems and debug 2nd line business problems
associated with them.
*  Recognized ability to take on new projects for the EQRMS application
suite.
 
KEY CHALLENGES (WHAT IS THE WORK/MARKET ENVIRONMENT)
*  Coming up to speed quickly with the EQRMS system and associated
project initiatives.
*  Fast paced environment
*  Many high priority demands
*  Working with complex systems
*  Interaction with other technology teams
*  Design functionality for a high-volume business without performance
impact
