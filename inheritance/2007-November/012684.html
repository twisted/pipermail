That's great you've found a girl that's hot
You wanna plough her moistened twat.
She's cute and taking, she's so nice!
But would your penile size suffice?
Not sure she will long for more?
You need a dong she would adore!
But how to get it long and thick?
Your only chance is MegaDik!
You'll get so wanted super-size

Your shaft will pound her poon so deep,
Tonight you'll hardly fall asleep!

So try today this wonder-pi'll
And change your life at your own will!
