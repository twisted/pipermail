At last you've got a babe that's hot
You wanna nail her dripping twat.
She's so attractive, she's so nice!
But would your penile size suffice?
Not sure she will long for more?
You need a thing she would adore!
But how to get it long and thick?
Your only hope is MegaDik!
You'll get so wanted super-size
And see great pleasure in her eyes!
Your schlong will pound her poon so deep,
Tonight you'll hardly fall asleep!

So try today this magic p'ill
And change your life at your own will!
