That's great you've met a lass that's hot
You wanna hump her juicy twat.
She looks so sizzling, she's so nice!
But would your penile size suffice?
Not sure she will yearn for more?
You need a dong she would adore!
But how to get it long and thick?
Your only hope is MegaDik!
You'll get so wanted super-size

Your schlong will pound her poon so deep,
Tonight you'll hardly fall asleep!

So try today this magic p'ill
And change your life at your own will!
