Subject: [Twisted-web] Twisted 16.1 Release Announcement
Message-ID: <367BC573-64FD-4694-ADA1-C78B5D45E257@atleastfornow.net>

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am honoured to announce the release of Twisted 16.1!

This release is hot off the heels of 16.0 released last month, including some nice little tidbits. The highlights include:

- twisted.application.internet.ClientService, a service that maintains a persistent outgoing endpoint-based connection -- a replacement for ReconnectingClientFactory that uses modern APIs;
- A large (77% on one benchmark) performance improvement when using twisted.web's client on PyPy;
- A few conch modules have been ported to Python 3, in preparation for further porting of the SSH functionality;
- Full support for OpenSSL 1.0.2f and above;
- t.web.http.Request.addCookie now accepts Unicode and bytes keys/values;
- `twistd manhole` no longer uses a hard-coded SSH host key, and will generate one for you on the fly (this adds a 'appdirs' PyPI dependency, installing with [conch] will add it automatically);
- Over eighteen tickets overall closed since 16.0.

For more information, check the NEWS file (link provided below).

You can find the downloads at <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted> (or alternatively <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads>). The NEWS file is also available at <https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-16.1.0/NEWS>.

Many thanks to everyone who had a part in this release - the supporters of the Twisted Software Foundation, the developers who contributed code as well as documentation, and all the people building great things with Twisted!

Twisted Regards,
Amber Brown (HawkOwl)

Subject: [Twisted-web] Twisted 16.1.1 Prerelease 1 Announcement
Message-ID: <A5C56BB7-CFFF-4A7D-8E1B-72B290445F53@atleastfornow.net>

Hi everyone,

I'd like to announce a prerelease of the upcoming Twisted 16.1.1, a patch release for Twisted 16.1. This fixes a regression in twisted.web where requests would not be logged.

The tarball and NEWS file can be found at https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/16.1.1pre1/ . Please test this release with your software.

If no issues are found, it will be released in a day or two.

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am honoured to announce the release of Twisted 16.1.1!

This is a small bugfix release in the 16.1 series, fixing a bug where `twistd web` would not output access logs.

For more information, check the NEWS file (link provided below).

You can find the downloads at <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted> (or alternatively <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads>). The NEWS file is also available at <https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-16.1.1/NEWS>.

Subject: [Twisted-web] Changes to Twisted's Trac (GitHub Authentication)
Message-ID: <9C021F7C-297A-4D8D-8C47-32B66DC57FC1@atleastfornow.net>

Hi everyone,

If you've ever had your password eaten by our Trac instance, had your comment rejected by spambayes, or seen the amount of effort it takes removing random nulls from our htpasswd files, rejoice! With https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/pull/192 , we are moving our Trac instance to log in using GitHub OAuth. This should mean we solve the issue of keeping passwords (making you and us more secure), being able to turn off the spam filter (as we don't have anonymous ticket submittal, and github is better at catching spammers than we are), and hopefully cause less ongoing issues with passwords suddenly not working.

What this means for you is that your username and password will no longer work for logging into our Trac, you will need to authorise your GitHub login to access it. This means that you may have another username, please contact me privately and I will see what I can do about migrating any ticket histories over, if you feel like it is needed.

Subject: [Twisted-web] [MIGRATION COMPLETE] Changes to Twisted's Trac

I would like to note that this migration has now finished, and you can now log in via GitHub. Legacy logins have been disabled, and previous admin accounts (except for a current handful) have been revoked in the name of minimising our security surface; if you once had access to our Trac and would like to still use it, please let me know what your GitHub user account is, and I can set those permissions back up.

Amazing! :-D.

I feel a disturbance in the force, as if a million spammers cried out, and were suddenly silenced :-).
