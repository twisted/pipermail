<PRE>twisted.web.template is great to have.  I'm doing a client's web app
project with (so far) just twisted.  So far the only thing I really
miss from nevow is that I cannot load a template from a fragment
identifier in an xml document, but just for reasons of convenience.

I need to know who is logged in.  Twisted offers
twisted.web.guard.HTTPAuthSessionWrapper to perform the initial
authentication, but then when a page element wants to know the
identity of the authenticated user, there seems to be no provision for
this.  Furthermore, there seems to be no place in the classes I am
invited to write to work with twisted.web.guard where both the request
object and the avatarId exist at the same time.

The only opportunity I have to bind a user identity/object to a
request is by constructing and throwing away a new Resource tree for
each request in requestAvatar.  I decided that was probably not what I
was meant to do.  Instead, I have done something that turns out to
smell very bad to solve this problem.  What was the correct solution?

Mine was to subclass HTTPAuthSessionWrapper and override
_authorizedResource and _login in order to pass the request object as
the mind.  From there I can use request.setComponent in requestAvatar
and request.removeComponent in the logout callback (just for fun) to
associate an authenticated user object with the request.  I'm not even
sure that's what &quot;mind&quot; is for, and it's not cool copying and pasting
the body of a couple of methods out of the library.

My next task appears to be to write a credential factory that can take
credentials out of the cookies or session, to support a friendly login
interface.  Again I feel as though I am whacking my way through what
should be a clear trail.  It's dangerous stuff to be writing as
application code.  Am I just expecting too much from twisted.web a la
carte?  Is nevow a viable choice anymore?

TIA for just one or two lines of wisdom.
