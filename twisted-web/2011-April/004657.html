For what it's worth: I decided exactly the same thing way back when, and 
also discovered that, no, you are supposed to do that.

I thought about why I'd decided that, and came to the conclusion it's 
just not intuitive - it &quot;felt&quot; wrong - but couldn't be more specific. 
Possibly it's because almost every other web framework I've ever seen, 
python or not, gives you a &quot;user&quot; object of some description on the request?

Perhaps a note in the web/guard docs suggesting this approach might tip 
people off.

(That said, I don't use Twisted for web stuff anymore, so it's not of 
much interest to me)
