You have my sympathies.  Seriously, unless you really have to write a SOAP  
application, please don't.  SOAP is totally unnecessary for web services,  
despite what corporations and large technology firms claim.

Ok, now that I've made my token attempt to save you from committing to  
crappy technology, on to your actual question.

&gt;<i> In the C/C++ I would use gSOAP to take a WSDL and generate the support

</I>&gt;<i> Twisted (I know something of SOAPpy but I am not sure I can use it
</I>&gt;<i> directly under Twisted).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There is only one WSDL library that I am aware of, and it is available as  
part of the pywebsvcs project.  The same place where you got SOAPpy,  
actually, so you most likely already have it.  You will have to do a fair  
amount of work to integrate all of that auto-generated gobbledygook with  
twisted, up to and including replacing the network communications portion  
of said auto-generated code.

Others here with more positive views on WSDL and friends may give you a  
more optimistic answer, and after all, the problem does just boil down to  
a Simple Matter of Programming.  Then again, you want all this  
auto-generated code in order to avoid programming, right?  Catch-22.

Hope this helps,

L. Daniel Burr
