</I>You just described exactly the problem I am currently having with
twisted-web2. I tried to create wsgi as a root resource, however its also
dependent on static files in media directory. I wasn't able to create a
child object due to no matter what it passes full path to the wsgi
application. So then I made it a child of a root resource, this sort of
worked. But since the root path was consumed when it is passed to the child
resource, when the application does a redirect, it creates the url in
relation to root, not the child url. In my own application I could work
around this without too much difficulty since I already know where my child
is in relation to the root object.
