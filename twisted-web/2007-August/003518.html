[Discusion of streaming file uploads in twisted.web]

&gt;&gt;<i> Someone with deeper knowledge of twisted.web may be able to propose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a strategy for implementing streaming file uploads
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't mind if I do ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Always good to have a core developer weigh in on these matters ;)

&gt;<i> HTTPChannel already notices the difference between when the headers have
</I>&gt;<i> all been received and when the body has been received entirely. When the
</I>&gt;<i> former occurs, allHeadersReceived is called.  In the base implementation
</I>&gt;<i> this sets up a file-like object into which the body will be written.  It
</I>&gt;<i> would be possible to do something slightly different here in order to
</I>&gt;<i> support streaming uploads: do resource traversal to find the IResource
</I>&gt;<i> the upload is being sent to and then let it deal with bytes received in
</I>&gt;<i> the body of the request.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That sounds pretty reasonable.

&gt;<i> The only other things which might not be obvious here.  Changes to
</I>&gt;<i> twisted.web should be backwards compatible so that existing twisted.web
</I>&gt;<i> applications continue to work without being modified.  Implementing
</I>&gt;<i> what I've described above without regard for backwards compatibility  
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> probably mean subjecting existing applications to two things:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You lost me here.  First you say that changes to twisted.web should be
backwards-compatible, then you go on to describe how to do things in
a non-compatible manner.  I don't have a preference regarding the
issue of compatibility, but I'm not clear as to whether you do.

&gt;<i>   * resource traversal would be performed earlier than usual for the
</I>&gt;<i>     application.  This might have adverse consequences, or it might not.
</I>&gt;<i>     In the absense of any way to know for sure, we shouldn't change this
</I>&gt;<i>     behavior.  So, instead, the code might require a new kind of site, or
</I>&gt;<i>     an attribute to be set on the root resource, or something else of 
</I>&gt;<i>     this sort which would allow new applications to indicate their
</I>&gt;<i>     preference for the new behavior while preserving the existing
</I>&gt;<i>     behavior for existing applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure, this sounds a bit like the way nevow uses Element for doing
things in the new, context-less way, while leaving Fragment in place
to handle the existing, context-laden way.

&gt;<i>   * The body of a request is currently available in the request object
</I>&gt;<i>     itself.  Existing applications won't expect it to be elsewhere, nor
</I>&gt;<i>     will they expect to have to handle the upload as it is happening.  It
</I>&gt;<i>     should be required that resources indicate in some way that they are
</I>&gt;<i>     capable of handling streaming uploads.  This might be done by adding  
</I>&gt;<i>     a new interface which they must implement (since they will need to  
</I>&gt;<i>     provide methods for handling bytes from the upload, this is  
</I>&gt;<i> necessary     anyway).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I expect it would be a fair amount of work, and end up looking  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> similar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to what is already in web2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, &quot;fair&quot; is quite subjective, so maybe it is and maybe it isn't ;)
</I>
Point taken, although I'll point out that from the perspective of the
original poster, &quot;fair amount of work&quot; might mean &quot;lots of work and
cursing&quot;, given the usual newbie experience with twisted and its
learning curve.

&gt;<i> It
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't strike me as a massive undertaking, though.  I think an initial
</I>&gt;<i> patch could probably be done in a day or two.  Allow another couple of  
</I>&gt;<i> days
</I>&gt;<i> (not necessarily elapsed - there might be some latency in finding  
</I>&gt;<i> reviews,
</I>&gt;<i> etc) to get feedback and make whatever improvements are suggested, and  
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> would probably be it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, that'd be pretty awesome, and would benefit nevow users too.

&gt;<i> FWIW, what I described doesn't resemble the support for this  
</I>&gt;<i> functionality
</I>&gt;<i> in web2 at all, I think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
True, and I'm somewhat surprised, given the work currently going on
with web2.  Isn't dialtone's consumer/producer oriented stream stuff
going to be &quot;the way&quot; to do this sort of thing?  Does twisted.web
have to approach it differently, due to design constraints?

Thanks for taking the time to think through this,

L. Daniel Burr
