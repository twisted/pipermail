Version 8.2 of Twisted is now out (actually, it's been out for over a
week now!). You can download it (in Windows, Mac, and source forms)
at:

    http://twistedmatrix.com/

Twisted 8.2 is a major feature release, also including many important bug fixes:

 * twistd now has a --umask option for specifying the umask
 * Log observers can now be configured in .tac files
 * ProcessProtocols can now implement processExited to get reliable
notification of a process exiting
 * FTPClient has many more convenience methods
 * Twisted.words now has a standalone XMPP router
 * Twisted.names now supports NAPTR records
 * Twisted.web can now deal with multi-value headers and supports the
Range header in requests for static files

There have been many additional improvements which you can read all
about in the release notes:

This year is for 9.x version, isn't?

Message-ID: <2dcdf68e0901080840s635b3feajd202dc3eb1a94af3@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,


This is one of the rather vague questions everybody (rightfully)
hates, but if it's a generic
problem somebody had encountered in the past, I'd assume he can spot the match.

I'm using Python 2.5, Twisted 8.1, web2 and its wsgi module -- under Win32.

Everything works like a charm when run as  a normal application, but
when running as a Win32 service
using the win32service and win32serviceutil modules, spurious HTTP
errors 500 are generated.

Another twisted server app I wrote which doesn't use web2 and wsgi
doesn't show this
problem.

Does this rings any bells?


Regards,
Peter

Not with me.  Are there no associated errors in the log file?  Usually
a 500 should come with a traceback.

I ran across something vaguely similar developing a server to run as a 
service.  What I found out whas that win32serviceutil runs the server in 
its own directory, rather than the Python script's directory; my server 
looks for files in its own directory.  I wound up using a registry 
setting to record the directory, and having the server use it to do a chdir.

This may have nothing to do with your problem, but FWIW...

Vague question deserves a vague answer.

With the very similar setup I have run into spurious errors trying to
write to a Response.
The amount of data and writing to a stream seemed to matter.
For example:

>>> resp = Response(mimetype='text/json')
>>> simplejson.dump(obj, resp)

was failing on occasion, but

>>> Response(simplejson.dumps(obj), mimetype='text/json')

worked.  Besides, like JP wrote, what the traceback says.

Subject: [Twisted-web] Athena behind apache
Message-ID: <49714C87.30800@yahoo.it>

Hi alls,

LivePage is working fine when I connect directly to the
twisted server.

When I put my resources behind apache, I need to define
transportRoot and jsModuleRoot, otherwise my client has
localhost'ed references.

When I connect directly, I have references like this:

  http://localhost:8090/foo/bar/<HASH>/jsmodule/Nevow

For Apache, I'm trying to init the LivePage with:

  jsModuleRoot= url.URL('https', FQDN, ['foo', 'bar', 'jsmodule'])
  transportRoot= url.URL('https', FQDN, ['foo', 'bar'])

LivePage doesn't work. I can't guess the right urls.

Apache works as transparent proxy, so I'm wondering if I need
to specify jsRoot and transportRoot to obtain something like:

  https://fqdn/foo/bar/<HASH>/jsmodule/Nevow

But... how? Any hint from Athena coders?

Finally, a stupid question.

Why LivePage build javascript references using the FQDN?

Maybe it's a better idea to build links like:

   '/foo/bar/<hash_there>/jsmodule/Nevow'

Obviously, one can always specify trasnportRoot and jsModuleRoot.

But in this case it should work for transparent proxies out of
the box.

Isnt'it?

Best Regards

Message-ID: <ac6d9e320901270205t246cbafdhae6d33b1d4571e44@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
    I use twisted-getPage to post a lot of data (5Kb separate elements) to
the server.
    Now, this data is sent every 5 seconds. The server can take upto 1-2
minutes to process the data and reply back. One issue that I am seeing is
that if I kill the sender (Cntrl+C) after I sent this data and then start it
immediately, the reply for the earlier message actually interferes with the
current process.
i.e. any further connections fails too - the error that comes is:
[Failure instance: Traceback (failure with no frames):
twisted.internet.error.ConnectionLost: Connection to the other side was lost
in a non-clean fashion.

If somebody could help me on this, I would be much thankful.

In a normal configuration, Ctrl+C tells the reactor to shutdown.  That closes
all connections and prevents you from making any new ones.  If you want Ctrl+C
to do something else, you have to install a custom signal handler for it.
