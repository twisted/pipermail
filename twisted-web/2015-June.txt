Subject: [Twisted-web] Web Server Bandwidth Tracking
In-Reply-To: <mailman.5.1432058402.18593.twisted-web@twistedmatrix.com>

I want to release zopache.com as a web development platform, but I worry
that someone will overload the servers.

So I have to track bandwidth for each user account. 

Traditionally this is done by creating log files and processing them,
but that seems exceedingly complex.  Much easier to just have a python
object for each user account, and track the amount of bandwidth used in
the last day, week and month.  Even for 50K users that cannot require
that much RAM. 
Even if the web server goes down, and I loose the data, I do not care. 
I just need to be emailed when limits are exceeded.

Is this a good idea, or should I be using log files?

For years i have been watching Twisted, but never really required it. 
Maybe this is a good excuse to start using Twisted.   Currently I am
using NGinx. 

Is there a library you would recommend to help me with this.  An hour
spent searching the web did not turn up anything.   It can't be that
hard to do.

What do you think?

Regards
Chris

Message-ID: <9B343C10-E611-4FB9-B70D-7BBE3BDC3CC8@atleastfornow.net>

Hi everyone,

As mentioned in http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2015-March/029258.html , Twisted is removing Python 2.6 support. As such, I would like to announce that 15.3 will be the last release with 2.6 support. After this release, the Python 2.6 buildbots will be removed from the 'supported' list and most likely retired.

This will remove all buildbot coverage of OS X and RHEL/CentOS. As I've been taking point on the buildbots recently, I'm going to be deploying a new CentOS 7 buildslave which will provide coverage of that platform. That just leaves OS X uncovered -- so if you would like to donate buildslaves for this, please send me an email.

I don't think that we covered terrible well why we are dropping support.  So I'm going to give my take on this, and if 

We want Twisted to be available in all kinds of environments.  Since it's Twisted's job to let your program talk to the outside world, it's pretty important for you to be able to upgrade it wherever.  Heck, we still support Windows XP!  Plus, while occasionally annoying, Python 2.6 doesn't impose a significant maintenance burden.  So superficially it would seem that we would totally support Python 2.6.

However, Python 2.6 is unsupported by the upstream Python maintainers, and given the increasingly hostile threat landscape, inconveniencing ourselves even a little bit to provide the false impression that Python 2.6 is a "supported" environment where doing new development is OK is not worthwhile.

"But glyph", I hear my hypothetical interlocutor say, "didn't you just say Windows XP isn't supported?  surely that's more of a security risk than python 2.6!" 

It's true that Windows XP is a worse security risk, but the difference between XP and 2.6 is that we support Windows XP may bean immutable fact of access to some hardware.  According to <http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey <http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey>>, roughly 3% of gamers still use Windows XP, and there's no way for someone writing a Steam game to deliver an OS upgrade along with it, because they don't have access to that environment.  The best we can do there is hope that those people eventually buy new computers.

However, if you're delivering software into a Python 2.6 environment, unless it's an embedded environment without support for 2.7, it is at least to some degree under the "your" control (by "your" I mean the software author, which may be an organization where a particular individual who wants to use Twisted doesn't have a say).  The only such environment I am aware of is Sublime Text 2, which unfortunately did not upgrade to Python 2.7, but Sublime Text 3, which supports Python 3.3, has been out for over 2 years now.

That said, discontinuing Python 2.6 support in this way - simply removing the buildbots and letting people using it on 2.6 eventually start getting syntax errors when they try to import some random module doesn't help to communicate this intent very well.

To that end, I'd like to propose that we follow suit with the Cryptography project, and emit a DeprecationWarning in 15.3.  When you 'pip install cryptography' into a 2.6 environment today, it says:

.../site-packages/cryptography/__init__.py:25: DeprecationWarning: Python 2.6 is no longer supported by the Python core team, please upgrade your Python.

We could say something similar, adding something like "16.0 will not support python 2.6 and may not work at all in your application".

I don't think it would be worthwhile to do this in every possible unsupported / de-supported environment, but this affects a particularly large audience, many of whom may be ignorant of the issues at stake.  <https://caremad.io/2015/04/a-year-of-pypi-downloads/ <https://caremad.io/2015/04/a-year-of-pypi-downloads/>> indicates that roughly 10% of Python users are still stuck on some version of Python 2.6; hopefully Cryptography will be exerting some subtle pressure to get those numbers down.

Hm... It's like my mail client decided to do an "Undo" right before sending.

This should say:

"I don't think we covered terribly well why we are dropping support.  So I'm going to give my take on this, and if Hawkie's differs, hopefully she can expand on that."

I think this is backwards.  There was basically no strong argument made 
against dropping Python 2.6 support but there was no case made for 
dropping OS X support.  I don't think you can remove the only OS X 
builder from the supported list.  That's equivalent to saying OS X 
support is being dropped.

So either the existing OS X slaves need to be upgraded first (I don't 
see why you wouldn't just do this) or Python 2.6 support (at least on OS 
X) needs to be retained until someone else volunteers a Python 2.7 OS X 
slave.

Hi JP,

I know that this would leave OS X uncovered -- lukasa, habnabit, and Adi have at separate points offered OS X builders of varying OS levels and even Python versions, both on the mailing list and in #twisted-dev (where Lukasa answered the call from this email and offered a Yosemite builder today), which is why I am confident that this will not end up being an issue when 15.3's first prerelease is issued.

I think the prevailing reason that we don't have an OS X 2.7 bot is that last time OS X hardware was offered, the buildbot was not being actively maintained. I've taken up the mantle in some capacity and getting Twisted supported on more platforms is my primary goal. And as an OS X user, I have some vested interest in it continuing being supported.

I'd be even more confident if you don't disable the Python 2.6 OS X 
builder until a new Python 2.7 OS X builder is set up.  If this turns 
out to be easy, then nothing has been lost.  If it ends up being hard, 
then it's much better than having a screwed up 15.3.

Once again, I'm not really clear on why the existing build slaves aren't 
just being upgraded.  Why is new hardware required?

I think JP's point is that instead of saying "the OS X builder is going away, and if someone steps up there will be another one" we should say "we will make alternate plans for OS X before shutting off 2.6 support".  I'm inclined to agree; if it's not going to be hard to do the upgrade anyway, we should make it a precondition.

15.3 is the last release *with* Python 2.6 support -- that is, the 2.6 builders will be on the supported list until at least 15.3 is released. The goal is that we have both 2.6 and 2.7 on OS X tested before 15.3's release.

I would much prefer to have a new builder to take up the role, migrate the buildslave roles, and then upgrade the existing 10.6 slave once we have something new working. That way, if something goes wrong during the upgrade, we maintain a supported OS X builder.

I think I've been failing at communication a bit -- a prerequisite of dropping 2.6 support has always hinged on getting 2.7 (and optionally 3.3/3.4) builders for platforms that only had 2.6. I have a RHEL7 builder in the wings to get that platform supported, Debian has 7 & 8 now supported, and there's OS X, which I am confident I can get 2.7 builders set up for before 15.3.

Subject: [Twisted-web] How does Twisted Web Multiprocess work ?
Message-ID: <CACZ+WpxQJNwWo1Dfw8zY9ir=H=SUwGyTiNJv7XUYnc10OELx0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am exploring Twisted Web for my RESTful application. My application is
stateless and involves storing and retrieving objects based on Object-ID.
This application will run on beefy (multicore, lots of memory) machine.
However, not all APIs that the application issues to underlying storage are
async and hence I cannot fully utilize Deferreds
Which means, there will some blocking calls and hence my primary interest
is to use Twisted Web in multiprocessing mode

I came across
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10077745/twistedweb-on-multicore-multiprocessor

However, I am not sure if it is the "correct" way of doing things.

Hence I had some questions around it:

1.  Is there an interface (similar to defertoThread) which allows me to
execute a blocking call in a separate process ?

2. Does reactor synchronize access of all processes to the shared listen
socket ?

3. Is there a sample code I can refer to  where the application is spawning
subprocesses to handle HTTP requests ?

Thanks in advance!

We've used SO_REUSEPORT (which is briefly mentioned on the SO page you
linked to) in order to run multiple processes. On a recentish Linux the
following approach has worked well for us:

    # Make a socket with SO_REUSEPORT set so that we can run multiple web
    # applications. This is easier to do from outside of Twisted as there's
    # not yet official support for setting socket options.
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
    # The following might not work on older kernels, or SO_REUSEPORT
    # might not be available if Python was compiled with older headers.
    # In the former case you're out of luck, but you can define the
    # header yourself if it's missing from Python's socket module.
    s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEPORT, 1)

    # Listen on all interfaces on port 1234.
    s.bind(('0.0.0.0', 1234))

    # Use a backlog of 50, which seems to be fairly common.
    s.listen(50)

    # Adopt this socket into something more Twisty.
    endpoint = AdoptedStreamServerEndpoint(reactor, s.fileno(), s.family)

    # Prevent garbage collection. This is something we discovered we
    # needed, and is perhaps something that AdoptedStreamServerEndpoint
    # ought to do itself.
    endpoint.socket = s

    # Create a service with the endpoint.
    service = OurService(site_endpoint)

(Derived from src/maasserver/eventloop.py in MAAS.)

We then use Upstart (Ubuntu 14.10 and before) or systemd (Ubuntu 15.04)
to run multiple processes. For us this mean 4, but you can have as many
or as few as you need, for example 1 process per CPU core. I like this
approach because we can use the system's facilities for process
supervision instead of cobbling together our own.

One caveat is that the processes are running concurrently. If you're
modifiying shared resources you'll want to consider explicit locking
where before you might have been safe with Twisted' single-threadedness.

Thanks Gavin

Good to know how things are done at your end. thanks!
However, why is Twisted not internally using SO_REUSEPORT ? Is there any
plan to integrate it inside twisted so that application need not worry
about it ?

The problem with code mentioned here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10077745/twistedweb-on-multicore-multiprocessor
is that the requests are not equally distributed across all processes. This
imbalance leads to underutilization of CPU cores. This issue is also
discussed on https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/
and that this is not an issue with SO_REUSEPORT

Does it mean that Twisted is using single listening socket and all
processes accept() on that socket ?

thanks

There is a twisted developer guide for communicating with child processes:
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/process.html

I'm not sure I understand why having multiple processes listen on the same
socket is desirable in your case.  From reading the articles you linked to,
it seems like it is only useful in the case where a forward proxy becomes a
bottleneck.  Is that the case wirh your application?

Thanks,
Carl Waldbieser

Hi Carl

The only motivation to use multiple processes is to be able to parallelize
blocking calls (since event driven handling is not useful)  In my case
forward proxy is not a bottleneck, however when my code spawns multiple
processes as per
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10077745/twistedweb-on-multicore-multiprocessor

and I run multiple concurrent clients, I see that the server's processes
are not efficiently utilized. Specifically, even if there are outstanding
requests, one of the processes accepts requests lot more while other
processes are idling. I was able to confirm this by printing the Process
IDs of the processes which are handling request

This sort of imbalance could lead to underutilization of CPU - also
discussed here https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/

Hence I was curious to know how Twisted multiprocessing works. It seems
SO_REUSEPORT is not used within Twisted and as per Gavin's reply can be
used "outside" of Twisted.

I suspect it's only because it's fairly new in Linux and support hasn't
been written/merged into Twisted. Someone else might have detail to add
to that; in this regard I'm only a user of Twisted (for now... maybe
I'll get an itch to address this in Twisted itself if someone else
hasn't already done so).

That's interesting. We used SO_REUSEPORT for convenience but it's good
to know that it's balancing nicely too :)

Each process gets its own socket, but the kernel allows all of them to
bind to the same local address:port.

If you need more processes you can start them without ceremony and it'll
all Just Work. Likewise when killing processes. Done right, you can have
seamless upgrades of your service by restarting one process at a time.
No need for special support from a supervisor.

Gavin.

The application will always need to "worry about it", even if that just 
means making a single API call to re-start itself inside a process pool. 
Twisted can't just fork and re-exec app code that isn't expecting it.
