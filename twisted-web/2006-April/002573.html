</I>
I'm not a Twisted developer, so no worries. :)

&gt;<i> As WSGI is going into python 2.5, I was wondering what the general

</I>&gt;<i> well into twisted's asynchronous model? 
</I>
Not as well as it should IMO.  There seems to be some disdain
for asynchronous servers on the WSGI list.  I tried to
advocate on the WSGI list for better support for asynchronous
servers, especially wrt threading issues.

&gt;<i> Does twisted already have
</I>&gt;<i> everything it needs, so WSGI doesn't bring much to the table?
</I>
WSGI makes it much easier for applications to leverage Twisted,
so it increases Twisted's potential user base.

&gt;<i> It appears that as AJAX becomes more popular then the asynchronous
</I>&gt;<i> model might scale better with many small requests. 
</I>
An asynchronous model works well for many requests period,
whether they are large or small.

&gt;<i> Say I have a WSGI
</I>&gt;<i> app and I want to port it to twisted.  How easy is that?  (I know
</I>&gt;<i> there is a twisted wsgi module)
</I>
Trivial.

&gt;<i>  Do I just need to wrap some logic in deferreds?
</I>
No. You don't have to do any twisted programming at all to use the
web server via WSGI.

IMO, to get the full scalability benefits you want, you may
need to address some threading issues.  You might look at the
Zope 3 integration, which isn't as clean as it ought to me.

&gt;<i> Are any twisted people using WSGI?
</I>
I don't know. Zope 3 is using it. Zope 2 will be using it in
the future.  I don't think we count as Twisted people.
(Although we might count as twisted people. ;)
