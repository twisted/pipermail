&gt;&gt;<i> What is a 'prevision'?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1) We don't have any idea of what will happen in the future

#2.  That was what the &quot;context is going away, streams are going away&quot; stuff was.

&gt;<i>I'm not sure of this point.
</I>&gt;<i>Athena depends on the reactor, but when using Nevow with Zomne, don't we
</I>&gt;<i>have a full twisted application running?
</I>
True.  But you also have a full web server running.

&gt;<i>By the way, what about:
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;&quot;&quot;Running your Nevow applications under twisted.web also gives you
</I>&gt;<i>access to some of the more advanced &quot;Live&quot; features of Nevow, such as
</I>&gt;<i>nevow.livepage and nevow.canvas. Currently, these modules require more
</I>&gt;<i>control over the HTTP socket than CGI or WSGI can provide. (This may
</I>&gt;<i>change in the future.)&quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>in
</I>&gt;<i>nevow-deployment.html
</I>&gt;<i>?
</I>
That document is probably slightly out of date.  For example, nevow.livepage has been deprecated in favor of nevow.athena.  I don't think anyone is maintaining nevow.canvas any more.

&gt;<i>lighttp is gaining popularity, so there are opportunities to have it
</I>&gt;<i>available on many hosting solutions.
</I>
Yes.  Personally, I love lighttpd; I would really like it if, for example, when Mantissa starts a web server, it could automatically put static content in a front-end lighttpd proxy.  I should really file a ticket for that...

lighttpd, like twisted.web[2], supports reverse proxies as well as other forms of frontend/backend server communication.

&gt;<i>Just a question:
</I>&gt;<i>it is possible to forward an HTTP request using Unix domain sockets?
</I>
Yes

&gt;<i>Is this supported with Apache and lighhtp?
</I>
Not as far as I know.  Everything sucks except Twisted ;-).

&gt;&gt;<i> Yes but _WHY_ don't you like the idea?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I like the idea of a full separation between a web server and a web
</I>&gt;<i>application.
</I>
Can you name a single problem that this solves, or feature that it enables?

&gt;<i>The question is:
</I>
Yes.  That is exactly the question.  However, you've phrased it misleadingly.  Since the invention of linking libraries, &quot;program&quot; does not have to be the same thing as &quot;process&quot;.  You can run a web server *library* as part of your web server *application* to communicate with the central web server on a particular system.  There is also the question of what role a particular process serves in a particular environment, which is only tangentially related to the protocol that it should speak.

There are different requirements for serving requests at different points in a pipeline.  There are web front-end proxies which do nothing but inspect a cookie and send the request, bytes unmodified, on to another machine.  There are servers which will internally process some requests (&quot;static content&quot;) and forward others (&quot;dynamic content&quot;).

In other words,

&gt;<i>- what can do a web server?
</I>
Translate HTTP requests into behavior (such as dispatching to an application)

&gt;<i>- what have to do a web application?
</I>
Translate HTTP requests into behavior (such as processing orders for a store)

&gt;&gt;<i> [...] twisted.web.distrib [...]
</I>
&gt;<i>This is interesting.
</I>
Yes, I do think so :).

&gt;&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I hope I've made it clear that no, it isn't.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks for the exhaustive explanation.
</I>
You're welcome.

</PRE>
