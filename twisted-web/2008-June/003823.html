&gt;<i> Hey everyone,

</I>&gt;<i> Divmod's been talking to various hosting companies about potential
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted deals (and maybe even support). I wanted to get a gauge of
</I>&gt;<i> people's level of interest in the services we've been discussing.
</I>&gt;<i> We're currently looking at the following options:
</I>&gt;<i>  * Dedicated hosts, with Twisted libs pre-installed on them
</I>&gt;<i>  * Virtual hosts/&quot;slices&quot; with Twisted libs pre-installed on them
</I>&gt;<i>  * Clouds that support uploading and running Twisted apps
</I>&gt;<i>  * Potential support contracts where Divmod engineers provide
</I>&gt;<i> high-level assistance for paying customers
</I>&gt;<i>  * Becoming a reseller and offering these services directly through Divmod
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been approached privately by a few developers who use Twisted in
</I>&gt;<i> their projects at home and at work with questions about Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> hosting. They've been interested to know if 1) Divmod does Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> hosting, 2) anyone provides &quot;out of the box&quot; support for Twisted, and
</I>&gt;<i> 3) who we recommend.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know that as the years pass, I have less and less time to manage my
</I>&gt;<i> own systems responsibly. After 6 years, I'm closing down my colocated
</I>&gt;<i> boxes. When Twisted makes it to the cloud, I'll close down my virtual
</I>&gt;<i> hosts, too. I just don't have the time any more. All I need is
</I>&gt;<i> reliable uptime for my apps (most of them are just sites with dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> content).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How many others on these lists feel that they would benefit from the
</I>&gt;<i> ease of pre-installed Twisted and/or support for Twisted apps in the
</I>&gt;<i> cloud?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you do, what kinds of apps (that you are currently running) do you
</I>&gt;<i> want to be able to run in such environments? Simple web sites? DNS
</I>&gt;<i> servers? Game servers? Chat applications? Web/data services apps?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>We use a stackless python/twisted self-hosted server with MySQL for our 
online game (in alpha). This isn't particularly satisfactory and would 
consider a twisted host in the future.

I made enquiries with several ISPs here in the UK and none were prepared 
to offer twisted capable servers. I guess divmod may have more leverage!
&gt;<i> And lastly, what hosting companies are your favorites? Where would you
</I>&gt;<i> be happiest, if they supported Twisted? Would you consider switching
</I>&gt;<i> to a hosting provider that *did* support Twisted?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking forward to hearing the people speak,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> d
