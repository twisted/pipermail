I had all sorts of weird problems with the data caching in woven. I did=20=

try some workarounds, but never found one=A0I was happy with and that=20
worked quite properly. I don't recall ever seeing the problem with=20
wmfactory_ methods (just custom data objects), but I wouldn't be all=20
that surprised.

I've now moved to nevow, which doesn't cache data behind the scenes and=20=

thus doesn't have these problems.
