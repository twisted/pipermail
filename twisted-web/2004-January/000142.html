&gt;<i>From Mr.Patrick Tama      ( <A HREF="mailto:tamapat@zwallet.com">tamapat@zwallet.com</A> )
</I> 
Attention Sir/Madam
I am Mr. Patrick Tama and my sister is Miss Rose Tama,
we are the children of Late Chief Paul Tama  from Sierra
Leone. 
I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to
seek your assistance to transfer our cash of Twelve 
Million Four hundred Thousand United States Dollars 
($12,400.000.00) now in the custody of
a private Security trust firm In Europe,the money is
in trunk boxes deposited and declared as Family
valuables by my late father as a matter of fact the
company does not know the content as money, although
my father made them to understand that the boxes
belongs to his foreign partner. 
Source of the Funds: 
My late father Chief Paul Tama, a native of Mende
District in the Northern province of Sierra Leone, was
the General Manager of Sierra Leone mining
coporation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown. According to my
father, this money was the income accrued from Mining
Corporation's over draft and minor sales. 
Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels
forces of Major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of
ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost destroyed
my country, following the forceful removal from power
of the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
by the rebels. My father had already made arrangement
for his family(talking about)my mother, my little
sister and myself to be evacuated to The Netherlands 
with the CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT he made with a
security firm in Europe through the aid of U.N
evacuation team. 
During the war in my country, and following the
indiscriminate Looting of Public and Government
properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone
mining corporation was one of the targets looted and it was
destroyed. My father including other top Government
functionaries were attacked and killed by the rebels
in November 2000 because of his relationship with the
civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. 
As a result of my father's death and with the news of
my uncle's Involvement in the air crash in January, it
dashed our hopes of survival. The untimely deaths
caused my mother's heart failure and other related
complications  which  later  lead to her death in the hospital
after we had spent a lot of money on her early
this year. Now my 18 year old sister and I are
alone in this country suffering without any
care or help. Without any relation, we are now like
refugees and orphans. 
Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited
in the Security Firm, to this effect, I humbly
solicit your assistance in the Following ways. 
1. To assist me claim this boxes from the security 
Firm as our beneficiary. 
2. To transfer this money (USD$12.4MN) in your name to
your country.
3. To make a good arrangement for a joint business
investment on our Behalf in your country and you, 
our Adviser/ Manager For your assistance, I have 
agreed with my younger sister that 20% of the total 
amount will be for your effort and another 10 % to 
cover all the expenses that may be incurred during the
business transaction, Lastly, I urge you to keep this 
transaction strictly confidential as no one knows our
where about. 
Please as you show your willingness; Forward to us
your full name, address and Tel/ Fax numbers, company
name and address (if any) to me via my private email
address as indicated below, this is for security
reasons as I will only be accessing my private email.
Earnestly awaiting your response. 
Thanks. 
May God bless you as you assist us
Mr. Patrick Tama
