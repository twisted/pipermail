Subject: [Twisted-web] The End of Windows XP Support in Twisted 15.5
Message-ID: <4710057A-06DE-4590-9DD3-49C2F4236615@atleastfornow.net>

Hi everyone,

We've just removed the Windows XP builder from our buildbot. Many thanks for Tom Prince for keeping it online for so long, but right now, we think it's time to retire targeting XP.

Our only current supported Windows platform is Windows 7 x64, with Python 2.7.10, with Python 3.4 and Python 3.5 support coming soon.

Message-ID: <0A3BDE9D-275F-4679-A607-C1DF35C62B89@atleastfornow.net>

Hello everyone!

Hot off the presses comes Twisted 15.5.0pre1, the prerelease of Twisted 15.5, which has been described by some as "totally radical" and "off the wall".

In this release:

- Python 3.5 support on POSIX was added, and Python 2.6 support was dropped.
- More than nine additional modules have been ported to Python 3, ranging from Twisted Web's Agent and downloadPage, twisted.python.logfile, and many others, as well as...
- twistd is ported to Python 3, and its first plugin, web, is ported.
- twisted.python.url, a new URL/IRI abstraction, has been introduced to answer the question "just what IS a URL" in Twisted, once and for all.
- NPN and ALPN support has been added to Twisted's TLS implementation, paving the way for HTTP/2.
- Conch now supports the DH group14-sha1 and group-exchange-sha256 key exchange algorithms, as well as hmac-sha2-256 and hmac-sha2-512 MAC algorithms. Conch also works nicer with newer OpenSSH implementations.
- Twisted's IRC support now has a sendCommand() method, which enables the use of sending messages with tags.
- 55+ closed tickets overall.

As usual, it's available for download -- go here (https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/15.5.0pre1/) to get the prerelease tarballs and the full NEWS file.

Please let me know if you have any issues, as well as if you don't! If everything works well, that's a good thing for me to know :)

Thanks! <3

Fantastic job yet again - 2015 has seen some very exciting milestones and a record number of releases.  Thanks, Amber, for making that happen!

Hi everyone,

Twisted 15.5.0pre2 is now available for download. This includes a bugfix for a regression in 15.5 which prevents Twisted Web's client from doing requests to raw IPv6 addresses.

You can find the new release and the NEWS file at https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/15.5.0pre2/. Please test it! If no more issues are found, 15.5 will release sometime at the end of this week.

Regards,
Amber Brown

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am honoured to announce the release of Twisted 15.5!

The sixth (!!) release in 2015 has quite a few goodies in it -- incrementalism is the name of the game here, and everything is just a little better than it was before. Some of the highlights of this release are:

- Python 3.5 support on POSIX was added, and Python 2.6 support was dropped. We also only support x64 Python on Windows 7 now.
- More than nine additional modules have been ported to Python 3, ranging from Twisted Web's Agent and downloadPage, twisted.python.logfile, and many others, as well as...
- twistd is ported to Python 3, and its first plugin, web, is ported.
- twisted.python.url, a new URL/IRI abstraction, has been introduced to answer the question "just what IS a URL" in Twisted, once and for all.
- NPN and ALPN support has been added to Twisted's TLS implementation, paving the way for HTTP/2.
- Conch now supports the DH group14-sha1 and group-exchange-sha256 key exchange algorithms, as well as hmac-sha2-256 and hmac-sha2-512 MAC algorithms. Conch also works nicer with newer OpenSSH implementations.
- Twisted's IRC support now has a sendCommand() method, which enables the use of sending messages with tags.
- 55+ closed tickets overall.

For more information, check the NEWS file (link provided below).

You can find the downloads at <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted> (or alternatively <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads>) .
The NEWS file is also available at <https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-15.5.0/NEWS>.

Also worth noting is the two Twisted Software Foundation fellows -- Adi Roiban and myself -- who have been able to dedicate time to reviewing tickets and generally pushing things along in the process. We're funded by the Twisted Software Foundation, which is, in turn, funded by donators and sponsors -- potentially like you! If you would like to know how you can assist in the continued funding of the Fellowship program, see our website: https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedSoftwareFoundation#BenefitsofSponsorship

Many thanks to everyone who had a part in this release - the supporters of the Twisted Software Foundation, the developers who contributed code as well as documentation, and all the people building great things with Twisted!

Twisted Regards,

Amber "Hawkie" Brown
Twisted Release Manager, Twisted Fellow
