Subject: [Twisted-web] Telnet server: Detecting CTRL-<key>,
	as happends with CTRL-C
Message-ID: <4FCF6216C629B8429751D4F654DBCBA11DE261@FIESEXC035.nsn-intra.net>

Hello,

I have an application, with Python 2.4 and Twisted 8.2.0.

Can I somehow detect e.g. CTRL-J key presses in:


  class Telnet_simulation(telnet.Telnet)
	-->
      def dataReceived(self, data):

(or elsewhere in code)?


When sending CTRL-C, the dataReceived() is called immeaditely, but when
sending some other combinations, the data can be seen only after Enter
is pressed?
(telnet_Command is called then) But the CTRL-J is not a telnet command,
it should act same way as CTRL-C.

Thank you,

Teuvo

If the `telnet? above is twisted.protocols.telnet, then you should switch
to twisted.conch.telnet.  If it's twisted.conch.telnet, then you should
override `applicationDataReceived?, not `dataReceived? (or use one of the
other mechanisms for hooking into it - subclass and override is one
approach, but there are others which you can find examples of in doc/conch/
examples).

Ah, telnet_Command, I guess you are using twisted.protocols.telnet. :)

Most likely your telnet client is in line editing mode.  This means it
isn't sending data typed in until enter is pressed, so of course you can't
receive it until then.  There are telnet negotiation options which you can
use from the server to ask the client to go into character mode.  You can
see some code which negotiates about linemode in twisted/conch/telnet.py
(search for LINEMODE).  I'm not sure if LINEMODE is the preferred option
for controlling this behavior (I seem to recall there being another one,
but I forget which obsoleted which).

Also, twisted-python@twistedmatrix.com might be a more appropriate list for
this topic, since this is a web-oriented list.

Message-ID: <52eff3410902042244o2184a955l63377476cec95f4b@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm new to Nevow and Athena.
I have rather basic question. How to make athena livepage with livefragment
available from top path '/'.
LivePage has to be created every request, so
site =3D appserver.NevowSite(AthenaLivePageClass())
gives error after first refresh.

Every example shows rend.Page() as a top pages and then for /foo  creates
Livepage:
def render_foo(self,ctx):
      f =3D AthenaLivePageClass()
      f.setFragmentParent(self)
      return ctx.tag[f]



I came up with something like this:
class Index(rend.Page):
 ....
      def child_(self, ctx):
              return AthenaLivePageClass()



I can now refresh, as many times as I want, and every time there is a new
object, but Javascript part doesn't work.
I have bunch 404 errors for javascript code requests e.g.:
http://localhost:8080/799467635f981be6a582cff5f88feb4e/jsmodule/Nevow

Besides that issue, is there any documentation for Javascript classes
Nevow, Divmod and etc ?

Regards,
Peter

I use a static root page that is a rend.Page (i.e. not Athena), then  
use a redirect to the base livepage:

class Root(rend.Page):
     addSlash = True
     def childFactory(self, ctx, name):
         if name == 'main':
             return MainLivePage()
     def renderHTTP(self, ctx):
         request = inevow.IRequest(ctx)
         request.redirect(request.URLPath().child('main'))
         return ''

This Root page will be long lived and a new MainLivePage is created  
for every request. That way the MainLivePage has a connection to the  
browser in the way the Root page couldn't.

If there's a better way to do it, I'd be interested to hear it,
pt.

Hi Jean-Paul!

Ok, that's exactly what I was after, the character mode.
I'll try make the telnet client switch to character mode with IAC + WONT + LINEMODE

Hi,

in my app, the Index-Page is a LivePage (not
rend.Page like your example),
works for me without problems:

class Index(AthenaLivePageClass):
  
    def child_(self, ctx):
        return AthenaLivePageClass()

i think the LivePageClass needs child_ to work as root-page
not the rend-Page.

Regards,
Dominik

Hi Guys,

Do you have any hints how to speed up live page loading time?
How to add compression or caching to xhtml and javascript files?

This is a wide-ranging topic, with possibilities on many levels.

As far as twisted-web itself, my experience is that it can be very rapid
in response.

Your solution may lie elsewhere, but can you be more specific as to your
situation?


Thanks,

Hi George

Yes I know this is a wide-range topic. I have just started developing with
Nevow and I don't have any major problem yet.
I'm on planing stage so I just wanted to know what options I have.
First maybe I would like to know how to compress  response, including
javascript files from Nevow/Athena framework.
After every request to LivePage there are 3-4 additional requests for Nevow
js and I want add my js files too. I
was thinking about using dojotoolkit.org, so I can end up with many js
static files.

Try setting jsModuleRoot to something cacheable if you don't want every
page load to require the JavaScript module sources to be downloaded
again.

Peter,

I have no experience with Nevow/Athena, and you have Jean-Paul
Calderone's advice.

Since you are in the planning stage, I'll offer a technologically
successful example of the use of a Dojo client and a Twisted server:
http://simplemax.net/func.html

The client consists of an HTML page that uses Dojo for several purposes.
For server communication it uses Dojo's implementation of JSON/Ajax.
The server uses twisted web's web.http.HTTPFactory .

Even though the twisted server is hosted on a 2006-vintage 32-bit single
processor machine on a residential network, the rate limiting factor (in
North America) is rendering of the client output, which is throttled
with the 'more output' control on the func.html page.

I haven't used Javascript compression.  When appropriate I design with
an application pattern as in the func.html example above.  This serves
the end of cacheing, often on the screen of the client, reducing the
need for compression.  So I am a bad reference, but here are two
alternatives:


http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html

http://shrinksafe.dojotoolkit.org/


Also, I would point out that using the edge network cache of Dojo is
essential to fast page loading. I use

&lt;SCRIPT TYPE="text/javascript"
SRC="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.2/dojo/dojo.xd.js"&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;

and similar links to the Dojo CSS.  I'm not sure how well this works
outside of North America, however.  There is also an AOL network cache
of Dojo.


Regards,

George

Subject: [Twisted-web] What to use for webDav?
Message-ID: <508711.25652.qm@web35006.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,
  I looked at the info about web development with twisted and was left more than a little confused...   
1. - Which part of twisted should I use for this- twisted-web, twisted-web2, something else..?
2. - is it even possible to do what I want to achieve:

- Provide access to parts of a store of files, the contents of various directories will actually be based
on database queries.

So this sort of thing could work:
/2009/Latest

This way, I can get people using normal file managers, yet really they will be calling down to my
python app to get the listings and links to the files in the end.

The only WebDAV support in Twisted is part of Twisted Web2.  It represents
the largest single chunk of functionality which has no equivalent in Twisted
Web, however the plan *is* to port it to Twisted Web.

Message-ID: <5F77E23F-172D-43F3-8818-D4BFF5C77803@googlemail.com>

I have a system that presents a list of text files for download and  
these files are sat on a unix system. Windows uses are complaining  
about the EOL of these files, so I was wondering if there was a simple  
way to fix it as part of the download.

The files are presented using nevow.static.File(name,  
defaultType="text/plain"). Is there a better mime type that will  
prompt browsers to convert? Or should I subclass n.s.File to convert  
based on browser ID?

Thanks if you can help,
PT.

As far as I know, browsers don't ever do newline conversion.  You'll 
need to write some code to do this.  Subclassing static.File might be 
the way to go.

Please be aware, however, that automatic newline conversion is the cause 
of a long list of data-corruption problems with old FTP servers.  You 
might just want to tell your users to get a text editor that can 
understand UNIX newlines.

Subject: [Twisted-web] Status of the twisted.web HTTP client?
Message-ID: <499E028A.8080108@gmail.com>

I am writing a Twisted-based proxy (http://xuproxy.sourceforge.net/). 
Currently, it is based on twisted.web2, since I started on it before the 
merge of twisted.web2's features into twisted.web, and at the time, both 
the twisted.web client and server were missing features that my proxy 
needed. From looking at the current development tree, it looks like the 
server now has all the features that my proxy requires, but the 
twisted.web client is sorely lacking for my purposes (it's HTTP/1.0 only 
and lacks support for persistent connections).

Are there any plans to merge the full HTTP/1.1 support of twisted.web2's 
client into that of twisted.web?

Yes. JP has been working on an HTTP/1.1 client in:

Subject: [Twisted-web] new http auth stuff
Message-ID: <49A7ED61.2050805@imperial.ac.uk>

All,

The new HTTPAuthSessionWrapper stuff in Twisted 8.2 seems to have a bug. 
Specifically, the 1st component of the URL is thrown away by the 
HTTPAuthSessionWrapper getChildWithDefault method.

So, if I define a resource:

class Page(resource.Resource):
   def getChild(self, path, request):
     if path=='foo':
       return Foo()
     elif path=='bar':
       return Bar()

...then hitting the url:

http://localhost:8080/foo

...just gives me the Page() resource, but if I hit:


http://localhost:8080/ANYSTRING/foo

...I get a Foo()

Am I seeing a bug, or am I using it wrong?

Sounds like a bug, maybe file one with trac, http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/
