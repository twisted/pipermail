Yay Axiom, we all love Axiom.  Except, Axiom isn't an ORM, it's a 
database :).  I don't want people getting the idea that Axiom is a 
replacement for Storm (and similar systems): it's something different.

The difference is that an ORM will allow you to access whatever schema 
you want, perhaps a pre-existing one; a good ORM will let you use 
whatever database you want.

Axiom only lets you use SQLite, and it defines how your schema has to be 
structured, created, managed, and upgraded.  There are queries that you 
can't perform with Axiom which you could perform with Storm.

Most importantly, though, Storm is designed to allow you to have other 
things able to access the same database *without* the benefit of having 
Storm code loaded into them, whereas Axiom requires that certain 
invariants be enforced, and doesn't define them anywhere but the Axiom 
code.  The only safe way to modify an Axiom database is via an Axiom 
program with the appropriate schema.

Of course Axiom has its advantages too, but those are obvious, right? 
;-)
