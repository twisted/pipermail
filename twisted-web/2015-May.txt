Message-ID: <FF06AE8A-9FE3-4C8A-86E3-81C4FA65C63F@atleastfornow.net>

Hello everyone! It's about time that the owl-themed release management simulation kicked into high-gear, and as such, I delivereth to you all the first prerelease of Twisted 15.2.

Bringing not only headlining features but also a lot of incremental improvements, this release has got plenty to like:

- twisted.logger has landed! This is a brand-new, feature-rich logging framework.
- Python 3.4 is now a supported platform for all the Py3 ported modules.
- twisted.trial.unittest.TestCase's assertEqual, assertTrue, and assertFalse methods now pass through the standard library's more informative failure messages.
- twisted.python.filepath.FilePath now supports Unicode (text) paths properly, and includes as{Bytes,Text}Mode methods for interacting with APIs that require a text/bytes-only FilePath.
- twisted.mail.smtp.sendmail now supports ESMTP and provides a high-level interface for sending mail.
- The following parts of Twisted are now ported to Python 3:
    - twisted.internet.process
    - twisted.cred.credentials
    - twisted.python.modules
    - twisted.internet.kqreactor
    - twisted.internet.endpoints.ProcessEndpoint
    - twisted.web.static

As usual, tarballs can be found at http://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/15.2.0pre1/ , and the full NEWS file can be found at http://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/15.2.0pre1/NEWS.txt .

On a personal note, I'd like to thank Tavendo for sponsoring a majority of my Py3 porting work, and everyone who reviewed tickets for getting it landed.

Please test out the new prerelease :)

Twisted regards,
Amber "Hawkie" Brown

Hooray!!!!  This release is a pretty big deal.  This new logging system has been in development for a long time, and the availability of twisted.internet.process on py3 is a pretty big new chunk of twisted.core to be available.

Thank you very much, Amber, for helping us get out timely releases on such a consistent basis.

Reminder, everyone, that you have a week from this announcement to test your software against the pre-release and test any regressions!

(Thanks also to my employer, Rackspace, for giving me the time to review many of these tickets.)

Great news on the release and the ever forward march to more Python 3
compatibility.
I'm finally starting to move over a lot of projects to Python 3.4 and plan
to try moving my first small Twisted project in about three months.
Looking forward to digging in.

Hi everyone!

Twisted 15.2 has some minor regressions in the logging framework. These issues are fixed in 15.2.1, of which this is the prerelease of.

You can get the tarballs and the changelog from http://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/15.2.1pre1/.

Please test it out, and if there's no issues, 15.2.1 will be released before the week's end.

Subject: [Twisted-web] A twisted wsgi success
Message-ID: <CAGNewGSdOa+G1iDPijYY3Y9q20TJ5pt_9B+R3ucF9=8HOC4a=g@mail.gmail.com>

I mostly lurk on here, but I wanted to share my recent experience switching
my company's wsgi container to twisted wsgi.

We had been using a particular wsgi container implemented in C. As time
went on problems creeped up with cython modules, segfaults happened, and
threading had to be disabled. Things that worked in development would not
work in production. At this point I wanted two things: the development
container should be the production container, and the container of choice
should provide a python interpreter environment consistent with actual
python. These containers written in C which treat your application like a
plugin fail to do that across the board.

We no longer have any of the issues we had before (cython, threading,
segfaults), and if something were to break in production, it is probably
broken in development and won't make it out the door. Development servers
run the same twisted wsgi container that runs in production, in fact they
are both launched the same (but middlewares and reloaders differ). That
consistency is a really big deal. Additionally, deployment and config
management dropped a few hundred lines.

The biggest pushback I received was over performance. We benched our real
world application (versus, ahem, just returning a string) and found our
median response time was consistently 1-2ms higher across various
concurrency levels. That's insignificant for us. Under high load, twisted
wsgi actually did better with tail latency (99%ile and max). Maybe that
slight bump in median latency is because our web workers now speak http
instead of a "light weight protocol" akin to scgi, but the benefits of
talking http (curl much?) are also worth a millisecond or two.

Thanks for all the hard work, and thanks Glyph for your 2011 Djangocon talk
and your tweets leading me to twisted wsgi. We're very happy. If anyone
wants details or a peek at some of the wiring, I can probably get approval
to share more.

Thanks very much for your kind words!  Would you be able to fill in more of the details and send a similar message to success at twistedmatrix.com <mailto:success at twistedmatrix.com>?  We can always use more stories of how Twisted made things great for somebody :).

Also, you may be interested in <https://github.com/hangarunderground/hendrix <https://github.com/hangarunderground/hendrix>>, which is taking the Twisted-as-web-application-container thing to the next level.  (I'd like to roll some of their features back into our WSGI container at some point, but in the meanwhile...)

Hi Ian

    Could you tell me a bit your benchmark data? I am interested in moving
our container to twisted recently.

Gelin,

I'm loathsome to share my data as benchmark data. We came up with an
acceptable range of performance before we set out, decided on what to test
and how based on real traffic, and did a very short test to confirm we were
ok. We picked a particular page that hits a few of our internal systems. We
ran the benchmark against 3 twisted processes with default threadpool
parameters vs the other with 8 workers on a single core VPS. We don't care
about 2 or 10 or probably even 50 milliseconds. We didn't bother tuning the
old setup (or maybe we did in the past before I arrived). We really just
wanted to check for a huge, perceptual regression in performance. We were
comfortable enough with this test to use it, but I wouldn't refer to it or
publish it as a benchmark.

With that disclaimer, I've attached a graph of mean and standard deviation
in our particular test.


Run with:
ab -c 1 -n 100
ab -c 10 -n 1000
ab -c 25 -n 5000

I don't know if I have complete output from ab anymore.

Ian,

Thank you for sharing, thank you for doing a realistic test, and thank you for qualifying your results as heavily as they really should be :).  I only wish that more publishers of hype-fest microbenchmarks would be as scrupulous and methodical.

One thing I always feel compelled to point out - 'ab' is a terrible benchmarking tool and the numbers it outputs are, often as not, just completely wrong.  It really is "apache"-bench, meant to work for validating apache configurations, not a general HTTP testing tool.  I have personally had much better success with the very simple "httperf", although there are other tools that are probably better than that.

Subject: [Twisted-web] Twisted 15.2.1 Release Announcement
Message-ID: <EDCB82A4-650B-45DC-AC58-7C13F872126B@atleastfornow.net>

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am honoured to announce the release of Twisted 15.2.1.

This is a bugfix release for the 15.2 series that fixes a regression in the new logging framework.

You can find the downloads at <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted> (or alternatively <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads>) .

Many thanks to everyone who had a part in this release - the supporters of the Twisted Software Foundation, the developers who contributed code as well as documentation, and all the people building great things with Twisted!

Twisted Regards,
HawkOwl
