Any time you have shared mutable state, you have this possibility.  You 
do need to take measures to avoid making one request destroy the state 
associated with another request.
&gt;<i>If this is a danger, then I need to prevent this, which seems to imply

</I>&gt;<i>I will need to block each request and not service another request until

</I>
Serializing (ie, not processing a second request until the first is 
completed) processing is one way to accomplish this.

However, another way to accomplish it is to not have shared mutable 
state.  A quick skim of your code suggests you don't actually have much, 
if any, shared mutable state.

The list holding your database results is a local variable, and each 
request builds its own (as far as I can tell).  There is no danger of 
different requests interfering with each other in this case.
