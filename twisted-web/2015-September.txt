Subject: [Twisted-web] Twisted 15.4.0 Release Announcement
Message-ID: <536D8798-44E2-4C75-AB8F-C6F422ADD32D@atleastfornow.net>

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am honoured to announce the release of Twisted 15.4, codenamed "Trial By Fire".

Twisted is continuing to forge ahead, with the highlights of this release being:

- twisted.positioning, the rest of twisted.internet.endpoints, KQueueReactor (for real this time), and twisted.web.proxy/guard have all been ported to Python 3.
- Trial has been ported to Python 3! This was made possible by a Python Software Foundation grant.
- Twisted officially supports several more platforms: Py3.4 on FreeBSD, Py2.7/Py3.4 on Fedora 21/22, and Py2.7 on RHEL7.
- Python 2.6 is no longer supported, and support for Debian 6, and RHEL6 has been removed because of this.
- Support for the EOL'd platforms of Fedora 17/18/19 has been removed.
- Twisted has moved to requiring setuptools for installation.
- twisted.python.failure.Failure's __repr__ now includes the exception message.
- 19 tickets in total closed!

You can find the downloads at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted (or alternatively http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads). The NEWS file can be found at https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/trunk/NEWS .

Many thanks to everyone who had a part in this release - the supporters of the Twisted Software Foundation, the developers who contributed code as well as documentation, and all the people building great things with Twisted!

Hooray Twisted!  Hooray Amber!

This release is a particularly big deal, because:

If you've been wanting to port portions of Twisted over to Python 3 but have been stymied by primitive tooling and weird special cases, the fact that the full test runner is now available is a big deal.  It should be a lot easier to onboard new contributors to help with porting tickets now, and I expect the rate of porting of Python 3 modules to accelerate considerably as a result.  Thanks to everyone who made this happen.
