Subject: [Twisted-web] Twisted 15.3 Release Announcement
Message-ID: <2B4C122E-4DA0-4743-8D30-B0F419084098@atleastfornow.net>

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Labs, I am honoured to announce the release of Twisted 15.3.

We're marching confidently into the future, and this release demonstrates this:

	* 10+ modules ported to Python 3 (see NEWS for specifics)
 	* Twisted Lore has been removed.
	* Twisted no longer releases as 'subprojects' -- there is only one Twisted, long may it reign.
	* twistd now uses cProfile (instead of Hotshot) as the default profiler.
	* 40+ more tickets closed overall.

You can find the downloads at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted (or alternatively http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads). The NEWS file can be found at https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/trunk/NEWS .

Many thanks to everyone who had a part in this release - the supporters of the Twisted Software Foundation, the developers who contributed code as well as documentation, and all the people building great things with Twisted!

Twisted Regards,

Amber "Hawkie" Brown

Subject: [Twisted-web] Updates on the Twisted Buildbots
Message-ID: <EF5EDAF8-1785-42B0-AA03-AA61520DD402@atleastfornow.net>

Hi everyone,

If you haven't looked at the buildbots for a while, there's been some changes! (for brevity's sake, unsupported builders will be prefixed with a U, eg "U2.7")

- Fedora 17 (2.7), 18 (2.7), 19 (2.7, 3.3), and RHEL6 (2.6) are removed, and replaced by RHEL7 (2.7), Fedora 21 (2.7, 3.4), Fedora 22 (U2.7, U3.4, to be fixed very soon, UPyPy2.4). RHEL6 will return with the 2.7 EPEL soon.
- FreeBSD 10.1 is supported on both Py2.7 and Py3.4.
- OS X 10.6 has been removed and OSX 10.10 has been added (2.7-select supported, kqueue and cfreactor both unsupported)
- Ubuntu 15.04 is now a supported platform (2.7, 3.4) and has unsupported PyPy (2.5) and Jython (2.7) builders.
- All of the builders (excepting Windows) are built and ran in a virtualenv. This means that they have up-to-date dependencies, and if Twisted gains dependencies, the infra team can add them to the build process easily.

Twisted Regards,

Amber "Hawkie" Brown

I am very pleased to announce the release of
The Directory of Twisted Developers at:

http://privacv.com/twisted

Post your resume, answer a few questions, then link to your resume (web
site), or blog.  You can also link to your github, stack overflow,
twitter, email, and facebook accounts.  The other bigger job boards
generally do not allow external links.  You also get to control who has
access to your information.  Unlike the dominant web business model, I
do not sell your information. 

Why my interest in Twisted?  Well, I have been following it for many
years.  I finally have an application for it.  I want to crawl the web,
and Scrapy uses Twisted.  Of course interfacing it to the ZODB looks a
ittle tricky.  I did find zc.twist, very nicely documented, but at first
glance looks way too complicated. 

Feedback on PrivaCV.com/twisted is most appreciated.
Tweets are also appreciated.

Message-ID: <8D500168-E7FE-4EDF-874E-B82E0AB60B89@atleastfornow.net>

Hello everyone!

Another few months, another Twisted release. This one has a few more Py3 goodies in it!

- twisted.positioning, the rest of twisted.internet.endpoints, KQueueReactor (for real this time), twisted.web.proxy/guard, and Trial (!!!) have all been ported to Python 3.
- Twisted officially supports several more platforms: Py3.4 on FreeBSD, Py2.7/Py3.4 on Fedora 21/22, and Py2.7 on RHEL7.
- Python 2.6 is no longer supported, and support for Debian 6, and RHEL6 has been removed because of this.
- Support for the EOL'd platforms of Fedora 17/18/19 has been removed.
- Twisted has moved to requiring setuptools for installation.
- twisted.python.failure.Failure's __repr__ now includes the  exception message.
- 19 tickets in total closed!

As usual, you can find the tarball and newsfile at http://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/15.4.0pre1/ ! Please download them, test them, share them, appreciate them, make them a little nest so that they are comfortable. If there aren't any reported issues, this will be getting a full release soon.

Twisted Regards,

Amber "Hawkie" Brown
