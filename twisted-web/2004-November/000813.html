</I>
Actually I think the current implementation is better since it's
completely unaware of what it is guarding, thus making it really
pluggable and easy to remove.

Probably, a good thing to do is to set as a component the current
avatarId in the session. So that from application code one could say:

ICurrentUser(inevow.IRequest(ctx)).name/login/some_other_stuff

and probably also provide some functionality to set some default
'rememberings' which I currently do with the RememberResourceWrapper

&gt;<i> My rewrite is *much* simpler. It's not as complete as nevow.guard
</I>&gt;<i> although it does work and has the distinct advantage that it does not
</I>&gt;<i> create a session until it's really needed.
</I>
indeed it's far better than current nevow and a lot easier to hack.
 
&gt;<i> Valentino (aka dialtone) recently started patching my version in an
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to bring it inline with the real guard. He's even started
</I>&gt;<i> calling it newguard ;-). I guess this is a case of &quot;watch this space&quot;
</I>
Ehe :), If can get things to work as I want, and get some help from
Tv, newguard should be ready soon. Right now it works fairly well and
it's backwards compatible with old guard.

And, as I wrote in the note inside guard.py, I'm willing to write some
support for database session storage, which will come in handy for my
next university project about distributed systems.
