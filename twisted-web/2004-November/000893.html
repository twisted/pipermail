That's correct, thanks for these exmplanations.

It seems to me that twistd 1.3 (on windows) doesn't remove &quot;.&quot; from 
PYTHONPATH anymore. At least I could not reproduce my problem with 
1.3.0. So for me it now works with just a &quot;.&quot; in PYTHONPATH.

&gt;<i> Also, please at least get Twisted 1.3.0. It's been out for quite a while 
</I>&gt;<i> now.
</I>
Done.

 &gt; If
 &gt; you would be willing to attempt to work through the tutorial and ask
 &gt; questions when things don't work or seem to be out of date, and perhaps
 &gt; update it using the answers provided, I could cut a new version of it
 &gt; and include it in 0.4, prominently linked on the website.

The interesting thing is the set of running examples. Most important is 
(1) that they are running, and (2) that they don't use a completely 
obsolete technique. For (1) I'll try to help.


I am trying to get example4\schedule.py running:

line 8:
-from nevow import rend
+from nevow import rend, loaders

line 13:
-    docFactory = rend.htmlfile('Month.html')
+    docFactory = loaders.htmlfile('Month.html')


... and wow! (an exciting moment when you are discovering something...):
The first page displays!

Next problem: in day.py are two imports who fail:

   from nevow import formless
   from nevow import freeform

Maybe now it's better that I wait for help or comments...
