<PRE>Hi,

thank you for your answer, it's definitely not to long for me ;-)

&gt;<i> Ok, first things first.  The reason I hate &quot;template per segment&quot; designs

</I>&gt;<i> the same illness, which is complexity. Take the following URL:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://myhost.com/foo/bar/baz">http://myhost.com/foo/bar/baz</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This URL identifies a resource, and when some client requests this URL,

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;baz&quot;.  
</I>
Yes, that's how Mason, Myghty and all those do it.

&gt;<i> This enforces a needless dependency upon containment.  Why does
</I>&gt;<i> the resource living at &quot;baz&quot; have to depend upon &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> order to produce a representation of &quot;baz&quot;?  Answer: It doesn't have to,
</I>&gt;<i> and it shouldn't.  
</I>
Please define 'resource' here.

I agree with the 'should not have to depend on' statement if you are 
speaking about programm code, i.e. perl or python objects.

Concerning HTML Fragments or templates, I do not agree. You don't want 
to output a table row (&lt;tr...&gt;) if you are not in a table definition 
(&lt;table...&gt;).

I think it's important do distinguish between those two. I'm not sure 
how to call it: code vs. design, controller vs. view or in your words: 
dependency vs containment.

As of now, I don't know a decent way on how to represent containment in 
nevow. (Yes, there are macros, but...)  I very much agree with you that 
it has nothing to do with (code) dependencies even (OOP) inheritance.

&gt;<i> By imposing this kind of dependency, you are *not*
</I>&gt;<i> gaining the componentization you desire; on the contrary, you've now
</I>&gt;<i> got tight coupling, and changes to the way &quot;foo&quot; is rendered may cause
</I>&gt;<i> problems when rendering &quot;bar&quot; or &quot;baz&quot;.  The longer your URLs get, and
</I>&gt;<i> the more segments you have to render, the greater the likelihood that
</I>&gt;<i> you are going to start breaking stuff each time you fiddle with one of
</I>&gt;<i> your templates.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The same argument applies to acquisition.  In the above example, let's
</I>&gt;<i> suppose that I need to access an object, named &quot;userData&quot;.  Using the
</I>&gt;<i> acquisition model, this means that first &quot;baz&quot; will be searched, then
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;bar&quot;, then &quot;foo&quot;.  If you are lucky, or extremely careful, you can
</I>&gt;<i> code to avoid problems with this, but sooner or later, you will run
</I>&gt;<i> into the situation where more than one resource in the URL has a
</I>&gt;<i> userData object.  When this collision occurs, the userData object
</I>&gt;<i> nearest to the end of the URL will be used.  Maybe that is what you
</I>&gt;<i> want, but maybe it isn't.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Put more simply, the problem with both &quot;template-per-segment&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> acquisition is that they do not scale.  Cannot scale.  Will never
</I>&gt;<i> be made to scale without massive effort on the part of the coder,
</I>&gt;<i> and weren't you thinking that you wanted this model because it would
</I>&gt;<i> be *less* work?
</I>
Your 'scaling' is referring to the amount of human work, right?

Maybe it's not &quot;template-per-segment&quot;, but some form of template 
containment is necessary, IMHO. It reduces the amount of work for 
template designers.

&gt;<i> That said, nevow could certainly use some help in documenting what the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;best practices&quot; are, for building both nevow sites, and nevow apps.
</I>&gt;<i> I have long had good intentions about helping in this area, but I have
</I>&gt;<i> so far failed to find time to do it.
</I>
Well, some people even read mailing lists. So you've already helped 
somewhat!

&gt;<i> That's not a bad idea.  Another idea is to simply stop worrying about
</I>&gt;<i> HTML duplication, and let each URL segment be fully responsible for
</I>&gt;<i> rendering itself, rather than enforcing a meaningless inheritance
</I>&gt;<i> model on what should be a simple resource.  Seriously, URL segments
</I>&gt;<i> show containment, but nowhere is it written in stone that containment
</I>&gt;<i> equals inheritance.
</I>
Certainly URL segments do not equal inheritance in the code. Sometimes 
not even containment on the template level (as in 
&quot;template-per-segment&quot;). OTOH, the URL hierarchy very often resembles 
the template hierarchy (especially for websites).

&gt;<i> WSGI.  This is one that I am virtually certain to be alone on.  The
</I>&gt;<i> fact is, some very smart people came up with WSGI.  Another fact is
</I>&gt;<i> that some very smart people came up with SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, etc.
</I>
Please define 'smart' ;-)

No, seriously, I'm not a fan of all of those, so...

&gt;<i> I find WSGI of little value because, to me, it is just another attempt
</I>&gt;<i> at creating the &quot;lego&quot; model.  Every once in awhile, some smart people
</I>&gt;<i> get together and try to come up with a component model that will truly
</I>&gt;<i> give them &quot;lego&quot; style pluggability.  WSGI is all about saying, &quot;hey,
</I>&gt;<i> choose whatever app server you want, as long as it speaks German. Want
</I>&gt;<i> a session component?  Go ahead, use any one you like, as long as it
</I>&gt;<i> speaks German.  An ORM?  If it speaks German, you're good to go!&quot;
</I>
Oh, I'm glad I'm speaking German :-)

&gt;<i> Seriously, the whole pluggability, freedom-of-choice thing is a bunch
</I>&gt;<i> of nonsense.  Who the hell cares if you can plug stuff together, when
</I>&gt;<i> it all has to plug together in the same way?  Any color you want, as
</I>&gt;<i> long as it is black.
</I>
I guess they are all looking for the most colorful variant of black. ;-)

&gt;<i> Also, I've been using twisted since version 0.9 or so, and WSGI is
</I>&gt;<i> very honest about saying that it doesn't really have anything useful
</I>&gt;<i> to contribute to the async model of web development.  WSGI is really
</I>&gt;<i> great for those people who like threads, and that's great for them.
</I>&gt;<i> For people who prefer async architectures, WSGI will never be a good
</I>&gt;<i> fit.  Note that web2 does support WSGI, but in order to do so, it
</I>&gt;<i> has to give up most of the value of being async.
</I>
I don't want to get into the sync vs async issue now, but it would 
certainly be possible to write an async WSGI-like interface, doing 
similar URL segment processing, content filtering and such. Why should 
such a thing not be great if you consider WSGI to be &quot;great for people 
who like threads&quot; (i.e. sync)?

As you might have guessed, I do not agree with your point of view 
regarding the 'lego model'. I'm surprised to read that &quot;pluggability ... 
is a bunch of nonsense&quot; from somebody who obviously knows OOP, python, 
interfaces, etc.. I don't understand how you came to that conclusion (or 
believe) WRT templates.

Again, thank you for your answer. I very much enjoy discussing such 
design issues.

Regards

Markus
