Man, you definitely need to write more docs, you're good. :-)


&gt;<i> WSGI.  This is one that I am virtually certain to be alone on.

No, you're not. :-)


&gt;<i> The
</I>&gt;<i> fact is, some very smart people came up with WSGI.  Another fact is
</I>&gt;<i> that some very smart people came up with SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, etc.
</I>
And some even smarter people (Roy Fielding) just looked at the Web, and
described it under the REST moniker.


&gt;<i> Seriously, the whole pluggability, freedom-of-choice thing is a bunch

</I>
Well, that's true for any purported standard. The point is, is it a useful
thing?


&gt;<i> Also, I've been using twisted since version 0.9 or so, and WSGI is
</I>&gt;<i> very honest about saying that it doesn't really have anything useful
</I>&gt;<i> to contribute to the async model of web development.  WSGI is really
</I>&gt;<i> great for those people who like threads, and that's great for them.
</I>
No, it's not.


&gt;<i> For people who prefer async architectures, WSGI will never be a good
</I>&gt;<i> fit.  Note that web2 does support WSGI, but in order to do so, it
</I>&gt;<i> has to give up most of the value of being async.
</I>
Exactly, and that's why it's not useful.


&gt;<i> Many people will disagree with my stance on these topics, I'm sure.
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, this rant is so long that many will simply avoid
</I>&gt;<i> responding ;)
</I>
And some others will stand up and cheer. :-)
