Did you find some time to explain already? I'm still curious.

My current project which started all this is almost over now. As you 
might know, I tried to do it the nevow way. And I guess I've come to the 
root of my problem: I'm more looking for a _website_ building system, 
while nevow seems to be a system to build web applications. Which is in 
no way meant to put nevow down, it just has a slightly different focus.

Another thought I've had was: most probably I could come away with just 
having the templates split up. I don't need (and as you have pointed 
out, it's probably dangerous) to split the code behind. One way to do 
that would be writing a docFactory which compiles a template from 
multiple XML fragments.

Anyway, before writing any code I'd love to hear what concepts others 
have in mind. Especially your argumentation against WSGI would be 
interesting for me.

Regards

Markus
