Subject: [Twisted-web] Looking for anyone interested in maintaining treq.
Message-ID: <CA+t4paytbmHme_cahRVO5Sg85uAZr2DTM-kgXxO+e1oi5OtWbw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm starting a new job soon which doesn't involve Python. I also have a
newborn at home so my free time is pretty much spoken for.

If anyone is interested in maintaining treq I'm now accepting applications.

If anyone has an alternative to plug this would also be an OK time for
that.
