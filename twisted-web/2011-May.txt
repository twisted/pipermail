I'm not sure what the list policy on recruiting is so I will be brief.  I
need someone with a ton of free hours from now until June for a commercial
web app.  Please write directly to me, and my apologies to the list.

No apologies necessary.  We don't have a policy yet; I look forward to the day when twisted web hackers are in such high demand that we need to have such a policy to reduce the spam :).

One often-repeated rule I see on lists where this is a problem, though, is that it's polite to mention the name of the hiring company.  I won't say that's a requirement for this list, but I would consider it a courtesy.

Of course the _most_ polite thing you can do is become a sponsor of Twisted and get your logo on the front page... ;-).

Thanks for keeping it brief, though, and good luck on finding a suitable candidate!

Subject: [Twisted-web] serving unicode body in twisted web
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=kx6fCRYz+03MjOhuyeTPXM-zGDQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm having a problem putting binary data into a body of http response
using twisted web.I'm doing something very wrong, any help is
appreciated. The funny thing is that it runs on python2.7, but fails
on python2.5. Most probably it has something to do with unicode/str.

Code snipplet:
-------
def render_GET(self, request):
    # get contents of a binary file, e.g. zip archive
    request.setHeader('Content-type', 'some-mime')
    return content
-----

This results in a error:
....
          File "C:\Python25\lib\site-packages\twisted\internet\selectreactor.py",
line 146, in _doReadOrWrite
            why = getattr(selectable, method)()
          File "C:\Python25\lib\site-packages\twisted\internet\tcp.py",
line 428, in doWrite
            result = abstract.FileDescriptor.doWrite(self)
          File "C:\Python25\lib\site-packages\twisted\internet\abstract.py",
line 199, in doWrite
            self.dataBuffer = buffer(self.dataBuffer, self.offset) +
"".join(self._tempDataBuffer)
        exceptions.UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte
0x92 in position 10: ordinal not in range(128)

Any ideas? I assumed that I can put any contents into http body.

thanks,
Ilja

I'm not sure why you get different behavior on Python 2.5 vs Python 2.7. 
You can certainly put any data you want, including "binary" (that is, 
non-ASCII) bytes.

This error does suggest that a unicode object has gotten into the send 
buffer somehow.  Check to make sure the content you returned from 
render_GET is of type `str` and that all of the header names and values 
that you set are also of type `str`.  A `unicode` object slipping in to 
one of those places is the most likely cause of this problem.

Hi,

thanks a lot for the hint! This was indeed the problem - one of the
headers was in wrong. I have a conditional content-type, one of the
providers returned unicode instance. I guess on python2.7 it behaves
in a different manner.

Just for the archive - solved by adding a bit of debug code in
twisted/internet/abstract.py:doWrite()
            try:
                self.dataBuffer = buffer(self.dataBuffer, self.offset)
+ "".join(self._tempDataBuffer)
                self.offset = 0
                self._tempDataBuffer = []
                self._tempDataLen = 0
            except UnicodeDecodeError:
                err = sys.exc_info()[1]
                print "_tempDataBuffer value: ", self._tempDataBuffer
                print "_tempDataBuffer types: ", [type(x) for x in
self._tempDataBuffer]

Should this perhaps be added as an additional check to Twisted?

thanks,
Ilja

Subject: [Twisted-web] Porting the features of nevow.guard to
	twisted.web.guard
Message-ID: <op.vv5k51pwo3d63n@tiassa.local>

Hi gang,

Per a short chat with exarkun (thanks exarkun), I'm posting this to the  
list for discussion.

A project upon which I am working requires a twisted.web service that  
allows a user to delegate authentication/authorization to a third party,  
e.g., Facebook, Twitter, et cetera.  In so doing, I've found myself  
missing nevow.guard, since web.guard currently only has out-of-the-box  
support for HTTP Auth.  I'd like to see web.guard expand to cover more  
kinds of auth, such as form-based auth or the OAuth-based solutions coming  
 from so many social graph sites.

With this in mind, I asked exarkun about this, and he mentioned that the  
only thing he does not consider to be garbage in nevow.guard is the  
feature-set, and that I should port the features to web, discarding the  
baggage.

I'd like to solicit the list for some guidance as to what those features  
are, or should be, and hopefully end up with a ticket describing the  
features to be implemented, which I will then attempt to implement and  
contribute to twisted.web.

Thanks,

Daniel

Hi, Daniel

I'd very much support having more authN/authZ systems in web.guard.
Ideally, also some support for xacml and nfsv3 acls.

Subject: [Twisted-web] divmod nevow & mantissa status
Message-ID: <4DE57186.2060106@fefaya.com>

Hi,
I'm python newbie and want to use python for my web app.
I have tried to build simple app with web.py, Flask, and tornado.
And i just found twisted.

According to this 
page:http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/WebDevelopmentWithTwisted m 
nevow & mantissa provide higher level framework than twisted-web.
But their pages is not available.
"No Such Resource

File not found."

Any comment?

Thanks
