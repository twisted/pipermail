Subject: [Twisted-web] Twisted 16.3.1 Prerelease 1 Announcement
Message-ID: <FFF8521A-4ACF-48A5-AC53-BBA30BE098E9@atleastfornow.net>

Hi everyone,

I've just uploaded the first prerelease of Twisted 16.3.1, a security & critical bug fix release of the 16.3 series. It contains:

- A bugfix for a HTTP/2 edge case,
- Fix for CVE-2008-7317 (generating potentially guessable HTTP session identifiers)
- Fix for CVE-2008-7318 (sending secure session cookies over insecured connections)
- Fix for CVE-2016-1000111 (http://httpoxy.org/)

You can find the tarball and the full news file for testing at https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/16.3.1pre1/ .

If no issues are found, I will issue a full release by Friday.

- Amber

Subject: [Twisted-web] Twisted 16.4.0 Prerelease 1 Announcement
Message-ID: <907706DC-77A4-4026-9190-7052B0CBE4E3@atleastfornow.net>

In a rare Twisted release double feature right after 16.3.1, I bring you the first prerelease of Twisted 16.4.0.

This is a big release, the first after the Git migration has really kicked in! And so, here's what it brings us:

- twist, a new command line tool for running Twisted plugins, similar to twistd but with a simpler, cleaner interface.
- A new interface for Protocols, IHandshakeListener, which tells Twisted to tell the Protocol when the TLS handshake has been completed.
- async/await support for Deferreds, allowing you to write Python 3.5+ coroutines using Twisted
- Trial can be invoked with "python -m twisted.trial".
- 35+ more modules ported to Python 3, and many many cleanups on the way to Python 3 on Windows support.
- 240+ closed tickets overall.

For more information, check the NEWS file (link provided below).

As usual, it's available for download -- go here (https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/16.4.0pre1/ <https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/16.4.0pre1/>) to get the prerelease tarballs and the full NEWS file. If you want to install it right away, run:

   pip install https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/16.4.0pre1/Twisted-16.4.0rc1.tar.bz2 <https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/16.4.0pre1/Twisted-16.4.0rc1.tar.bz2>

Please let me know if you have any issues, as well as if you don't! If everything works well, that's a good thing for me to know :)

Twisted Regards,
Amber Brown (HawkOwl)

This is a _lot_ of stuff.  I can only imagine what a mega-blockbuster release we are going to have once we have this level of investment but we are already _done_ with python 3 porting (a day which, at this clip, will come soon)!!!

Two minor points:

This release _also_ comes with setuptools console scripts.  That sounds a bit dull, but for those of you on Windows, the exciting consequence of this apparently mundane tweak is that that this is the first release to have programs like twistd (and the new 'twist'!) work properly at a Windows command line, without any special %PATHEXT% configuration!  setuptools/virtualenv/pip's .exe-stub generation makes .exe files that work more or less like regular Windows executables, and therefore integrate much better into the environment for all kinds of purposes.
I'm about to land the fix for <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/8754>.  While not technically a regression, I believe we should have a pre2 for this; it would be sad for our first asyncioreactor release to be beset by random EPIPE tracebacks (even if asyncio itself would be without our help ;-)).

Message-ID: <BAFB7F74-3A23-4F16-9535-778A599B8469@atleastfornow.net>

Hello again everyone,

I bring you a prerelease of the Twisted 16.4.1 security fix release, thus deemed 16.4.1pre1. This release contains:

- A mitigation for SWEET32 (https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/08/24/sweet32/ <https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2016/08/24/sweet32/>).
- The inclusion of ChaCha20 to our TLS cipher suite, providing your underlying OpenSSL supports it.

Please note that the SWEET32 mitigation will break TLS from IE on Windows XP. This shouldn't be an issue for you (hopefully), but if you need to support those poor XP using souls, you can add 3DES back to your CertificateOptions yourself.

As usual, it's available for download -- go here (https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/16.4.1pre1/ <https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/16.4.1pre1/>) to get the prerelease tarballs and the full NEWS file. If you want to install it right away, run:

   pip install https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/16.4.1pre1/Twisted-16.4.1rc1.tar.bz2 <https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/16.4.1pre1/Twisted-16.4.1rc1.tar.bz2>

Please let me know if you have any issues, as well as if you don't! If everything works well, that's a good thing for me to know :)

Have fun, and stay secure!

Twisted Regards,
Amber Brown (HawkOwl)

Hi everyone,

Just a note to say that the HTTP/1 + TLS leaking CLOSE_WAIT sockets issue, fixed in 16.3.2 and 16.4.0, has been assigned a CVE, CVE-2016-7100. It'll start showing up on the various CVE databases soon.

Really looking forward to using 'twist' on all my infrastructure.  This is a great release, everybody!

Message-ID: <CAMcKhMQrx5sH5c=ZQDT4UNeuvLAQLUGfA=+3w=1ZaS4U26pN6w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just released Nevow 0.14.2[1]. The list of changes from 0.14.0[2] is
as follows:

Features

Nevow will now correctly map the MIME type of SVG files even if the
platform registry does not have such a mapping. (#88)
Athena no longer logs widget instantiation on initial page load. (#92)

Bugfixes

Nevow's test suite is now compatible with Twisted 16.3. (#82)
Athena will no longer cause spurious errors resulting from page
disconnection. (#84)
Athena will now ignore responses to already-responded remote calls during
page shutdown. (#86)

Improved Documentation

Nevow's NEWS file is now generated from news fragments by towncrier. (#81)

[1] Available from PyPI, as always: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Nevow/

[2] What happened to 0.14.2? A release engineering mishap during uploading
0.14.1 required rolling a new release; there are no further changes in
0.14.2 from 0.14.1 besides the version number and NEWS.
