I'm on your side here and I would like to make a decision on this feature.

We have 2 implementations:
foom's:
The cache is keyed with the interfaces' values that the cached tag uses 
internally and a new context, that only remembers those selected 
interfaces, is created and passed through the cached tag to render its 
content.
+ very secure
- hard to understand why you should always key with at least 
IRendererFactory

mine:
The cache can be keyed with any object, if you pass a sequence the 
cached tag will be registered for each item in the sequence and the 
sequence itself. An optional scope argument can be used to tell where 
the cached content should be stored (anything that implements ICache can 
act as a CacheStore), by default there are 2 scopes: sitewide (without 
any extra argument passed to t.cached tag) and ISession (which stores a 
cached item per user).
+ easier to understand for a beginner
- less secure and harder to use, since you have to manually provide a 
unique key, when there are many many many cached  items.

Now, I must say that I like foom's idea but it need a bit of tweaking 
IMHO to allow easier use for beginners.
