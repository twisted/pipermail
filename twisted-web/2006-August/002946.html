Yay! ;)

</I>
I'm sure everyone agrees that SSO support would be highly desirable.

&gt;<i> If it did, it would be a lot easier to sell some of the learning  
</I>&gt;<i> required to use it well.  But I think that we could do a lot to make the  
</I>&gt;<i> learning seem easier: once over the initial hump, guard is not hard to  
</I>&gt;<i> use and the conceptual design is very simple.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Absolutely.  The real point I was trying to make is that your &quot;typical&quot;
web developer (yes, I know people hate when I generalize like this) just
wants some mechanism that he/she doesn't have to think about.  Granted,
some people are very uncomfortable using technology that they haven't
read line-for-line, but I'm not one of those.  I actually *like* for
things like authentication/authorization to be black boxes.  Not in
terms of the code, mind you, but in terms of use.  Don't make people
get cred/guard zen in order to feel comfortable using them.

&gt;<i> I think that interacting with it through a slightly higher-level
</I>&gt;<i> system like Mantissa is pretty easy, so some focus on a bit of
</I>&gt;<i> boilerplate to hide some of the more advanced details would be good.
</I>
Yes, this is the black box to which I was referring.  As someone who
uses Mantissa, one of the things that appealed to me was that I did
not have to do anything but create some user accounts, and I didn't
have to even think about guard.  It all just works, and that's the
kind of ease-of-use that is needed.

Of course, my answer is to just use Mantissa, but there seems to be
a fair number of people who only want Nevow, hence this whole thread.

Thanks for clarifying where cred/guard should go.
