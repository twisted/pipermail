<PRE>List,

Using t.web.client.getPage, I am continually seeing a  
&quot;t.i.e.ConnectionDone: Connection was closed cleanly error&quot;  
exception.  The same URL loads fine in Firefox.  I have examined the  
request headers that FF was sending, and even tried emulating  
exactly** all those headers in getPage(..., headers=...), but that  
was no help.  My timeout is set very high as well, so it's not that.

However, in ethereal, the response headers from the server, and in  
fact the content the server was sending back, was identical between  
the FF request and the getPage() request.  The data looks as though  
it's being received, but I still get that exception, and getPage's  
success callback is never called.

Any insights before I dive into HTTPClientFactory?


** the only difference I saw between the two requests was that FF's  
was HTTP 1.1, while getPage's was 1.0.
