1) The client ask to change the password
2) The application ask the old password and the new one
3) do the query:
   UPDATE Accounts SET password=md5(:new_password)
   WHERE password=md5(:old_password)

The application developers can forget to invalidate the &quot;old&quot; session.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, it's the session ID. Let's restate your sentence now then: you said

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is true only when you talk about cookies. Sessions serverside are a

</I>&gt;<i> accessible by the user.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Ok, but sessions cannot exists without cookies (or other solutions to
keep state beetwen successive requests).

The problem is that &quot;GuardSession&quot; are not simply session!
They allow an user who only know the session ID to authenticate into a
system.


&gt;<i> [...]

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, know I'm spending a couple of hours on this topic, but HTTPs will

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Measured in how much loss in performance? How loaded is the server? How
</I>&gt;<i> many users do you have?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It sure will slowdown things.
I still have to do real world tests.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> heavier than nothing, probably true
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> heavier than encrypting/decrypting all cookie values each time? slightly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> heavier timewise? not at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Encryption is not really needed, only signing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But, as you say, HTTPs can be a better solution at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> signing is even heavier than encryption because signing means hashing
</I>&gt;<i> and encrypting (a)symetrically which is what HTTPs does.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Ok, thanks.

&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I think that it will never be commited, since it will involve a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> partial refactoring of Guard.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A new guard version is already there 
</I>
Where? The one in your sandbox?

&gt;<i> and we are about to start the
</I>&gt;<i> biggest ticket in Nevow history... guard is not going to scare anyone
</I>&gt;<i> (hopefully is going to go once web2 is finished).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Ok.
So this means that the development of new guard is goind to happen in
Nevow and *then* ported to web2?

&gt;&gt;<i> The same reason why old file upload support is still there (and there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no control on the size of POST data so someone can send me an image of 3
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MB).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At least I can change this without changing source code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fixing this requires more than a simple refactoring... It's a complete
</I>&gt;<i> overhaul of twisted.web API, which is twisted.web2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Ok.
But now twisted.web2 is not ready.
It will take an year to be usable in production.

I cannot tell Nevow to stop reading long POST data, but I can tell it to
do not parse this data.

As I can see, the big problem is with parsing.


&gt;&gt;<i> I can create a session only to store some state (as an example, to count
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how time an user failed the login).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why it should have a guard attribute?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know that in python everything is by reference? It's not going to
</I>&gt;<i> waste more time and having a reference to guard is useful for
</I>&gt;<i> application level code that wants to mutate a session from
</I>&gt;<i> unauthenticated to authenticated. (this is pretty much the only usecase).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
You can need to initialize some state in your Session.
class ICounter(Interface):
   pass

class CounterSession(Session):
	def __init__(self):
		self.count = 0


sc = SessionManager.getSession(ICounter)


I can now use this simple session to limit logins attemps.

Well, of course an attacker will not use cookies at all...
But I can bind the session to the source IP address, using this value as
session key
(at least I would like to send an email to the site admin when having
100 logins attemps from the same IP address).


&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But you are also supposing that SessionManager creates only one king of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> session.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm supposing that yes. Do you have a usecase besides the one already
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in session.py where you have both persistent and non
</I>&gt;<i> persistent sessions in the same object?
</I>
See above.


&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - If you choose to not create sessions for anonymous users, then there
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  is no more need for the loggedIn callback
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you give me enough reason to remove the loggedIn callback I will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> remove it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it is possible to avoid creating sessions for anonymous users, then a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> session needs only to be created after a successful login.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So you can put the code that is now in loggedIn in createSession.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which doesn't change the fact that createSession is not that easy to
</I>&gt;<i> change while changing loggedIn just requires a subclass and override
</I>&gt;<i> without even going for the upcall if you don't need to, because the
</I>&gt;<i> callback is fairly easy (and that's why it's a callback).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
This is true.

&gt;<i> This is not enough reason anyway. You have to explain why it is a bad idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I don't like the idea to have &quot;authentication only&quot; sessions.
SessionManager (and CookieFactory) is a general class that should not
live in guard.


But, if you say that sessions are *never* to be used except to hold
authenticated states (plus other persistent state, if one want to do
so), then... ok.
