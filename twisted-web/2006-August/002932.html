</I>
This is better. Although 'carry some text used to' is not that good, what would be good is to write that it carries _exactly_.

&gt;&gt;<i> This is a non-problem with my guard. Asking authentication each time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> invalidates the current session credentials (because you changed the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> password in the database when you autogenerated a new one). To reach the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one stored in the session is not valid anymore.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Not sure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>An attacker &quot;authenticate&quot; into the application using a stealed cookie.
</I>&gt;<i>No one is changing/regenerating the password, the attacker only changes
</I>&gt;<i>the account email address and then ask the system to send the
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;forgotten&quot; password to the new (under its control) email address.
</I>
&gt;<i>It needs to execute HTTP commands, and the sessions does not change.
</I>
Given your other suggestions (one of them was store the hash of the password) how are you going to send the &quot;forgotten&quot; password? You don't even know it.

You must autogenerate a new one and then send it, and if it's like that you 'just' lost an account and not a password.

Anyway these suggestions are more part of another chapter that could be
titled: &quot;Suggestions on safe web app design&quot; rather than part of the authentication chapter.

&gt;&gt;<i> sessions are not authentication, of course they are not good for that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yes, sessions carry authenticators.
</I>
What are these and why?

&gt;&gt;<i> They are different kind of things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>No.
</I>&gt;<i>Both cookies, URLs and hidden form's controls are a mean to transport
</I>&gt;<i>sessions IDs.
</I>
Those are _different_ means to transport session ID.

&gt;<i>Do you prefer a fully usable site to a secure one?
</I>&gt;<i>Cookies are standards.
</I>
You still have to show me how it is not secure to use session IDs in the URL. 

&gt;<i>I don't have an e-commerce site.
</I>&gt;<i>Its only a portal.
</I>
You are spending more time here talking about how to make session id exchange more secure while you could have simply used https and that's all.
Doesn't sound very efficient.

&gt;<i>Mea culpa on using the wrong term. Of course I intended persistent.
</I>
persistent sessions are yet another thing and the user asks for the explicitly by ticking 'remember me'.

&gt;<i>I will do some test but HTTPs for every page is likely too heavy for the
</I>&gt;<i>poor server.
</I>
heavier than nothing, probably true
heavier than encrypting/decrypting all cookie values each time? slightly
heavier timewise? not at all.

&gt;<i>Not sure.
</I>
I guarantee you!

&gt;<i>The root resource is created only once, right?
</I>
You decide it.

&gt;<i>And I can do:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>class ChildPage(rend.Page):
</I>&gt;<i>	...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>class MainPage(rend.Page):
</I>&gt;<i>	...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>root = MainPage()
</I>&gt;<i>child = ChildPage()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>root.putChild('a', child)
</I>&gt;<i>child.putChild('b', child)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>server = appserver.NevowSite(root)
</I>
See? You can decide it, although if you did this because it was an optimization you will regret doing it.

&gt;&gt;<i> And this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be enforced without the context. Also... Are you actually worrying
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about creating one object compared to the cost of rendering a dynamic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page? (and locating it!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have learned to not make pre-assumptions without doing some tests.
</I>
well... I did tests and I know what happens during page rendering and page lookup. For each rendering 6 to infinite contexts are instantiated. If you nest more than 5 fragments python reaches the infinite recursion limit (this number might vary, just to give you an example of how many objects are created during rendering). You are removing a:
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-web">dialtone at aiolia</A> /Volumes/dati/Sviluppo/Divmod/branches % python -m timeit -s 'class Foo(object): pass' -c 'Foo()'                                         [17:31]
1000000 loops, best of 3: 1.62 usec per loop

1.62 usec (on my ibook)

over something that is extremely more expensive per se (child lookup).

&gt;&gt;<i> Of course there's nothing that prevents you to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> return always the same page object from guard.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And guard has some (avoidable) security problems, too...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It uses URLs based sessions without my permission.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my who? user? developer?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Developer.
</I>
Can't see that as such a big problem... But it should be configurable indeed, open a ticket.

&gt;<i>Some sites, as an example, bind cookies to user IP address (Yahoo, at
</I>&gt;<i>least some years ago).
</I>
Which is not secure, I can fake it, I might be behind a NAT, I might steal the computer, I might use a computer from an internet cafe` used by someone else before me. How is this going to be more secure? HTTPS is enough.

&gt;<i>Some other personal advice about yout guard implementation:
</I>&gt;<i>- I think that SessionManager should be renamed SessionFactory
</I>
It's not a proper factory. SessionManager is a clean name, it manages lifetimes and creation/destruction. Exactly what a manager does.

&gt;<i>- Maybe the getSession() of the SessionManager class should be changed
</I>&gt;<i>  in getSession(sessionInterface=ISession)
</I>&gt;<i>  That is, ISessionManager should work a little like the
</I>&gt;<i>  ICredentialsChecker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I can define an IGuardSession with additional features (the guard
</I>&gt;<i>  attribute that really make sense only for authenticator's sessions.)
</I>
what's an authenticator's session? This might be useful but seems like a lot of added complexity for a pretty small usecase. Remember sessions are an implementation detail not something that should be exposed to the user. I can't imagine a need for such a generic API.

&gt;<i>- If you choose to not create sessions for anonymous users, then there
</I>&gt;<i>  is no more need for the loggedIn callback
</I>
If you give me enough reason to remove the loggedIn callback I will remove it.
