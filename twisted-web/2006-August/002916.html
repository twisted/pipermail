</I>&gt;<i>But then why store sessions in a database at all?
</I>
Beucase registered users that are logged in and required to be remembered are asking for that. Persistent sessions persist even after reboots of the application something that may happen in 2 weeks time.

&gt;<i>Yes, I know.
</I>&gt;<i>I was searching for an object with the &quot;right&quot; lifetime, forgetting
</I>&gt;<i>about the request.
</I>
context lifetime is ending soon.

&gt;<i>By the way: what's the difference beetwen ctx.remember/locate and
</I>&gt;<i>storing attributes on the context/request?
</I>
Too long and complicated to explain and not worth it. but storing data on the request is always a bad idea. And storing data on the session is mostly a bad idea. Storing data in the database is not a bad idea.

&gt;<i>Sorry, I did not noticed that it was a callback!
</I>&gt;<i>Only a question: sessionwrapper is self.guard?
</I>
what is self? anyway I guess yes, searching for the place where loggedIn is called is a much easier way to find the answer.

&gt;<i>I think that serverside state is not needed here, cookies come for this.
</I>
Cookies come to identify all the requests coming from the same browser, they are not meant to store server side state, although they can keep 32k of data.

&gt;<i>Sometimes one only needs to know the authenticated username (to
</I>&gt;<i>personalize some portions of a page).
</I>
This is something that is already available to authenticated users. I think you mean un-authenticated users here.

&gt;<i>Another use cases can be to have the login and logout page as fixed
</I>&gt;<i>resource (and, maybe, on a SSL connection).
</I>
&gt;<i>This solution needs a custom, but I can reuse your SessionManager interface!
</I>
Not really. You need to change SessionWrapper to do that. And only the locateChild method.
