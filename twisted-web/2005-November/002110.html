Just a comment from the peanut-gallery: As a person who is currently using  
web2, I want to weigh in heavily on the side of &quot;restrict the applications  
of twisted.web2 to object publishing&quot;.  The way in which web2 publishes  
objects fits very nicely with the way Roy Fielding describes REST, at  
least insofar as my understanding of REST goes.

Every Resource *should* be identified by a URL, and that URL *should*  
refer to one logical Resource.  This is how the web works today; I for  
one, hope that it continues to do so.

That said, I'm completely in favor of coming up with sane mechanisms for  
Sessions and Auth.  Changing web2 such that the a singly-rooted tree of  
Resources is no longer the base metaphor should not be a requirement for  
implementing Sessions and Auth.

It seems to me that you'd be much happier with a WSGI solution, wherein  
you can just plug your request-processing, session-handling, foo-handling  
components into the stream at appropriate places.  Web2 supports WSGI  
already, so that might be a better route to take.  Then you can implement  
the model that best suits your application, while leaving web2's object  
publishing model intact for those of us that vastly prefer it.
