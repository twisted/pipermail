I certainly was not contradicting L. Daniel Burr, in fact, I agree with
his position right up-to where he seems to assert that object publication 
systems support REST, while a request handling mechanism doesn't.  

|<i> L. Daniel said &quot;Every Resource should be identified by a URL&quot; -- he
</I>|<i> did not say &quot;one and only one URL&quot;; therefore, his words did not say
</I>|<i> injectivity was a requirement. 
</I>
L. Daniel Burr did not say &quot;one or more URLs&quot; either.  He was vague in
his declaration; and I was hoping to respectfully clarify the definition
of Resource without causing a ruckus.

|<i> Hence, it is needless for Clark to say that no one requires it.  There
</I>|<i> was no such claim.
</I>
Actually, there is a need to make this clarification.  Most object
publication systems assume that each Resource object has a single parent
(that is, that Resources form a tree).   This is a very tempting
assumption to make, but there is nothing in the web architecture which
requires that a Resource have exactly one URI. 

Not that I think this restriction is unreasonable in many contexts. I
don't mind if a slightly-higher-level object publishing system is built
on-top of low-level primitives. However, I don't think that a system
like Twisted should be making this assumption at its most basic level.
The trunk does not yet make this assumption: I'd like to keep it that way.

Kind Regards,

Clark
