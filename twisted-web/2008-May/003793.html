Abhishek,

Forgive me if I have misunderstood, but it sounds like you're not
actually having a problem with a Twisted mail server. Is that correct?
Are you writing client software with Twisted?

If you can provide us with more details about your problem with Twisted
(minimal code examples that demonstrate the problem are best), we might
be able to help you out.

Thanks,

d
