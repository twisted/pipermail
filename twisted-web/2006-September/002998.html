We surely will. In the meantime, I have an urgent request:

*Please fix the wrapping of your emails!*

Many messages in the archives of mailing lists around Twisted and Divmod
require constant horizontal scrolling, and that's very annoying. It's been
this way for *years*, it shouldn't be that difficult to fix Quotient, or
whatever is the cause of this.

Just to be clear, I read your emails perfectly, wrapped and all, via Gmane
and Thunderbird. The point are *the archives*. There's lots of valuable
stuff in there, but: you do a Google search, find a message, and then are
confronted with the pain of horizontal scrolling. There's a good chance
many people will turn away without ever reading them.

In many years of reading mailing lists and newsgroups, the
Quotient-originated emails are *the only ones* exhibiting this problem:
that's why I think it's you that should be fixing it.

Sorry for ranting, this has been getting on my nerves for too long. :-)

Many software developers have become hostage to the development
frameworks that they utilise. In turn, many frameworks have made
session state a fundamental building block of web development
because it permits sloppy design. -- Alan Dean, April 2006
