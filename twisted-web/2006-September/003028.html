<PRE>Hi,

You mean, even though pastebin's RootPage is derived from a Fragment, I 
can't embed it into another Page? This would mean nevow is not component 
based, according to my understanding at least. I can't believe that.

&gt;<i> Otherwise simply return the root page of the pastebin from the 
</I>&gt;<i> child_pastebin method of the root page of your site.
</I>
That does the URL-space-embedding of the pastebin into another page. But 
not the design wise embedding.

&gt;<i> As I told you the first time you should use a dictionary that contains 
</I>&gt;<i> fragments, in fact that's exactly what you should do.
</I>
I know. But, sorry if this seems stubborn, I still don't understand how 
a dictionary of fragments would solve my need to have hierarchically 
organized fragments.

&gt;<i> What you are trying to do is far less dynamic than what you tried to 
</I>&gt;<i> explain.
</I>
Why? I still didn't encounter an example in nevow with fragments 
containing other fragments, deciding which child-fragment to show based 
on the URL.

&gt;<i> Just pass the docFactory argument to the Page class when you create it 
</I>&gt;<i> and let the Fragments render themselves with the appropriate template 
</I>&gt;<i> (when the are needed, and they are not strictly here).
</I>
That does not solve my problem.

&gt;<i> if you only want to change the outer parts of a page then use the macro 
</I>&gt;<i> system (it is _static_ and request agnostic, it's compiled at the first 
</I>&gt;<i> request but has no connection with it (and it's wrong to act in that way).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Use a single macro.html template in your application and write 
</I>&gt;<i> everything else in order to fill the macro slots, when you need to 
</I>&gt;<i> change the macro change it (the macro template is the docFactory of the 
</I>&gt;<i> base Page class, when the rest inherits it will fill the content macro 
</I>&gt;<i> (or sidebar or whatever macro) with its own template that statically 
</I>&gt;<i> depends on the page you are writing in that moment.
</I>
Macros seem far to static and I don't see how they could solve my 
problem neither.

I'll keep trying, as I don't believe nevow is unable to do that.

Regards

Markus
