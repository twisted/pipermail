Subject: [Twisted-web] how to pass html-formatted string to page renderer
Message-ID: <9ce0c1400911050226mb36461dt37e4597edae99714@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to display text loaded from a database. This text is already
html-formatted.
However, when i pass this text to the page renderer, it does not recognize
the html
tags in the text. So the tags are displayed along with the text content.

How do I let the renderer know that what I'm passing is an html-formatted
string
so that the renderer will use the tags in the string.

Regards,
Eric

I'll guess that you're using Nevow and returning such a string from a 
render method.  If that's not what's going on, please clarify.

You can use nevow.tags.xml to wrap an already-marked-up string so that 
further processing is not done to it.

Your protocol knows when it has received something that needs to be acted
on. So the simplest possibility is to have the protocol take the action.

If that's too simple, you can have the protocol call a method on the
factory. So at some point (perhaps in dataReceived) the protocol calls
self.factory.doSomething(). Look at the source of
twisted.internet.protocols.Factory and you'll see that buildProtocol puts a
factory attribute on the newly created protocol instance.  The factory can
then implement the higher level processing. If that's still not suitable,
you can build other options by, e.g., passing something to the factory
initializer that it puts onto protocol instances for the protocol to call
directly.

Take a look at HTTPClientFactory and its HTTPPageGetter protocol in
twisted/web/client.py  for an instructive example.

I'm trying to make a homepage that has a link to a page that was made with
file. The only thing that currently works is the File() page. I have
absolutely no idea how to do the rest (no, its not homework). Here's my
current code:
from twisted.web.server import Site
from twisted.web.resource import Resource
from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.web.static import File


root=Resource()
root.putChild("programming", File("/home/dhaivat/"));

factory= Site(root)
reactor.listenTCP(8080, factory);
reactor.run();

How can I implement the home page?

Message-ID: <678ff0e00911221844o12211e1clfd46baf1586c5f6a@mail.gmail.com>

I need to, given an IResource object that's in a site's resource tree, get
its full URL (in order to generate links to it). Looking in
twisted/web/resource.py, it appears that URL traversal is strictly one-way,
with resources having no idea what their path component is, nor what their
parent resource is.

157         def putChild(self, path, child):
158             """Register a static child.
159
160             You almost certainly don't want '/' in your path. If you
161             intended to have the root of a folder, e.g. /foo/, you want
162             path to be ''.
163             """
164             self.children[path] = child
165             child.server = self.server

If putChild were extended a little bit, it could set some info on the child
whenever it's "placed" into the tree, i.e.

165+       child.parent = self
165+       child.path = path

This would make possible a "getFullPath" method that iterates up the tree to
the root, concatenating the parts with "/".

Does anyone see the value of this, if I were to subject such a patch?
Obviously this is only relevant for statically-routed resources.

Your root is a Resource that doesn't have any content in it. Try putting
the File resource at the top level:

   root = File("/home/dhaivat/")

I tried this first with File("/tmp/index.html"), which didn't work.
Giving it the directory instead of the file did work, and it even
recognized index.html.

You could serve your Django app using twisted.web.wsgi.WSGIResource

You can certainly serve Django with Twisted:

Django on Twisted Web - Using the latest twisted.web.wsgi functionality

I'd be really interested in seeing how you'd integrate serving a Nevow app in the same server...

Hi, I'd like to know if there is any example available of how to use this
module. I've search the web but didn't find something useful.

I've a Nevow app working and I'd like to add user authentication to it.

Thanks!

Subject: [Twisted-web] Reuse twisted.web resources in nevow
Message-ID: <496882.87495.qm@web23302.mail.ird.yahoo.com>

Hi all
my app is entirely writen using twisted.web resources. Now i'm thinking to migrate to nevow,
and i'd like to know is it possible to reuse my old resources inside nevow.
Would it be possible to write a nevow class that render twisted.web resources.
Any examples are welcome.

Thanks!

Nevow Pages basically support this now (although I don't know how 
completely).  If you add a Twisted Web Resource as a child of a Nevow 
Page, Nevow will traverse to the Resource and render it.

Ha! I just realized that exarkun and J.P. Calderone are the same person.
I've been reading the "Twisted Web in 60 seconds" from J.P. and seeing
Twisted Trac comments from exarkun and didn't make the connection. Funny.
