OK, so it's not some Deep Architectural Reason; it's just that &quot;Elements are 
not Fragments&quot;, and they use a slightly different syntax. Thanks for the 
clarification.

I do have one more question on this subject of LiveElements, if you don't mind 
imparting some more wisdom.

When I'm completely stumped by something, I try and grep through the various 
Divmod sources to try and find an idiomatic usage (or even one that 
says, &quot;TODO: We really should fix this one day&quot; :-) ).

One surprising result was that most of the LiveElement-derived classes don't 
generally have a docFactory defined, but rather implement INavigableFragment 
and implement non-GUI 'business logic' (e.g. looking up and storing things in 
a DB), although they do return renderable elements from their renderer 
methods.

An example of this would be the FromAddressConfigFragment class in 
Quotient/xquotient/compose.py

What is the reason behind this approach? My approach has generally been to 
build a bunch of GUI-neutral 'business logic' objects and access these from 
the GUI layer (thereby theoretically allowing the GUI to be changed, blah, 
blah, not that I've ever heard of a successful GUI change, mind.).

I guess one advantage of the approach in the Divmod sources is that you 
minimise &quot;interface duplication&quot;: you don't have client-side JS calling 
server-side LiveElement.doStuff(), which has to call 
BusinessObject.doStuff().

Are there other motives and reasons I've completely failed to think of?

Regards,

Ricky
