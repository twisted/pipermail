Subject: [Twisted-web] Non-Blocking I/O?
Message-ID: <3e06879ab64eab3619fa9448bf0e423f@ontrenet.com>

Hi,
  I currently use Twisted Web as a WSGI container for my Flask 
application.
I'm trying to get good concurrent user requests but running into some 
hiccups.

I see that for each user session that hits my server, twistd creates an 
OS thread. This of course will not scale will with concurrent users.

Is there a better way or perhaps command parameter I can use to support 
concurrent users with something like non-blocking IO which can handle 
thousands of concurrent users.

thanks!
Darren

This behavior is defined by the WSGI specification.  If you don't want this
behavior, you don't want WSGI.

Perhaps you want to write a native Twisted application, perhaps using
klein.  Or you could find one of the WSGI variations that aims to support
asynchronous operation instead of multithreaded operation (but Twisted
doesn't provide a container for any of those).
