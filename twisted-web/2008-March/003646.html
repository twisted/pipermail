</I>&gt;<i> You should read
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/WebDevelopmentWithTwisted">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/WebDevelopmentWithTwisted</A> if you
</I>&gt;<i> haven't already.
</I>
Yes, I've read that, but it's pretty general rather than detailed.  For
example, when I read &quot;I want to write a REST / WS-* interface to my
Twisted application: In this case your best bet is to use Twisted Web
directly. Porting to Twisted Web 2 for these kinds of applications will
be fairly trivial (changing a few imports, method names).&quot;  I remember
reading this a long time ago, and it wasn't clear whether anything had
changed recently or how distant these changes were.

&gt;&gt;<i> Is Twisted Web 2 close to becoming stable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not unless a lot of qualified people discover a lot of free time in the 
</I>&gt;<i> near future.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is it an active project (most of the tickets I saw on Trac were a year or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> two old)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, sort of.  There really isn't a lot of manpower available.  But it's 
</I>&gt;<i> not dead.
</I>
That's not the most reassuring answer I could have expected. :)

&gt;&gt;<i> How is its support for HTTP 1.1?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is an HTTP 1.1 server.  What else do you mean?
</I>
Stability and interoperability were the main things I had in mind.  How
well have the server and client been tested against other clients and
servers out there?  Does it make it easy to deal with persistent
connections?

&gt;&gt;<i> How complete is XMLRPC support on both client and server?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't personally know, but isn't XMLRPC kind of trivially simple by 
</I>&gt;<i> design?  I've never heard of anyone having difficulty with XMLRPC support 
</I>&gt;<i> in Twisted.
</I>
It is indeed simple, but just because something is simple doesn't mean
it works well. :)  Your second statement answers the question, though.

&gt;&gt;<i> Is there anything that Twisted Web is still better at than Web 2?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted Web is still quite a bit faster.  It's also simpler.  It might have 
</I>&gt;<i> fewer bugs, just by virtue of having been around longer and being more 
</I>&gt;<i> widely used.  On the other hand it might have more bugs because there has 
</I>&gt;<i> been less enthusiasm to work on it.
</I>
That is very useful information.

&gt;&gt;<i> I've written some code that uses Twisted Web, and it seemed a little
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> basic.  For example, I had to make some modifications in order to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receive large files in progress instead of waiting until they were done
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> downloading.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice if you would contribute those modifications as a patch and 
</I>&gt;<i> sheperd it through the process of being merged.  If more people did that 
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps the project wouldn't be so stagnant :).
</I>
It's a chicken and egg sort of thing.  When things seem quiet, you're
not sure if your patch will be appreciated. :)

In general, I'd be happy to submit this as a patch.  There's a change
I'd have to make first, though.  I wouldn't want to be ashamed of my
submission.  I'll bring that up in a new thread.

&gt;&gt;<i> I have a new project that would use a lot of HTTP and XMLRPC, and I was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wondering if it would be safer to go with Twisted Web or Twisted Web 2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt you'll have any serious problems with either one.  Unfortunately 
</I>&gt;<i> there is no clearly correct answer to your question at this point, but if 
</I>&gt;<i> you make the &quot;wrong&quot; decision, it shouldn't be terribly difficult to port 
</I>&gt;<i> your code to the &quot;right&quot; one later.
</I>
That's very helpful information.

&gt;&gt;<i> I was also wondering if there are any recent or forthcoming advancements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to look forward to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would avoid anticipating any work on the part of the Twisted team.  I 
</I>&gt;<i> think that it's safe to say we are universally overworked.  There's lots of 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff we'd *like* to do, but not a lot that we're really able to :).
</I>
I know the feeling. :)

&gt;<i> I'd also like to fold in large parts of Nevow and get rid, at the very 
</I>&gt;<i> least, of Nevow's application server components.
</I>
From my perspective, the most compelling thing about Twisted is the
ability to use it within other programs.  I find the low-level protocols
more uniquely useful than higher-level frameworks, especially in the
face of competition with large projects like Django.

Thank you very much for your feedback.  My questions were intentionally
open-ended, and you did a fine job answering them.  Thanks.
