I can see why IConsumer would be more appropriate than IProtocol, but
I'm entirely unconvinced by the arguments that IStreamingRequestHandler
would be better than IConsumer.

To start with, I don't understand what an IConsumer has to do with an
IResource.

&gt;<i> That said, here's where I see IStreamingRequestHandler as better than
</I>&gt;<i> re-using an existing interface like IProtocol or IConsumer:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * IConsumer is a very general interface.  It provides no clues about its

</I>&gt;<i>    deduce that if an IResource is also an IConsumer that uploads will be
</I>&gt;<i>    streamed to it instead of delivered all at once at the end.  On the
</I>&gt;<i>    other hand, IStreamingRequestHandler can have documentation which
</I>&gt;<i>    describes its purpose and behavior.
</I>
I didn't understand this.

&gt;<i>  * IConsumer has existing semantics.  There's no reason an existing
</I>&gt;<i>    IResource implementation might not already be an IConsumer as well,
</I>&gt;<i>    for a completely unrelated reason.  If it suddenly starts to receive
</I>&gt;<i>    streaming upload data, it will almost certainly break.  On the other
</I>&gt;<i>    hand, IStreamingRequestHandler is a new interface, so it cannot be
</I>&gt;<i>    misinterpreted.
</I>
If you have to consume two different things, shouldn't you have two
objects?


&gt;<i>  * IConsumer isn't actually sufficiently expressive for this case.  It
</I>&gt;<i>    would be quite useful if the resource had a chance to look at the
</I>&gt;<i>    request headers before streaming begins (okay, I didn't bring this up
</I>&gt;<i>    earlier, so it may have seemed like IConsumer was sufficient).  On the
</I>&gt;<i>    other hand, IStreamingRequestHandler can have a method which takes the
</I>&gt;<i>    request as an argument.
</I>
In my opinion, if you need to be looking at request headers before
streaming begins, you're not doing simple streaming, and you should be
hooking in at a lower level.

&gt;<i> It may be the case that the right method for IStreamingRequestHandler to
</I>&gt;<i> have, though, is one which takes the request and returns an IConsumer to
</I>&gt;<i> which the request body will be streamed.
</I>
All of the IStreamingRequestHandler stuff sounds more complicated than
necessary.  I think I'm convinced that IConsumer is a good way to go.
It uses existing mechanisms to do something simple.
IStreamingRequestHandler, however, would create new mechanisms to do
something complicated.
