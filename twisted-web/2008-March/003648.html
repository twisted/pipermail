You should have said you wanted reassuring rather than accurate - that's 
not my default mode :).
&gt;<i>Stability and interoperability were the main things I had in mind.  How

</I>
Well, twisted.web, like I said, has been around for an aeon or two and I 
know it's been tested against a lot of things.  Apple uses web2 in its 
DAV calendar server, so I assume that's been tested against some non- 
browser clients.

We have no automated interoperability testing though.
&gt;<i>It's a chicken and egg sort of thing.  When things seem quiet, you're
</I>&gt;<i>not sure if your patch will be appreciated. :)
</I>
Your patch might not get *accepted* but don't mistake that for a lack of 
*appreciation*.  :).  Our quality standards are very high these days and 
you can expect a lot of discussion and some push-back (a lot of push- 
back if you don't have unit tests) but we definitely appreciate every 
contribution.
&gt;&gt;<i>I'd also like to fold in large parts of Nevow and get rid, at the very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>least, of Nevow's application server components.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From my perspective, the most compelling thing about Twisted is the
</I>&gt;<i>ability to use it within other programs.  I find the low-level 
</I>&gt;<i>protocols
</I>&gt;<i>more uniquely useful than higher-level frameworks, especially in the
</I>&gt;<i>face of competition with large projects like Django.
</I>
The worst thing about the current web confusion is that I think Twisted 
would be that much *more* powerful if projects like Django could build 
upon it; being the common lower-level of django, zope, cherrypy, 
turbogears, and whatever else, would draw a lot of interest for Twisted, 
and eliminate the need for the &quot;don't use this piece of crap in a real 
deployment&quot; webservers that many of those projects currently come with.

However, I wasn't talking about turning Twisted into some kind of Rails 
clone.  Nevow's templating would be handy for implementing &quot;native&quot; web 
server features that want to produce some simple HTML (like eliminating 
the god-awful hack we currently use for directory listing), but the main 
thing I'm talking about is eliminating Nevow's duplication of basic 
Twisted web-server features (it has its own resource traversal, its own 
Site object, its own static.File...).
&gt;<i>Thank you very much for your feedback.  My questions were intentionally
</I>&gt;<i>open-ended, and you did a fine job answering them.  Thanks.
</I>
No problem.
