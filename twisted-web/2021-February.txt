Subject: [Twisted-web] Twisted 21.2.0 Release Announcement
Message-ID: <CAG=rPVd9XCmAziMZS7NOKffL1NJQ3tsqGf3hy1=pQ2S-FF7oYg@mail.gmail.com>

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am honored to announce the
release of Twisted 21.2.0!

There are two major announcements for this release:

- *Python 2.7 support has been dropped*.  Twisted 21.2.0 supports Python
3.5.3 and higher only
- *This will be the last Twisted release to support Python 3.5*.

Twisted 21.2.0 brings the following:
- twist dns --pyzone now works on Python 3
- twisted.web.twcgi now works on Python 3
- all tests pass on all platforms on Python 3.8, including asyncio tests on
Windows
- tests pass on Python 3.9 (thanks to Michał Górny)
- type hints, as specified in PEP 484, are now used in functions throughout
the codebase
- mypy (static type checker) is now run over the codebase during CI to help
detect problems, and help improve the use of types
- code in is now formatted with Black (thanks to Tom Most)
- many CI and automation improvements (thanks to Adi Roiban and Thomas
Grainger)
- many more fixes (225 tickets closed!)


You can install by running this command:

      python -m pip install Twisted==21.2.0

The full tarball is available at:

You are welcome Adi!

I am happy to contribute my efforts to the Twisted community and to push
the project along.

In 2015-2016, unfortunately I lost my job.  While in between jobs, I
contributed a lot to the effort
to port Twisted to Python 3.  It was a very enjoyable experience, and I
learned a lot of Python at the time. :)

I joined the Python 2 porting party late, and there were others who
invested a lot of time and effort into it.
Amber did a heck of a lot of work before me on Python 3 porting, and did a
lot of work after I contributed.
I don't remember who else contributed, but there were a lot of folks
including you, Jean-   , Glyph, and others.

The earliest Python 3 ticket I can find in the Trac is this one from 14
years ago filed by Itamar!!

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2484

Honestly, at the time, when I was working on Python 3 porting in 2016, I
wasn't even sure that Twisted
would survive as a project beyond Python 2.

So it is nice to see that Python 2.7 is history, and the Twisted codebase
is incorporating new language
features, types, etc. and is keeping up with newer Python versions.

Hurray!
