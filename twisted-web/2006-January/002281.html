formless is already a different directory isn't it? Isn't that enough?

I was talking about the repository not the directory. There's a
directory already: Nevow/nevow, Nevow/nevow is where nevow sits. I'm not
saying forms should be under the nevow directory, but in Nevow/forms.

</I>
Why should you obsolete formless? It's yet another package depending on
nevow. It won't get development, it won't get the latest features, but I
see no need of obsoleting it if there are project depending on them.

Backwards compatibility matters. It matters in python as much as it
metters in twisted and nevow. It's not like python provides backwards
compatibility and nevow can not.

It all depends if you're interested in growing the twisted/nevow user
base or not, if you break stuff without any good reason to break stuff,
the userbase will walk away to ruby on rails or some other project.

I'm not talking about the internals, if my cache patches breaks that's
fine, it's a feature not a bug, but if my app breaks that's annoying.
