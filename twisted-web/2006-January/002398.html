<PRE>They say it's better to say nothing and be thought a fool.  Allow me to 
demonstrate as I recklessly jump into an already overheated discussion.

It's been interesting following the list for the last week or so.  Andrea's 
served, consciously or not, as a pretty fair Devil's Advocate.  I've always 
looked forward to what the movers and shakers on the list will make out of 
the latest bug up his... bonnet.  It's a credit to the list that things have 
remained as civil as they have, and that his concerns have been given as much 
attention as they have.

But it's starting to get old.  There's got to come a time when one has to just 
laugh, tussle his hair, and say, &quot;Oh, that Andrea.&quot;  Surely that time has 
come by now.  For instance, and do correct me if I'm wrong, I think he's 
admitted in passing to not having used unit tests before.  Like everything 
else that has come up which he isn't familiar with, he later dismissed them 
as pointless.  How long can this sort of &quot;that's not the way Mom does it&quot; 
criticism be taken seriously?  Andrea seems determined to find an answer to 
that question.

Mike.
