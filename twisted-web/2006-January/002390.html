Unstable doesn't mean broken. Writing unittests might be boring but it's
absolutely required for projects developed by more than 2 people. And the
linux kernel shows how this is true quite well, and I also understand why
unstable is equal to broken for you.
Not counting the &quot;many&quot; rewrites that happen in the kernel each release.
We don't have 200-to-1000 developers regularly payed by international
corporations. Considering the free time we have and how many things are in
twisted (and I've yet to see a project in any language being as complete as it
is) I could say that the development is even fast.
Nobody has always committed unittests together with fixes but still this is
wrong and it's not yet another reason to insult the others' work especially
when what you say is false.

The rest of the post is pure FUD and trolling so I won't consider it.

I'm sorry to say this but... given your latest behavior I'd be happy if you
stopped using twisted at all since you are actually harming the community
instead of making it better. Maybe more time spent on unittests, bug trackers
and documentation or source code could have done better than the last 10-15
emails.
I'm sure that the ever crashing cherrypy web server will serve your pages
better and faster until it will crash for deadlocks. &lt;g&gt;
