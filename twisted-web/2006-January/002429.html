It was basically a followup to this:

	<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2006-January/012357.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2006-January/012357.html</A>

Furthermore axiom seems to be considered seriously from the twisted
community. See the homepage: <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/:">http://twistedmatrix.com/:</A>

	Australian Twisted Sprint 2005.2 (2005-08-07)
	
	A Twisted Sprint will be held in Sydney Australia on the 19-21 August
	2005. Topics will probably include documentation, a VFS layer (including
	WebDAV support), the new Axiom database, and whatever else anyone can
	think of. For more information, please see the Australian Twisted Sprint
	Wiki. Thanks to Linux Australia for funding this sprint.

I assume some people seems to believe axiom is a good thing to use, some
may even think they can port over a real dbms later if sqllite doesn't
scale.

Note that if you designed the API in a way that had a slight chance to
work with a real dbms without requiring changes to all queries, I
wouldn't be dismissing it as worthless.

I provided an example that showed some of the problems axiom currently
would have, the object of the post wasn't axiom, but I taken the
opportunity to mention axiom given it was so relevant for such db
workload (and also given others from divmod mentioned axiom on these
lists).

Now that I've told my opinion on it, I promise not to mention it
anymore. Also note, my opinion can change, if the code (notably the API)
changes too.

Thanks.
