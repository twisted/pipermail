That is not a unit test.

And if you don't care if things keep working, that's okay. However,  
people generally _do_ like things to continue working. That's what  
unit tests are for. The logging code has worked in the past, but, as  
seen by the brokenness currently existing in svn, not having a test  
means someone may break it and nobody may notice. That's bad.  
Wouldn't you like to fix that?

</I>
Fixing a bug without adding a test makes things slightly better, but  
fixing a bug *and* adding a test makes things much better. It'd be  
nice if you could help out by writing a test, even though it doesn't  
currently exist. However, even without that, yes, the bugfix will be  
made. Thanks for reporting it.

However, committing a new untested API to trunk makes things overall  
potentially worse not better, as it increases the likelihood of bugs  
being added unnoticed. Yes, I've been guilty of doing this, but it's  
not a _good_ thing.
