Let me clarify my position - unit tests are not required for commits to Twisted.Quotes.  If you have a patch to that file we will evaluate it purely on its humorousness and relationship to the various individuals who contribute to Twisted on a regular basis.  I apologize for not having previously stated the official requirements for inclusion in the quote file in a public forum outside of IRC.

Seriously though, are you *trying* to convince us all that you are the biggest jerk in the world?  First, you tell Divmod what we are and aren't allowed to do with our own code.  Then, you waste a bunch of our time because you won't allow anyone to tell *you* what the requirements are for getting code included in Twisted.  Finally, you tell the Twisted team what we can and can't do with our free time.  Perhaps you have become confused and you believe you are in a managerial position because you, or CPUShare, have recently contributed a large sum of money to the Twisted team.  Let me assure you that you that you are not - I just checked my paypal account, and it has nothing to say about you.

Wasting our time and pissing us off with repetitive posting of (mostly  incorrect) opinions to a mailing list is not quite the same thing as the Twisted developers getting together to have a good time on IRC.  If you want to spend your time chatting with *your* friends on IRC (or even on AIM or MSN!  Twisted supports all these protocols!) please, be my guest.
