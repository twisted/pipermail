I was just an opinion on using FormKit on top of web2 (w/ or w/o Nevow,
I use Cheetah instead of Nevow but you could use FormKit with Nevow too,
that's exactly why the library approach is nice, you use what you
prefer, each tool does its job).

I asked because another option would be FormEncode but FormKit looks
simpler to use.

Apparently Subway = Cheerypy+Cheetah+FormKit+SQLObject, that's
very similar with my current planned model:
twisted.web2+Cheetah+FormKit+psycopg2 (I prefer writing the sql by hand,
my apps aren't that simple to be able to ignore sql). So looking the
similarity with Subway for everything related to html rendering, I think
this could be a good choice after all. (btw, it's not exactly clear to
me if Subway uses FormKit or FormEncode, I think they tried both, and
now they use FormKit, the dates on some webpages weren't easy to find)

FormKit is so simple that it doesn't even have a install script, I had
to copy in site-packages by hand ;). FormEncode has an install script
but it's so bleeding edge that I had to upgrade and copy stuff around to
install it, and then it complained about some dependency so I failed to
produce html with it yet, while formkit examples are strightforward of
course. I like obvious simple things, so I couldn't find anything
better than FormKit yet to replace formless.

&gt;<i> think the latter is very likely.  As you said, FormKit doesn't depend on 
</I>&gt;<i> anything except Python, so there doesn't seem to be any reason to bundle it.

Yep agreed.
