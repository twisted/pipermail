I recall I tried this but nevow can't handle nesting. Perhaps I
misunderstood. Anyway the above is certainly more complicated for me to
read and maintain than the below strightforward Cheetah syntax. I don't
want to deal with data=&quot;&quot; render=&quot;&quot;, pattern=&quot;&quot; render=&quot;data&quot; anymore. I
don't even get the point why data and rendering are provided with
separate callbacks (I already told this once I recall). You may like it,
but I don't, I never did, and it's just yet another complication.

&gt;<i> &gt; #for $currency in $currencies
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	&lt;table&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #for $entry in $currency

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [..]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 		&lt;td&gt;$entry.something&lt;/td&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [..]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 		&lt;/table&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #end for

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #end for

</I>&gt;<i> And yes, Nevow is not perfect. Now you are starting insulting the others' work
</I>
Saying that Cheetah is much better, isn't insulting Nevow. I didn't say
Nevow is bad, I'm saying Cheetah is much better and I'm going to switch
to it completely. Nevow was the best I known until Paul made me pay
attention at Cheetah too.

&gt;<i> Nevow then fine, but your recent rants seem to grow from something else than
</I>&gt;<i> technical problems. See? That's exactly why after some point, and I speak for
</I>
They are technical problems, I complained in the past many times about
the slow performance of nevow. This is also why I wrote those caching
patches, to try to workaround those problems.

&gt;<i> Z. Nobody is paying me to work for them on what they want, I have a job,
</I>&gt;<i> university to finish and some free time that I want to preserve. If you
</I>&gt;<i> disagree then step in or pay some of us to work on

</I>&gt;<i> library/framework evaluation before starting with your life's project and you
</I>&gt;<i> can't blame anyone because you made that evaluation wrong even if you are now
</I>&gt;<i> frustrated.
</I>
I am not blaming anyone, really. Infact I wouldn't even blame myself.
It's not your duty to maintain formless or nevow or twisted, this is a
best effort and I appreciate it. I learnt a lot from you btw, I owe you
a lot. My move away from nevow has nothing personal with anybody, it's a
technological move.

Infact if something I was sticking with nevow so long despite the
inefficiency and the complexity of its machinery also because I greatly
appreciate the help you gave me. And the main reason I was sticking with
nevow wa formless. What made my life easier wasn't nevow but formless.
Infact klive almost didn't increase in size after moving from nevow to
Cheetah. This means I was nearly not using nevow at all (except for the
templates rendering that is more efficient and IMHO much simpler with
Cheetah). So if I miss formless I can remove the dependency on nevow as
well at no additional cost (modulo the guard that IMHO belongs to web2 ;).

I quickly noticed the rendering bad performance and I posted profilings
a few times and I started to work on caching code to workaround it. I
mostly gave the blame to the interface code (all CPU time is spent
there, I measured it several times). It's not like I'm complaining only
now, I complained the performance from the day zero, and now I've fixed
it in a definitive way with Cheetah.

I understand that formless is too simple for developers to appreciate
it, you want to play the fancy AJAX, I understand that, fine with me, so
I'm already getting depreactionwarnings, and I'll soon switch to Cheetah
and web2 completely. Riding the wave of the eye-candy isn't my
objective, I want a decent look but I stay away from the new
fast-changing eye-candy technologies and effects as much as I can.
Nevow is diverging in a direction that collides with my interest.

&gt;<i> And now we start with FUD. Just to show you don't actually understand nevow
</I>&gt;<i> you are saying something plain false. Nevow never recompiles templates unless
</I>&gt;<i> you modify them. It parses and precompiles templates once.
</I>
It wasn't FUD, I was talking about Cheetah not nevow. Sorry for not
being clear. Cheetah isn't precompiled, so it re-reads them every time
(so here probably nevow is theoretically more efficient, but in practice
Cheetah renders stuff much faster even if it doesn't cache it).

&gt;<i> Now to put an end to this: I don't think I'll have the time to keep answering
</I>&gt;<i> in this thread, both because I've lost any interest in this thread and because
</I>&gt;<i> It's clear that you simply don't like Nevow which is fine, but I beg you not
</I>&gt;<i> to spread any more FUD.
</I>
I'm posting this, so people that may have similar needs to mine, may
consider Cheetah as an alternative to use on top of web2. I'd like to
create a web2 + Cheetah effort with those potential users. that's one
reason of talking about it here. After all this is the twisted-web list,
it's not called twisted-nevow, so my emails on web2+Cheetah are
definitely on-topic. I'm sorry if you're not interested.

I'd like to teach Cheetah to learn what a deferred is. I think such an
effort could benefit greatly from your help and the help of the
twisted-web community. That way I could stop using #block... that would
cleanup a few lines of code away.
