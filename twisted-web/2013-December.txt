Subject: [Twisted-web] Streaming MP3 using twisted matrix
Message-ID: <1386537699.86303.YahooMailNeo@web120302.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

I'm looking for a simple example that streams MP3 over http.?

I know how to Google, and even to use GitHub search but while I found several examples for using python I didn't find anything using twisted.

Any help would be appreciated?

Thanks,
Yoni

You don't really need to do anything special.  If you have a .mp3 file on your filesystem, a static.File (the thing you get from twistd web --path ...) can "stream" the mp3 just fine.

If you don't just mean serving up a file without chewing up OS resources like PIDs or thread stacks, you'll have to be more specific about what you mean by "streaming MP3".
