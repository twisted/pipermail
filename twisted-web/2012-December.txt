Subject: [Twisted-web] Does twisted-web 12.01 support proxing HTTPS with
	ProxyAgent ?
Message-ID: <CAAZV0TzdG+sX2Aid6Of7uk5Zcz1Eqt53Js6B5Wp2s1LtB8FKMA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

The code suggests it does - but I can't get it to work.

class ProxyAgent(_AgentBase):
    """
    An HTTP agent able to cross HTTP proxies.

    @ivar _proxyEndpoint: The endpoint used to connect to the proxy.

    @since: 11.1
    """

    def __init__(self, endpoint, reactor=None, pool=None):
        if reactor is None:
            from twisted.internet import reactor
        _AgentBase.__init__(self, reactor, pool)
        self._proxyEndpoint = endpoint


    def request(self, method, uri, headers=None, bodyProducer=None):
        """
        Issue a new request via the configured proxy.
        """
        # Cache *all* connections under the same key, since we are only
        # connecting to a single destination, the proxy:
        key = ("http-proxy", self._proxyEndpoint)

        # To support proxying HTTPS via CONNECT, we will use key
        # ("http-proxy-CONNECT", scheme, host, port), and an endpoint that
        # wraps _proxyEndpoint with an additional callback to do the
CONNECT.
        return self._requestWithEndpoint(key, self._proxyEndpoint, method,
                                         _parse(uri), headers, bodyProducer,
                                         uri)


The "Using a http proxy" -
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/web/howto/client.html  works,
provided the target url is http ( not https as shown in the example ).
I'm attempting to adapt this example to confirm https proxing is possible

from twisted.python.log import err
from twisted.web.client import ProxyAgent
from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.internet.endpoints import TCP4ClientEndpoint

def display(response):
    print "Received response"
    print response

def main():
    endpoint = TCP4ClientEndpoint(reactor, "localhost", 8000)
    agent = ProxyAgent(endpoint)
    d = agent.request("GET", "https://example.com/")
    d.addCallbacks(display, err)
    d.addCallback(lambda ignored: reactor.stop())
    reactor.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

I've tried changing the endpoint to SSL4ClientEndpoint without success.

Any help, much appreciated

Hi,

Congrats on getting started with Twisted Web.

This question isn't easily understood or answered.  "How" they work is 
completely and concisely defined by the source code, which you can read. 
I suspect this isn't really the answer you're looking for, though.

Take a look at http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html and 
http://sscce.org/ and then please feel free to ask another question.

Jean-Paul

Subject: [Twisted-web] Twisted 12.3.0 released
Message-ID: <50DAF9D2.3030702@free.fr>

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am pleased to announce, in
extremis, the release of Twisted 12.3.

161 tickets are closed by this release, with the following highlights:

 * Support for local parallel testing in trial

 * A new "react" function to easily run a single asynchronous function
in a script with the reactor.

 * Partial support for Python 3.3.

Note that only Python 2.7 is supported on Windows now. We also require
zope.interface 3.6.0 or newer.


For more information, see the NEWS file here:

 http://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/Twisted/12.3/NEWS.txt


Download it now from:

 http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/T/Twisted/Twisted-12.3.0.tar.bz2 or

 http://pypi.python.org/packages/2.7/T/Twisted/Twisted-12.3.0.win32-py2.7.msi


Thanks to the supporters of Twisted via the Software Freedom Conservancy
and to the many contributors for this release.

Thomas

Thanks for managing another great release, Thomas!!

This doesn't make the feature sound quite as exciting as it is :).  For those of you who didn't know this was coming - as of Twisted 12.3.0, you can run 'trial -j 16 ...' if you have 16 cores and finally make use of all those idle cores during Twisted-based development.
