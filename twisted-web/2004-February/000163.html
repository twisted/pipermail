Nevow doesn't do weird stuff like that. :)

My first inclination would be to suspect that your controller's 
&quot;self.model&quot; isn't the same model as you think it is. I'm not sure if 
Controller is supposed to set self.model to the containing model?

If that's actually supposed to work, then the problem probably has 
something to do with too much copying, caching, or adapting of the data 
(as woven tends to do). But, if that's the case, I don't know what to 
suggest to solve it, other than &quot;don't use setSubmodel&quot;. Or maybe 
&quot;don't use woven&quot; :)
