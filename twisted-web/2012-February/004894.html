I don't understand what this means.  It sounds like you're saying you 
have to have CustomerRestService be a leaf resource.  You don't have to. 
If you don't want it to be a leaf resource, don't make it a leaf 
resource.  The way you not making it a leaf resource is by not setting 
`isLeaf = True` on it.
&gt;<i>That isn't a very good design...especially if you maybe have 50 
</I>&gt;<i>different
</I>&gt;<i>entities hooked up  under '/customer' (like in our app).
</I>&gt;<i>It seems in order to enable having nice cohesive classes that provide a
</I>&gt;<i>REST service for just one entity I would need to manually
</I>&gt;<i>route the request from the root Resource into each of them myself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>That is what i was trying to avoid, but it looks like there is no other
</I>&gt;<i>choice.
</I>
I still don't understand the problem you're having.  As I said, 
regarding the &quot;solution&quot; I gave in my previous email, it's just how you 
would achieve the behavior I thought maybe you were trying to describe 
wanting, but I don't really understand what you're trying to accomplish 
or why.
