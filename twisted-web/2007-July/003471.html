No, we use the term &quot;avatarId&quot; on purpose, to distinguish from other 
common ideas about &quot;username&quot;.  It doesn't necessarily match any 
significant input to your system, nor any particularly interesting data 
on the back-end.  It will be a string, but it might end up just being 
the str() of an integer primary key in a database somewhere.

The fact that this differing from the visibly obvious &quot;username&quot; is so 
rarely is unfortunately confusing, and treating it as a username is a 
convenience that many, many deployments can count on, but should not be 
a core assumption of Twisted Web or Nevow.
&gt;<i>Anyway, never mind - I get the idea - the page is the avatar and should
</I>&gt;<i>be acting on the users behalf. I don't *agree* with the idea, but I get
</I>&gt;<i>it.
</I>
This is certainly a controversial idea, and one that is frequently 
criticised, often in this manner.  Although I don't *agree* with the 
criticism, I don't object to it ;).  Its design rationale should be 
better documented, and for that I apologize.

However, although you may want a &quot;user object&quot; that is different than 
the page -- and in that case the top-level page should probably wrap 
that object -- the term &quot;avatar&quot; has a specific meaning.  To be an 
avatar for HTTP, you must implement IResource.

You can disagree about whether this is the most generally useful design, 
but it *is* the specific design to which the jargon term &quot;avatar&quot; refers 
in the context of cred.  Trying to re-define it so that it doesn't mean 
that makes an already confusing topic even more difficult to discuss. 
So please don't.
