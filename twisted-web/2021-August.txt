Subject: [Twisted-web] Migration to Python Org Mailing Lists hosting
 announcement
Message-ID: <CAFycZ9cxL1FY0nHPxXMQ-kxO_xa2Gwpnz+bKkyUs2YDghp_KRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This is a quick message to let you know that the current mailing list
service will migrate
from the Twisted own hosted services to the mailing list service
provided by the Python organization.

The migration is scheduled to start on the 5th of Augusts, 2021
17:00 UTC time (10:00am PDT / 18:00 BST)

The following email address will no longer be available:

    twisted-web at twistedmatrix.com

The new address will be:

    twisted-web at python.org

The new archive will be hosted at https://mail.python.org/archives/

All existing subscribers will be migrated.

If you only interact with the mailing list using your email
you only need to update your existing filters
and update your email contact address for the list.

The migration is expected to take about 3 hours.

After the migration, Glyph plans to implemea an email redirection,
so even if you will send emails to the old address we should still receive them.
Subject to availability :)

We also plan to redirect the old mailing list pages and archives to
the new pages.
This will also happen after the migration.

Have a nice day... and talk to you soon on the new mailing list.

PS: while we do the migration you can still get in touch using
       IRC on Libera #twisted channel
       Matrix/Gitter at https://gitter.im/twisted/twisted
