Hi Jean-Paul; thanks for your quick answer.

OK, I guess I'll just have to bite the bullet. Adding something to sys.path is 
not such a big deal.

&gt;<i> I wouldn't be happy to see a solution that required declaring all

</I>&gt;<i> use-case for LivePages involves my not having any idea what most of the

</I>
Oh, really? That's interesting. How does Athena push new Javascript code to a 
page after the initial render? I didn't even know it was possible to do such 
a thing: for me, Javascript has always been something you link to from the 
page header. Looks like my 4th Edition &quot;JS Definitive Guide&quot; (2001) is 
showing its age :-)

&gt;<i> The idea is to provide a package hierarchy, as Python has.  The strings
</I>&gt;<i> will be split on &quot;.&quot; in a couple places, but if there is simply no &quot;.&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> them, this will work (since it is equivalent to any top-level name in an
</I>&gt;<i> arrangement which does use dotted names).  The goal of dotted names is to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid polluting the top-level namespace more than necessary.
</I>
You're talking about Javascript's top-level namespace, right? (I assume these 
strings never go anywhere near Python's namespace). OK, that sounds logical; 
I was just wondering whether there was anything more to it that.

&gt;<i>  For sanity's
</I>&gt;<i> sake, I would define classes in a module as attributes of that module,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than using arbitrary other names
</I>
Hmm, I'm not quite sure I understand what you mean in this context. I *think* 
you're talking about JS classes, but the terminology is Python terminology.

If the former (JS classes) do you mean, you'd prefer to have a single (or a 
few) javascript file(s) and have these define the JS for *lots* of related 
LiveElement classes, which all declare themselves to be a (namespaced) 
jsClass, and all these jsClasses map to the same physical JS file?

In other words, for project &quot;Cutlery&quot;:

# In Python LivePage stuff:

class Fork ( LiveElement ):
    jsClass = u'Cutlery.Fork'

class Spoon ( LiveElement ):
    jsClass = u'Cutlery.Spoon'

class Knife ( LiveElement ):
    jsClass = u'Cutlery.Knife'

# In Python plugin code:

jsModules.mapping = {
  # Note: the same file!
  u'Cutlery.Fork' : 'cutlery.js',
  u'Cutlery.Spoon' : 'cutlery.js',
  u'Cutlery.Knife' : 'cutlery.js',
}

# In the file cutlery.js:

Cutlery = {};

Cutlery.Fork = Nevow.Athena.Widget.subclass ( 'Cutlery.Fork' );
Cutlery.Fork.methods ( ... );

Cutlery.Spoon = Nevow.Athena.Widget.subclass ( 'Cutlery.Spoon' );
Cutlery.Spoon.methods ( ... );

Cutlery.Knife = Nevow.Athena.Widget.subclass ( 'Cutlery.Knife' );
Cutlery.Knife.methods ( ... );

Is this what you mean?

Actually, I have a couple more very quick questions that I thought up while 
typing this:

- Am I right in thinking that no athena JS files ever need to have declare any 
of the modules mentioned in BOOTSTRAP_MODULES (e.g. Divmod, Nevow.Athena)?

- Is there a recommended way for LiveElements to access each other on the 
server? For example, I click on an element of (client-side) Foo that invokes 
a method on (server-side) Foo; this then needs to update the state of 
(server-side) Bar, which needs to update (client-side) Bar. At the moment I'm 
using an manual ad-hoc registry, with the occasional (naughty?) 
obj.fragmentParent thrown in. I was wondering if there was a more robust 
method already in place that I had totally missed (like the LiveElements 
being assigned names upon creation, which can then be automagically found 
through something like page.findElementByName ( &quot;Bar&quot; )).

Regards,

Ricky
