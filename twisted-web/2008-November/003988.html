I think we really agree for the most part.

&gt;&gt;<i> - k threads that each have their own reactor
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a whole other, almost unrelated can of worms.  You can only use  
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted from one thread at a time.  There are things which make  
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions about non-reentrancy and mutual exclusion of global module-  
</I>&gt;<i> level state.  You can find and fix every instance of this if you want,  
</I>&gt;<i> but don't bundle it in with multiple reactors :).
</I>
Now that you mention that, I have noticed that a few times when reading
Twisted code.  I think that long-term, it's nice to remove global
module-level state wherever possible, but in the meantime, just putting
the above paragraph in the docs as a warning is probably sufficient.


&gt;&gt;<i> If I wanted to be constantly told &quot;you can't do that, it's impossible&quot;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wouldn't be a Python guy.  If I want to shoot myself in the foot,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that's my problem.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another bogus argument.  There are lots of things that are &quot;impossible&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> in Python.  For example, you &quot;can't&quot; change the values of a tuple, or  
</I>&gt;<i> the contents of a string.  I mean, there's terrible stuff you can do  
</I>&gt;<i> with ctypes, but if it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.  Similarly,  
</I>&gt;<i> there are lots of things that already kind of work, by accident, if you  
</I>&gt;<i> instantiate multiple reactors; you can kind of re-set a reactor if you  
</I>&gt;<i> know exactly what to twiddle.
</I>
Let me rephrase that, then.  I think that in Python, the goal is usually
to create a flexible API and to document how it should be properly used
rather than creating barriers to stop people from doing something just
because it might be a bad idea in some contexts.


&gt;<i> When I say it's nice to be able to say that something's impossible, that  
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't mean that I don't want to support all the reasonable use-cases,  
</I>&gt;<i> just that boundaries are a useful tool.  This is very much the Python  
</I>&gt;<i> idiom - consider your options for indenting your code in strange ways,  
</I>&gt;<i> for example :).
</I>
Again, I think we agree for the most part.
