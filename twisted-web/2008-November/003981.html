I've always struggled with reactor being a singleton.  It makes it very
difficult to use Twisted on a small scale in a larger existing project.
Sometimes it would be really nice to stop a reactor and later start
another one.  Unit testing is one of several situations where this can
be a problem.

I suppose this wouldn't be quite as severe of a problem if it were easy
to restart a stopped reactor, but even then, it would be nice to be able
to have two threads that each have their own reactor.  But I guess I'm
just ranting now. :)
