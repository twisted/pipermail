Thanks.  I must have missed the link earlier.


&gt;<i> On the other hand, the approach you're describing here, using Twisted  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;just a little&quot;, starting up a reactor and spinning it in some obscure

</I>&gt;<i> which should be avoided as much as possible.
</I>
I agree that it should be avoided as much as possible, but I don't think
that it should be impossible to do.  Suppose, for example, that you are
refactoring a project to use Twisted.  It's nice to be able to use it
just a little, then iteratively add more to it.  I agree that you
shouldn't stay in this state long, but it sure would be a nice crutch
during refactoring.


&gt;<i> I can definitely think of a few &quot;larger projects&quot; - names withheld to  
</I>&gt;<i> protect the guilty - whose designs have been influenced and  
</I>&gt;<i> rehabilitated by their decision to use Twisted.  I worry about making it  
</I>&gt;<i> easier to throw Twisted into a situation where it will make the overall  
</I>&gt;<i> design of a system into even more of an incomprehensible mess.  Just  
</I>&gt;<i> imagine trying to decipher a GUI project using Twisted for networking,  
</I>&gt;<i> where there are 3 or 4 different global reactors, each of which is used  
</I>&gt;<i> by a different window or dialog box, and you have to figure out which  
</I>&gt;<i> one you need based on what context your Twisted-using code is running  
</I>&gt;<i> in.
</I>
Give me any API, and I can create a program that misuses it. :)

I'm guessing that the GUI project would be much more decipherable if
instead of having 3 or 4 global reactors, there were 3 or 4 reactors
that were nicely encapsulated.  Anyway, if there's a good reason for
having 3 or 4 reactors, I'm sure there's a good way to organize the code
so that things don't get out of hand.

I think the following use cases for mutliple reactors outweigh the
potential risks:
- starting and stopping a reactor multiple times, particularly for
  testing
- making it easier to refactor existing code to use the reactor pattern
- k threads that each have their own reactor

And I'm sure we could come up with others.


&gt;<i> It's nice to be able to say &quot;you can't do that, it's impossible&quot;, when  
</I>&gt;<i> someone asks how to set up something like that.
</I>
If I wanted to be constantly told &quot;you can't do that, it's impossible&quot;,
I wouldn't be a Python guy.  If I want to shoot myself in the foot,
that's my problem.  :)
