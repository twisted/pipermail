<PRE>I just read through this whole thread and don't understand why no one has
raised suggested running your &quot;little bit of twisted&quot; in another process.
That gives good separation, no multiple thread or singleton issues and
should be quite controllable and it breaks any GIL issues that might come up
as a freebie too.  Of course as you get past dipping your toes in it'll be
rather difficult, but so will anything else.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is almost certainly true, and as I've already said I am keenly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interested in de-globalizing the reactor myself; making it easier to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; test things is a key reason for doing so.  However, we should be aware
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the risks and try to mitigate them.  It could well be that we could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; come up with an API which is smooth as glass for the &quot;good&quot; use-cases we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have in mind here, and raises exceptions or emits helpful warnings when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used for the &quot;bad&quot; ones.  Maybe that's not possible, maybe we can only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get halfway there: but it would be nice to try.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we really agree for the most part.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - k threads that each have their own reactor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is a whole other, almost unrelated can of worms.  You can only use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Twisted from one thread at a time.  There are things which make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assumptions about non-reentrancy and mutual exclusion of global module-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; level state.  You can find and fix every instance of this if you want,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but don't bundle it in with multiple reactors :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that you mention that, I have noticed that a few times when reading
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted code.  I think that long-term, it's nice to remove global
</I>&gt;<i> module-level state wherever possible, but in the meantime, just putting
</I>&gt;<i> the above paragraph in the docs as a warning is probably sufficient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If I wanted to be constantly told &quot;you can't do that, it's impossible&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I wouldn't be a Python guy.  If I want to shoot myself in the foot,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that's my problem.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another bogus argument.  There are lots of things that are &quot;impossible&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in Python.  For example, you &quot;can't&quot; change the values of a tuple, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the contents of a string.  I mean, there's terrible stuff you can do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with ctypes, but if it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.  Similarly,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there are lots of things that already kind of work, by accident, if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instantiate multiple reactors; you can kind of re-set a reactor if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know exactly what to twiddle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me rephrase that, then.  I think that in Python, the goal is usually
</I>&gt;<i> to create a flexible API and to document how it should be properly used
</I>&gt;<i> rather than creating barriers to stop people from doing something just
</I>&gt;<i> because it might be a bad idea in some contexts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When I say it's nice to be able to say that something's impossible, that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't mean that I don't want to support all the reasonable use-cases,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just that boundaries are a useful tool.  This is very much the Python
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; idiom - consider your options for indenting your code in strange ways,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for example :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I think we agree for the most part.
