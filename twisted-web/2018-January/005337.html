<PRE>Hi,

Since I have a couple of projects building on nevow that I'd like to
keep maintaining into the post-python2 world (and at least one of
them contains a broader user base that I can't easily get to port
templates and such), I've started porting nevow to python3.  What's
on <A HREF="https://github.com/msdemlei/nevow">https://github.com/msdemlei/nevow</A> runs essentially all the unit
tests that weren't broken on python2 except for those related to
livepages.

I've not tried to port any python2 code to this now, though, since I
find the current situation where lots of byte strings leak
through from twisted.web quite unsatisfying.  I've tried to formulate
something like a preliminary policy in
<A HREF="https://github.com/msdemlei/nevow/blob/master/doc/strings_and_bytes.rst,">https://github.com/msdemlei/nevow/blob/master/doc/strings_and_bytes.rst,</A>
but I'm deeply unhappy about most of this.

Ideally, I'd like to fairly exclusively expose actual strings to
nevow client code unless they actually deal with binary data (as in
static.File, and of course request.write needs to be able to deal
with this).  This will probably mean isolating client code from
twisted.web.Requests a bit more.

So: 

(1) Is anyone else still interested in this?

(2) Is anyone at all interested in the livepages stuff (I'm not, and
dropping it would certainly make porting and maintaining the package
a lot easier)?

(3) If I went ahead with this and actually tried to get a
python3-nevow into Debian (which I'd really, really like to see): How
is everyone's feeling about keeping the name nevow even if serious
functional changes (such as dropping livepages) were to come about?
[What I care about most is keeping the templating system including
the render_ and data_ methods].

Thanks,

         Markus
