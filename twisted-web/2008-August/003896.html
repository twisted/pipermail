That's what I was referring to. Apologies for the brevity, I was typing 
on a phone handset at the time ;o)

Broadly, caches are perfectly legitimate in HTTP, and it's legitimate 
for subsequent HTTP requests to come from different IPs (hell, NAT could 
in theory cause that to happen).

So, tying the IP into the authentication is, generally, a bad idea.

Something like Digest HTTP auth is the &quot;safe&quot; way to secure an HTTP 
session - you can even (though I've not seen this commonly uses) re-use 
the digest session ID as a server-side key into application session storage.
