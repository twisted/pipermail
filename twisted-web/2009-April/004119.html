<PRE>&gt;<i> It seems like the need for this tool could have been obviated if &quot;twistd
</I>&gt;<i> web&quot; had better support for composing plugins of its own. &#160;I'd encourage you
</I>&gt;<i> to look at 'twistd web --help' and see if maybe some future release can
</I>&gt;<i> provide all the functionality you want.
</I>
Yes, I think that it would be able to do the same things.  The only
unknown is whether it would be easy to use.  I think if you added an
rc-file type thing for the web plugin, it would work quite nicely.
The more I think about it, the more I like it.

This turned into four bugs:

* #3752 to add the composable command line options
* #3753 to add the overlay resource infrastructure
* #3755 to add a proxy/reverse proxy option
* #3756 to add simple configuration files

If twistd web and twisted.web had those four things, it would totally
rock my world and there would not be a need for Tape.

&gt;<i> HTTPFactory should take a FilePath-like object (not a file-like object,
</I>&gt;<i> since it may need to control when the log is opened and closed.
</I>
#3757

&gt;<i> _openLogFile is specifically documented as being for overriding in
</I>&gt;<i> subclasses, yet it's private. &#160;That doesn't make much sense. &#160;Luckily the
</I>&gt;<i> interface is broken anyway, so when we switch over to using a FilePath we
</I>&gt;<i> can switch.
</I>
#3758

&gt;<i> While we're at it, twisted.python.logfile should really be updated to use
</I>&gt;<i> FilePath as well, rather than direct os.path operations.
</I>
#3759

&gt;<i> The CLF-formatting logic really ought to be separated from the code that
</I>&gt;<i> decides to actually write it to a file. &#160;Off the top of my head it really
</I>&gt;<i> seems like this should be a method on Request, but a free function would be
</I>&gt;<i> fine too.
</I>
#3760

&gt;<i> In addition, there's this bug:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/75">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/75</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> which is maybe too vague to actually be actionable, but I think the idea was
</I>&gt;<i> to publish Request objects with a custom format string via
</I>&gt;<i> twisted.python.log.
</I>
I updated #75 to point to the other 4 bugs.

&gt;&gt;<i> * log() never gets called when a ReverseProxyResource is used. &#160;It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appears as though request.finish() is never called, though I wasn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to fully track this down. &#160;I find this behavior very odd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This one's an existing bug:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2677">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2677</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please feel free to attach commentary.
</I>
Done.

&gt;<i> &#160;* In the long term, static.File really ought to compose in a FilePath, not
</I>&gt;<i> inherit from it. &#160;I don't know if it's possible to salvage static.File in
</I>&gt;<i> its current state; I think we need a new static-content class that generally
</I>&gt;<i> works the right way.
</I>
I'm not sure I'm the best person to write this bug.  Perhaps you could
do a quick brain dump into a ticket so it doesn't get lost.

&gt;<i> &#160;* The parameters to __init__ should obviously be documented.
</I>
#3761

&gt;<i> &#160;* createSimilarFile should be documented.
</I>
#3762

&gt;<i> In Nevow and web2, locateChild allows you to consume multiple segments at
</I>&gt;<i> once. &#160;The plan has always been to port these to twisted.web, but I can't
</I>&gt;<i> find a ticket for that plan.
</I>
#3763

&gt;&gt;<i> * ReverseProxyResource returns nothing if you don't give it a '/' at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the end. &#160;I had to work around this by doing a redirect in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subclass and then returning a new ReverseProxyResource when the ''
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> child is accessed. &#160;It seems that if ReverseProxyResource's path is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> '', it just keels over with no error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This could do with a bit more detail (mostly about what &quot;keels over&quot; means),
</I>&gt;<i> but certainly sounds like a valid bug.
</I>
Fair enough.  The server literally hangs up the connection without
returning any response.

#3764

Thanks for your help; it was certainly useful to help me file better reports.

jack.
