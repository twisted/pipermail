Chris has already basically set the record straight here, but for future 
readers I just wanted to have a direct reply to this message and clear 
up a very unfortunate choice of acronyms.  Some of this is a summary of 
other things that have already been mentioned in this thread.

I definitely do not discourage the use of twistd for this purpose :). 
In fact I strongly recommend it.  Here's the history.

&quot;.tap&quot; (&quot;Twisted Application Pickle&quot;) files, and the associated &quot;mktap&quot; 
(&quot;make twisted application pickle&quot;) command-line utility, are strongly 
discouraged.  They've been deprecated for a long time, and they'll be 
gone soon.

&quot;TAPs&quot; (&quot;Twisted Application *Plugins*&quot;) were originally plugins for 
&quot;mktap&quot;.  That's why the naming is similar.  However, *they are now 
plugins for twistd*, and have been for some time.  Developers are 
strongly encouraged to use this interface, and to read the document 
linked above.

Before &quot;TAPs&quot; were plugins for twistd, the suggested configuration 
mechanism for twisted applications was to write a '.tac' file and tell 
your users to edit it.  Processing twistd's commandline arguments at 
this point was impossible without gratuitous hacks, so tac files were a 
better alternative.  However, as Jack noted, editing tac files is 
inconvenient, so we added the twistd plugin interface.  We now recommend 
that adding command-line arguments to your 'twistd' plugin is the way to 
go if you want run-time configuration for your twisted server 
application.

The technique that Chris suggested elsewhere in this thread, to set up 
correct command-line arguments for your plugin and then call twistd's 
run() function, is the currently supported way to invoke twistd's 
functionality from your own scripts.  This is what we use to support 
Divmod's &quot;axiomatic&quot; command, which is basically a database-configured 
version of &quot;twistd&quot;.  A more expressive API for a wider variety of use- 
cases is forthcoming, but this technique should still work even once 
such an API has been added.

The document in question would really benefit from some updating; in 
particular, it would be good to move the mention of TAP files to some 
kind of endnote rather than being mentioned before the actual relevant 
features.
