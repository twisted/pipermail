I was wondering if I could get clarification on the anticipated  
problems with using twistd to run non-daemonizing CLI applications.

It seems like you'd just need to return some kind of custom Service  
from makeService, which would call your app's main() from  
startService, and then call reactor.stop() when your app is finished  
doing whatever it needs to do.

Then you could still use twistd's logging and other goodies, as well  
as parsing your own command line with t.p.usage.

Add a quick one- or two-line shell script to hide the twistd part of  
the incantation, and it seems pretty good.

Maybe there's another issue I'm not thinking of, though...
