</I>&gt;<i> So we have Woven, Nevow, web, and web2. &#160;It's a giant mess.
</I>Totally agreed, FWIW.

 &#160;It's
&gt;<i> unclear to users which thing is the current thing,
</I>I was this user a couple years ago.  I knew that twisted had so much
more greatness that just web, but others may not.
I personally kept with it, which has paid off huge dividends.


although there has
&gt;<i> been quite a bit of everyone pointing to twisted.web lately. &#160;They all
</I>&gt;<i> have their own problems, and it's not clear to me that backwards
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility is a great thing here. &#160; The problem space is well
</I>&gt;<i> understood now, or at least better understood than several years back,
</I>&gt;<i> and most of these were designed beforehand. &#160; Let legacy users add
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;from twisted.legacy import web&quot; and let's make something actually
</I>&gt;<i> useful in its place.
</I>Yes, please!


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I love about twisted.web is that for the most part, it's
</I>&gt;<i> extremely simple and easy to work with. &#160;I should note that it's
</I>&gt;<i> awesome that I was able to write a small proxying web server in so few
</I>&gt;<i> lines. &#160;It's just slightly frustrating that it is plagued by all these
</I>&gt;<i> little issues.
</I>Agreed++
