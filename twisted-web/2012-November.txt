No, you can use Autobahn with Twisted Web

https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/tree/master/examples/

=> websocket/echo_site

and with WSGI (i.e. Flask)

https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/tree/master/examples/

=> websocket/echo_wsgi

Both does work with TLS and also supports not only Hybi-10+, RFC6455,
but also Hixie-76 variants of WebSocket.

No, the testsuite is a side project for Autobahn. Autobahn was designed to
provide first-class WebSocket client and server support for Twisted.

The testsuite has evolved into a "quasi industry standard": most projects
use it to test for protocol compliance.

Autobahn also provides RPC and PubSub on top of WebSocket: http://wamp.ws/.
This is an officially registered WebSocket subprotocol and has
implementations outside Twisted .. including 3rd party ones.

Tobias

Subject: [Twisted-web] Override File's DirectoryLister?
Message-ID: <CAF-ggVOpa_The_qf4Wd3tEtY3ph_X3c30qExG_TD7dxS6tLp0g@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

Thanks again for the answers to my earlier question about overriding the
DirectoryLister class. They worked perfectly. I can tweak and style the
appearance as desired. One more question:

Within of the display of a directory's contents, I would like to have the
ability to have a form that lets me add a file to that directory.

To do this, I added a <form method="post"> to the template of the
DirectoryLister with an <input type=file ...> to specify the file and
created a render_POST() function within my subclass of File.

But the render_POST() function doesn't seem to be called when I click
Submit. I suspect that I'm misunderstanding the class hierarchy, but don't
know what to change. Any advice?

Many thanks!

I think I've answered my own question. I think the "twisted way" is to have
a separate URL and chunk of code for handling these posts. Thanks.

Hi Rich,

You can certainly do that using the same URL and resource.

The "triage" of the function depending on the method (render_GET, render_POST, etc) is done by the Request class.
Since DirectoryLister is a resource but has overriden its "render" function, it always renders the listing (twisted.web.static, ~ line 1010 in Twisted 12.2).

Your subclass can override it and process the POST method accordingly, here i added a feedback message for the user:

class MyDirectoryLister(DirectoryLister):
    ## ...

    def render(self, request):
        if request.method == "POST":
            message = self.render_POST(request)
        else:
            message = ""

        ## Copied from the original method...
        request.setHeader("content-type", "text/html; charset=utf-8")
        if self.dirs is None:
            directory = os.listdir(self.path)
            directory.sort()
        else:
            directory = self.dirs

        dirs, files = self._getFilesAndDirectories(directory)

        tableContent = "".join(self._buildTableContent(dirs + files))

        header = "Directory listing for %s" % (
            cgi.escape(urllib.unquote(request.uri)),)

        ## ... until here. Now return the template with the message:
        return self.template % {"header": header, "tableContent": tableContent, "message": message}


    def render_POST(self, request):
        ## ** Process the form here, considering it's not blocking, ie not too long to write the file **
        ## Return a useful message, or error...
        return "File uploaded"


Then add a "message" field in the template, eg. in a <div>.

You'll end up soon having you own DirectoryLister, as Glyph suggested :)

Hope that helps.
Philippe

Subject: [Twisted-web] Peculiarity with putChild() using the root of the
	webserver
Message-ID: <CAF-ggVNWo7_10OHyZ20tLzapzoZ+hbXejujUkOpnRkVpiQ8zmA@mail.gmail.com>

I have been playing with Twisted 12.2.0, and encountered this minor
infelicity:

1) Files not at the root of the web server work as expected:

a) putChild("foo", File("some-directory")) works as expected - URL is
http://example.com/foo/

b) Navigating to the directory "bar" within "foo" gives a URL of
http://example.com/foo/bar/ as expected.


2) Files at the root of the web server wind up with an extra "/" in the URL:

a)  putChild("", File("some-directory")) yields a URL of
http://example.com//   <-- note double slash

b) navigating to the same directory "bar" gives: http://example.com//bar
<-- double-slash again...

Conclusion:

I think it would make sense to special the case of the root directory and
not output a double "//" in the URL.

Glad to hear it.

This is not the root of the web server.

The thing you are calling putChild *on* is the root of the web server.  You are placing a directory as the index of another directory.  This is obviously a sort of silly thing to do, but it is nevertheless possible.

> b) navigating to the same directory "bar" gives: http://example.com//bar   <-- double-slash again...

Think of this as ".getChild('').getChild('bar')" rather than "double-slash".  Or rather, .getChild(x).getChild(y) where x and y happen to be '' and 'bar' respectively; there just isn't anything special about '' other than it looking funny to humans.

> Conclusion:

I think the thing to do would be to provide some better debugging / diagnostic / visualization tools to allow people to see what sort of hierarchy they've constructed, since this is in some sense an entirely sensible thing.  I was momentarily tempted to say that we should make it an error, but then I realized that while constructing hierarchies this way is perhaps gauche according to the idioms of the web, is is in no way incorrect, and there's no reason to break people's programs for doing it.

Message-ID: <2960B912-D2F9-4BB4-B7F5-3D3D3076475A@schollnick.net>

Folks,

I am in the process of writing, a "gallery" style web server application using twisted....

The main goal is to be able to browse, and access my image library, without having to add the files to a database, etc....

The issue I am having is with the URL processing....

Standard ASCII, and non-extended characters are working fine....  And I've tried using urllib.quote & urllib.quoteplus (along with unquote), to solve this problem....  

But an URL with a dash (-) or number sign (#), or non-ASCII (eg 2012.7.1-???-  de die in diem) prevents it working...

The DASH or number sign will generally produce a 500 internal server error, non-ascii, will allow me to transverse to the directory, but the server fails to properly decode the URL, and none of the images work.....

What happens is....

Server side - 

The Server decodes the request string, and transverse to the directory structure in the URL.  For example, http://127.0.0.1:8888/albums/Television/B5/ would transverse into the albums / Television / B5 directory....  And http://127.0.0.1:8888/albums/Television/B5/ADVDEST.JPG?slideshow=1 would show the ADVDEST.JPG that is stored in the directory...

The issue I am having is that the POST request string is stopping at a single quote mark...

pre -  ['albums']
post -  ['anime', '(C54) [RPG']
RS /albums/anime/(C54) [RPG
/Volumes/DVR Storage/MMAP/gallery/sites
['albums']
POST ['anime', '(C54) [RPG']
ARGS {}

The directory name is (c54) [rpg' company (toumi haruka)] wedding bell (ah my goddess) [english][saha].

Any one have any suggestions on how to solve this?  As I mentioned URLlib.quote_plus / unquote_plus don't seem to make a difference....

The one idea I had, was to send the web server an index, but that would be a pain, since you would not be able to type in the directory, as a shortcut...  You would only be able to transverse via the web GUI....

	- Benjamin

Twisted Web should log an exception with a traceback any time it emits a 
500 error.  Have you checked the logs to see what exception is 
happening?

"#" has special meaning in a URL, and if you are typing it into a 
browser's location bar, then the browser is intentionally *not* sending 
it or anything following it.  You have to type %23 instead to represent 
a "#" that is part of the PATH of a URL.  A literal "#" signifies the 
start of the "fragment" portion of the URL.

Subject: [Twisted-web] twisted web and css files
Message-ID: <CAKmUHjYpQuoHf23dvJbo-CCBmqB=4ZfzLBKGXRmbxrN4Mw4jgQ@mail.gmail.com>

I seem to have a problem processing css files with twisted.web using
twisted templates.


I get a message in my Firefox error console saying that it could not load
the css file since the type was text/html not text/css

I am running on windows 7 32bit
python 2.7.3
twisted 12.2.0
twisted templates

The template renders fine but without the styling.

I have hunted around for some ideas as to what the problem is but most seem
to be that people have not added the static file location to root.

In theory I do not have that problem since the message says it has found
the file but will not process it since it has the wrong type.

In my template file I add the link for the css file and give it the correct
file type. But I assume I have overlooked something since it refuses to
process the css.

My template is based on one of the demo templates and I have really just
added the css link

<html xmlns:t="http://twistedmatrix.com/ns/twisted.web.template/0.1">
<head>
<title>
Add Admin User
</title>
<link href="styles/jahstyle.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
</head>
<body>
<div t:render="header" />
<ul>
<li t:render="widgets">
<t:slot name="widgetName"/>
</li>
</ul>
<div t:render="footer" />
</body>
</html>


The python that is processing this file is based on the samples I found
with some additions to add the staic file for  the css


from twisted.web.server import Site, NOT_DONE_YET
from twisted.web.resource import Resource
from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.web import server, static

from twisted.web.template import Element, renderer, XMLFile, flattenString
from twisted.python.filepath import FilePath

class WidgetsElement(Element):
    loader = XMLFile(FilePath('iteration-1.xml'))

    widgetData = ['gadget', 'contraption', 'gizmo', 'doohickey']

    @renderer
    def widgets(self, request, tag):
        for widget in self.widgetData:
            yield tag.clone().fillSlots(widgetName=widget)

    @renderer
    def header(self, request, tag):
        return tag('Header.')

    @renderer
    def footer(self, request, tag):
        return tag('Footer.')


def printResult(result):
    print result

class Root(Resource):
    isLeaf = True
    def render_GET(self, request):
        request.write("<!DOCTYPE html>\n")
        #flattenString(request, Hello()).addCallback(request.write)
        flattenString(None, WidgetsElement()).addCallback(request.write)
        request.finish()
        return NOT_DONE_YET

root = Root()
root.putChild('styles', static.File("styles"))
site = Site(root)
reactor.listenTCP(8080, site)
reactor.run()

So if anyone has some clues as to what I should look for next that would be
very welcome.

Regards

Message-ID: <CAKmUHjbqtJ5F6RT7qAs3wVDfausE+CBo7Jjs5MpRnXgebkhaTw@mail.gmail.com>

As an additional test I took the simple demo from twisted web in 60 seconds
and checked that out.

from twisted.web.server import Site
from twisted.web.static import File
from twisted.internet import reactor

resource = File('/tmp')
resource.indexNames = ['adminuser.html']
factory = Site(resource)
reactor.listenTCP(8888, factory)
reactor.run()

The adminuser.html has the same sort of link to get the css and in this
case all renders successfully.

But here the whole site is set up as static so I can see why that might
have worked.

For anyone really interested below is the css as well.

body {
  padding-left: 11em;
  color: black;
  background-color: #ff0000 }

h1 {
  color: orange;
  }

ul.navbar {
  list-style-type: none;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  position: absolute;
  top: 2em;
  left: 1em;
  width: 7em }
h1 {
  font-family: Helvetica, Geneva, Arial,
        SunSans-Regular, sans-serif }
ul.navbar li {
  background: #ececec;
  margin: 0.5em 0;
  padding: 0.3em;
  border-right: 1em solid black }
ul.navbar a {
  text-decoration: none }
a:link {
  color: maroon }
a:visited {
  color: blue }
address {
  margin-top: 1em;
  padding-top: 1em;
  border-top: thin dotted }

.layout1 {
   background-color: f2f2f2;

}

It sounds like the css is being served with a "Content-Type: text/html" 
header instead of a "Content-Type: text/css" header.  You should double 
check this using another tool (eg HEAD(1) or telnet(1)).  If this is the 
case, then you may need to add css to your site-wide mime.types file 
(sounds gross, I know, sorry) or add the necessary item to the mapping 
loaded by Twisted Web.

See `twisted.web.static.File.contentTypes`.  If it does not have an 
entry for css, or has the wrong content-type for it, that's the problem. 
Since you mention running on Windows, I think this is a likely 
explanation; it wouldn't surprise me if Windows didn't include a very 
complete mime types database (or one at all, or Twisted Web doesn't know 
how to load it).

Thanks for the info.

I have checked out contentTypes and it would appear to be present {css:
text/css).

What I have not been able to pin down is where the content type is being
set or unset or being left as html.

Chrome seems to read in the css file but still does not do what I expect.
Firefox still says it will not load the resource.

So everyone can find it but they all say it is typed as text/html.

I imagine no one else has seen this, since all the comments I see say that
once they set up the static File it all starts to work.

Looks like more ploughing through docs and code.

Thanks

John Aherne
