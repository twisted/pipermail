Subject: [Twisted-web] Twisted 16.2.0pre1 Release Announcement
Message-ID: <C8564EFB-FC4D-40F0-8FE9-D27FB28EFF6A@atleastfornow.net>

Hi everyone! Time for another Twisted prerelease!

Our release cadence stays steady, and this prerelease should bring some new nice features! The highlights include:

- twisted.protocols.haproxy.proxyEndpoint, a wrapper endpoint that gives some extra information to the wrapped protocols passed by haproxy;
- Migration of twistd and other twisted.application.app users to the new logging system (twisted.logger);
- Porting of parts of Twisted Names' server to Python 3;
- The removal of the very old MSN client code and the deprecation of the unmaintained ICQ/OSCAR client code;
- More cleanups in Conch in preparation for a Python 3 port and cleanups in HTTP code in preparation for HTTP/2 support;
- Over thirty tickets overall closed since 16.1.

For more information, check the NEWS file (link provided below).

As usual, it's available for download -- go here (https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/16.2.0pre1/) to get the prerelease tarballs and the full NEWS file.

Please let me know if you have any issues, as well as if you don't! If everything works well, that's a good thing for me to know :)

Twisted Regards,
Amber Brown (HawkOwl)

Hi everyone!

It's finally time to pull the trigger on this.

Twisted's Trac may be down intermittently in the next few hours as I do the migration.

Hi everyone!

Twisted infra is now back up and kicking, and we've moved to https://github.com/twisted/twisted as our "authoritative" mirror.

Message-ID: <8DA10464-22CE-430B-A6A7-DD02019DBAD1@atleastfornow.net>

Hi everyone,

Keeping the infrastructure updates coming! I'm going to be moving the Buildbot to new hardware, so it may be down for today, plus however long DNS takes to propagate. This should only affect Twisted committers running tests on the builder infrastructure; Trac, docs, and everything else will remain online.

Hooray!  I am already noticing faster response times from the web UI, both on buildbot and www.twistedmatrix.com :-).

Subject: [Twisted-web] Twisted 16.2 Release Announcement
Message-ID: <269D218D-946F-4C59-90E8-50165338D33D@atleastfornow.net>

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am honoured to announce the release of Twisted 16.2!

Just in time for PyCon US, this release brings a few headlining features (like the haproxy endpoint) and the continuation of the modernisation of the codebase. More Python 3, less deprecated code, what's not to like?

- twisted.protocols.haproxy.proxyEndpoint, a wrapper endpoint that gives some extra information to the wrapped protocols passed by haproxy;
- Migration of twistd and other twisted.application.app users to the new logging system (twisted.logger);
- Porting of parts of Twisted Names' server to Python 3;
- The removal of the very old MSN client code and the deprecation of the unmaintained ICQ/OSCAR client code;
- More cleanups in Conch in preparation for a Python 3 port and cleanups in HTTP code in preparation for HTTP/2 support;
- Over thirty tickets overall closed since 16.1.

For more information, check the NEWS file (link provided below).

You can find the downloads at <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted> (or alternatively <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads>). The NEWS file is also available at <https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-16.2.0/NEWS>.

Many thanks to everyone who had a part in this release - the supporters of the Twisted Software Foundation, the developers who contributed code as well as documentation, and all the people building great things with Twisted!

Twisted Regards,
Amber Brown (HawkOwl)
