I know, I know! You're comment in the stan doc shamed me into spending 
time to properly, and hopefully fully, answer the question. ;-)

I basically agree.

IRC has the distinct advantage of being quicker and more interactive. I 
find email can take a lot longer to answer because I am much more 
careful about what I write. That means I don't always pay as much 
attention to the mailing list as I should.

Actually, I'm being a bit unfair on myself. I often read an email and 
deliberately leave it unread with the intention of answering it later, 
when I have more time. Currently, I have 52 unread messages in my 
Twisted folder so it's obviously not a strategy that works well.

What we really need is a Twisted app that intergrates all the services 
that a distributed development team would ever needs. Anyone fancy 
writing it over the weekend? ;-)

Cheers, Matt
