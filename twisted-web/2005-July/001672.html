<PRE>Hi Tommi,

&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Work through current documentation, asking questions about things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> confuse me and providing the answers/clarifications as a rewrite of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current documentation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest you start with this, using the roundup issue tracking system
</I>&gt;<i> to submit documentation bugs (the mailing list archives have a good list
</I>&gt;<i> of things you should include in the report, IIRC by Mary)
</I>
I don't know about the roundup issue tracking system. I'll look into it.

Are you suggesting that I comb the archives and consolidate all reported
documentation errors? I have gone through the archives, but this feels
like a very big project. If enough folks thought it would be a worthy and
pressing contribution I suppose I could take it on. But I'd kind of like
to be learning some hands-on Twisted as I go.

What do you mean &quot;IIRC by Mary?&quot;

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Develop totally parallel documents
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel most of the efforts that have gone this way have ended up dying
</I>&gt;<i> quietly with nothing much achieved, and more to the point, with no value
</I>&gt;<i> gained by the Twisted or Nevow projects.
</I>
I can see the problem. I have started a parallel document:
<A HREF="http://twisted.paisite.com.">http://twisted.paisite.com.</A> It's a first baby step, but I'd certainly not
like to see it die on the vine. Feedback and &quot;next-step&quot;
suggestions/contributions would certainly help me keep up the momentum.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Submit my questions to the mail-list. Consolidate and re-write
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> responses. Submit suggested &quot;patches&quot; to current documention.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes please.
</I>
I can do this. I'm not sure that I'm knowledgable enough yet to suggest
rewrites. But I've got questions aplenty.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Start a new document on my site or one of the Twisted sites. Write
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I understand with questions about what I don't. Invite clarifications
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through the mail-list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That might work too, but please try to get it integrated into twisted
</I>&gt;<i> early (being a draft is no reason not to be part of the project), and
</I>&gt;<i> make sure people on the mailing lists see your open questions.
</I>
See above. If Techno's Adventures prove useful to the Twisted community,
I'd be more than honored to have them integrated into the project.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you very much for your efforts. (Thank you even more if something
</I>&gt;<i> real comes out of this ;)
</I>
And thank you for your thoughtful response. I've taken a first small step
with Techno's Adventures. And hope to add experiments as I myself learn
more over the coming days and weeks. I will indeed look into this &quot;roundup
issue tracking system&quot; you mentioned.

Best wishes,

Lloyd
