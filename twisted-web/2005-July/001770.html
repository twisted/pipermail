I think I forgot to mention that it happens while attempting to render 
livepage.glue, if that helps any

Thank you.

&gt;<i> Application

</I>
The application (by which I mean the thing I'm working on, not the application 
pseudoclass) was already designed as a collection of components.  I find it 
terribly convenient to be able to mix and match implementations as needed.  
If I was building an application based on a componentized design, why would I 
not just use the Componentized instance that every application must have 
anyway?  Do you really think it would make any difference if I had 
instantiated my own?  (I'll give it a shot this evening, but it's really just 
more voodoo...)

Mike.
