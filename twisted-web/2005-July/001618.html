<PRE>Lloyd, as a fairly experienced Nevow user who has gone through the same
frustrations, I'll gladly help to the extent what you're writing about
applies to Nevow. I understand that Twisted.web2 is more like Nevow than
Twisted.web, so that may make sense. (Actually, you may want to use
Nevow -- check it out at <A HREF="http://nevow.org/.">http://nevow.org/.</A>) 

Contact me directly if interested. Also, don't forget the #twisted.web
channel on the Freenode IRC server, which is an excellent real-time
resource that has helped me a great deal with questions.

Best regards,
Ed Suominen

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm Lloyd, I'm baffled, and I'd like to offer my modest talents to help
</I>&gt;<i> others like me come up to speed with Twisted.web in record time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been looking for a way to bring a large ColdFusion application over
</I>&gt;<i> to Python. Twisted.web looks to offer all that I could wish for and more.
</I>&gt;<i> The work to date is awe-inspiring. But... the documentation,
</I>&gt;<i> well-intentioned as it is, and much more ample than in many Open Source
</I>&gt;<i> projects, truly baffles me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm first to admit my limitations: I'm still in the early learning stages
</I>&gt;<i> of Python; I understand OO conceptually, but have little experience
</I>&gt;<i> writing or reading OO code; and, approaching the golden years, undoubtably
</I>&gt;<i> have far fewer functioning neurons than most of the subscribers to this
</I>&gt;<i> list, much less the brilliant young turks who have created the Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> framework.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But, browsing through the archives, it's clear that I am not alone in my
</I>&gt;<i> confusion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I'd like to make a proposal:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have many years of writing and editing experience. Back in the days when
</I>&gt;<i> personal computers were still connected to audio cassette recorders, and I
</I>&gt;<i> was as excited but unenlightened about PCs as I am now about Twisted, I
</I>&gt;<i> contributed three well-received articles to Personal Computing magazine
</I>&gt;<i> under the name Techo Turkey. These helped readers hook up IBM Selectric
</I>&gt;<i> Terminals to their new PCs, create a computer-controlled haunted house for
</I>&gt;<i> Halloween, and set up a computer-controlled home security system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would like now to offer to write some supplementary documentation for
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted.web aimed at turkeys like me -- the really really basic stuff plus
</I>&gt;<i> sure-to-work examples that can bring even Mickey-the-Dunce to sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> level of understanding that he can participate creatively in the Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> community.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The catch: I need knowledgeable folks willing to answer my many many
</I>&gt;<i> stupid questions like, once you've installed Twisted from, say, Debian,
</I>&gt;<i> where should what files go and how should permissions be defined?
</I>&gt;<i> Undoubtably these generous mentors would also need to critique my newbie
</I>&gt;<i> code and perhaps, even, submit examples of their own. Who know, maybe we
</I>&gt;<i> could even get a book out of it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any takers?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best wishes,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lloyd
</I>


</PRE>
