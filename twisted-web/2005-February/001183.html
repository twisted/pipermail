<PRE>Hi Matt,

Fair enough. I was just surprised.

&gt;<i> canvas.swf is a small Flash file (movie?) that supports the nevow.canvas
</I>&gt;<i> module. nevow.canvas allows the server to actively draw on the canvas in
</I>&gt;<i> the browser. canvas.swf also sends user events (mouse clicks etc) back
</I>&gt;<i> to the server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe divmod are using canvas in Quotient to render &quot;real-time&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> performance graphs, or something like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Get Nevow from svn trunk and have a look.
</I>
I will, I was able to get an idea of what twisted is from the site, but
wasn't quite sure what nevow or a couple of the other projects are. I will
take a look at whatever examples are there(and continue to lurk in order
to learn more about the projects). Certainly there seems to be a lot of
interesting-to-awesome stuff going on.

&gt;&gt;<i>What would your desires be along these lines?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you mean by this? Personally, I would like canvas to
</I>&gt;<i> keep out of the way ... until I need it. Fortunately,
</I>&gt;<i> that's exactly how it is already.
</I>
Ha Ha, yes. I just meant that I could imagine Donovan's fustration with
having to use the flash ide just to compile a file and that by knowing
more what was needed, that I could look into it. It sounds like kinetic
fusion is currently all that's needed, but I asked in case there are other
similar problems somewhere that would be nice to have solved.

Thank you for your answer. I was really just wierded out by that. But it
all makes sense now.

-Cort
