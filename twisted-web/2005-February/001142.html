Sure, I'm not against options.

That's why it can be enabled on a page-by-page basis. And I get 100%
caching of the whole http site with the pure cache in rend.Page and it
has taken me minutes to enable it and now it runs at 200req/sec instead
of 7req/sec. If I change it, I will get no benefit, the API will be more
complex, and I only risk to run slower.

All forms I have are under ssl, for the ssl part I could pratically
cache nothing with that cache and I need the more finegrined one (that I
already successfully enabled on all forms but one that is so dynamic
that I can't cache it even with the stan cache, but luckily it's the one
for the account registration, so it's sure not high traffic).

If you could give me a way to use the finegrined cache to cache a whole
xml page, then I could benchmark the difference and evaluate if perhaps
I should take the pain of using the more complex less ideal API for the
http part just to reduce the nevow complexity and to avoid changing
rend.Page. I never use loader.stan for the http part (and that's the
part I can easily benchmark since it has no guard and no ssl).

&gt;<i> but probably better placed in a subclass.
</I>
That would probably duplicate code, so I don't think it's ideal, even if
it would save you a check on self.cacheTimeout per rendering if you
don't use it.
