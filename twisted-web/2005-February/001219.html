The problem here is that you need quite a lot of non-native code to extract data from the pseudo-DOM that the XML parser returns while you need very little to make sense of an Array returned by the String.split method, which is written in C too.

So String.split() (native) + myarray[n] (non-native) is likely to be faster than XML.parseXML() (native) + myxml.childNodes[n].firstChild.attributes.etcetc (non-native)... 

An optimization rule of thumb that is more effective in Flash than in other environments is: the less code you write, the faster it is, unfortunately this often makes for poorly readable code that tends to give too much for granted.

</I>
Choosing the right format for keeping the features while not losing speed will be a cool challenge, I hope I manage to dedicate some more time to it once I get to play with Canvas a little more, for today I am just happy to know I can rely on it as it won't necessarily crash my browser, shame on the linux version of the plugin anyway, it has always been sadly behind its Win/Mac counterparts in many ways.
