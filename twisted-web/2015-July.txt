Hi everyone!

Another Twisted release cycle dawns, and I bring you the first prerelease of Twisted 15.3.

This release is characterised by cleanups and porting, with at least ten modules ported to Python 3, and the removal of Lore, Twisted's use of Hotshot, and various other smaller deprecated classes and functions. Twisted has also shed its usage of "subprojects" -- there is now only one Twisted (long may it reign).

The tarball and the newsfile summarising all the changes can be downloaded from <http://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/15.3.0pre1/>.

Enjoy, and test! If no issues are found, 15.3 will be released sometime next week.

Twisted Regards,

Amber "Hawkie" Brown

The number of 'ported to Python 3' items in this release is exciting.
Looks like I can start moving my first small legacy Twisted project over to
3.4 next month.
Looking forward to see how it goes.
