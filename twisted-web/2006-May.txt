Message-ID: <20060502214403.87600.qmail@web31508.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I just downloaded the latest web2 (0.1.0) and tried to
run the demo:

  I don't see others reporting the same problem, so I
must be doing something silly.  After looking through
cgichannel.py, it appears that I'm supposed to have a
"GATEWAY_INTERFACE" defined in my environment. 
Looking at parseVersion in http.py, it is apparent
that this env variable needs to be of the format
"something/somethingelse," but I have no idea what... 
Any help?

  (I can't seem to get demo.py to run through twistd,
either).

Thanks,

Sadly, I've had to bring the site down. Traffic jumped *insanely* and 
it was running my server into the ground :-(

I had the same problem. Reason is those sources are outdated while the 
documentation is a little newer. Download the CVS Version and compile. 
Also as a side note I tried to python setup.py all install and it didn't 
install my web2, I had to copy it over to my site-packaged. I wrote a 
little journal just deal with twisted in general. take a look:

I suspect that one of the cause is the test suite.
Is it possible to disable?

Message-ID: <7.0.1.0.1.20060508070202.01c86788@gmx.net>

Just trying out the nevow example

http://divmod.org/trac/attachment/wiki/DivmodNevow/FormHandling/Example1.1.tac.py


I would like to change the name of the submit button.
The produced html is value="Call".
I would like to have value="My own Name here".

The part of the example that renders the form is:

     def render_newsInputForm(self, ctx, data):
         return ctx.tag.clear()[
             webform.renderForms()
         ]

Can I set anything so that webform.renderForms() gives me a different 
button name?

Thanks.

Mike

Message-ID: <20060509194804.36563.qmail@web31503.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I'm having a devil of a time getting headers from the
factory returned by invoking web
client.HTTPDownloader.  Using an alternate client
(telnet) I can see that the headers are being sent and
formatted properly by the server.  But
HTTPDownloader's headers and response_headers are
empty.

I've instrumented web/client.py and can see the
headers being set in HTTPPageGetter.handleHeader(),
but these don't seem to be accessible to
HTTPDownloader... is there any way for me to get at
them?

Thanks,
Lenny G.

Message-ID: <20060512171545.90119.qmail@web31508.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

HTTPDownloader's gotHeaders() method never sets
response_headers, and, in fact, doesn't do anything
with the headers dict that it is handed, other than
extract 'content-range' for its own use.  The headers
get thrown away.

By adding a "self.response_headers = headers" line to
gotHeaders() (as HTTPClientFactory does),
HTTPDownloader can keep a copy of the headers that are
then stored in the factory object.

For now I'm just subclassing HTTPDownloader and
overriding gotHeaders so that I get the desired
behavior:

class
HTTPDownloaderWithHeaders(client.HTTPDownloader):
    def gotHeaders(self, headers):
        self.response_headers = headers
        client.HTTPDownloader.gotHeaders(self,
            headers)

Lenny,

Can you file this as a bug in the tracker, perhaps along with a unified diff for your one-line fix?  I bet that would help it get fixed faster.

I started using web2 in production about 4 months ago and it's stable
(there were bugs but I've fixed them all). Grepping for 'grep -ri nevow'
over my tree shows zero hits for about two months. The web2 API
rightfully isn't stable but people that is ok with slight change of APIs
(changes that hopefully won't require a total rewrite of the
application) should be allowed to start porting their apps to web2, and
infact in the last 4 months the API has not changed singificantly, and
it seems quite mature, much better than web1.

It is now time to make web2 mainstream, implementing any potentially
missing feature (I never tested the web2 client side for example, that
may not be mature as the server side yet) and leave for web3
any huge changes that isn't strictly necessary and that would requires a
total rewrite of the apps. Twisted-web userbase shouldn't lose more time
on the obsolete twisted.web1 api. There is people like me that needs
something with much more scalable and simpler to code with than
web1+neovw. twisted.web2 + cheetah (or other rendering templates) fills
this gap nicely. I hope that the huge nevow dependency of divmod
products generates no conflict of interest with change. Web2 always gest
installed in Twisted-HG (including all web2 fixes that are pending and
that I'll post to twisted-web list shortly).

This allows setting and getting the cookies with web2 headers. My app

This patch allows scgi logging on the scgi client side (so the main
server). Without this patch there are exceptions due the lack of
write/finish methods in the logbytecounter. It's not entirely clear if
this is the right fix but it works fine (it's not entirely clear if this
is a kind of protocol that requires no counting at all, so if the read
actually is invoked). I asked for comments several times to drier and
foom but I got no reply about this.

My suggestion to run php on top of web2 is to create an user "php" for
higher security and run this as php user (clearly port 8828/8080 should
be firewalled if you don't bind to the lo interface):

-------- cut here --------
from twisted.web2 import server, twcgi, channel, static, log

LOGPATH = 'php_logs/http.log'

class PHPScript(twcgi.PHPScript):
	filters = ('/home/php/php/bin/php',)

root = static.File('/home/php/root', processors = { '.php' : PHPScript }, indexNames=['index.php'])
#root = static.File('/home/php/root')

#root = log.LogWrapperResource(root)
#log.FileAccessLoggingObserver(LOGPATH).start()
site = server.Site(root)

from twisted.application import service, strports
application = service.Application("php")
#s = strports.service('tcp:8080', channel.HTTPFactory(site))
s = strports.service('tcp:8828:interface=127.0.0.1', channel.SCGIFactory(site))
s.setServiceParent(application)
-------- cut here --------

Then on your main twisted server add a page like this:

class page_class(resource.Resource):
	addSlash = True

	from twisted.web2 import twscgi
	child_php = twscgi.SCGIClientResource(PHP_PORT)

then page/php will run php inside directory /home/php/root.

Result is visible here:

http://webmail.cpushare.com/

Without the below that above doesn't work. This also fixes a bug in
twcgi that was passing one more dangling empty string to all cgi as last
parameter.  It's also unclear to me what the "=" check is about but it's
unrelated with the fix.

Subject: [Twisted-web] SSPI authentication (direct, or behind Apache)
Message-ID: <loom.20060519T123920-457@post.gmane.org>

I want to set up an application (MoinMoin, to be specific) running as a Twisted
web service. I'm putting it behind an Apache server (for reasons that will
hopefully become clearer below...)

I have no problem setting up the application running its own service, and no
problem setting up Apache2 as a reverse proxy, using mod_proxy.

However, I also want Apache to authenticate users for me. The reason for this is
that I want user credentials to be picked up automatically, from the user's
Windows login. (This is a corporate intranet, where single sign-on based on the
initial Windows login is the norm for all applications).

I can set up Apache to authenticate, using mod_sspi, and this works fine for
static web pages, or CGI. But my Twisted server doesn't see the username from
behind the proxy.

Does anyone know how I can set this up? I can see two potential ways of getting
this to work. One is to set up the Twisted app to authenticate via SSPI itself 
- I've got this working with a non-Twisted application which does support SSPI,
but I don't know of any equivalent of mod_sspi for twisted. The second approach
would be to get mod_proxy to somehow pass the user ID across to the target
service. However, I'm not even clear if this is possible with mod_proxy -
looking at the HTTP spec, I can't see a way of passing an "authenticated user"
successfully.

Can anyone enlighten me? If I can't get a solution like this, I may have to
resort to using FastCGI (which I've never managed to set up successfully) or
mod_python (what I'm using for the moment - but it ties down the Apache and
Python versions I can use a bit too tightly).

Thanks for any suggestions,
Paul.

I don't know.  Do you know a Windows maintainer willing to step forward to support or develop such a tool?

It probably won't be part of a Nevow release, though; it's a core Twisted sort of feature.

Maybe this link can help:
http://agiletesting.blogspot.com/2005/09/running-python-script-as-windows.html


Instead of creating an executable, a Python script can be run as a
service, using a proxy service executable.

This require the Win2K Resource Kit (the 2 binaries instsrv.exe and
srvany.exe).

Hopefully someone can rewrite these two proxy with an open source
license, and with direct support for Python.

I found this replacement for Microsoft's instsrv and srvany that IS
redistributable and includes easily modifed source code:

http://iain.cx/src/nssm/

I am using it as a general Win32 service wrapper, not just for Python
stuff...

Subject: [Twisted-web] Mysterious behavior w/ XMLRPC plus adbapi
Message-ID: <9cf621bf0605221724k2a649fb6k90fbb0609169bfd1@mail.gmail.com>

Hello from a new list member!  I'm evaluating Twisted for use in my
company's product, and I'm currently stuck on a problem that I don't know
how to debug.

I am creating an XMLRPC server that uses twisted.enterprise.adbapi to query
a database.  The symptom I've seeing is that the *third* call to an xmlrpc
method that queries the database delays for some time (a minute or so)
before returning with the correct results.  The first two calls always
return very quickly.  Calls after the third one usually return quickly as
well.

I've narrowed down the code as far as I can, and I'm not sure what to check
next.  Any help would be appreciated.  Here's what I've found so far
(complete code is at the bottom of the email):

1) Not using the XMLRPC server, just using reactor.callLater() to run the
query, then calling callLater again in the callback results in the query
getting run over and over and I never see a delay.  So I suspected the
XMLRPC server code.

2) Calling XMLRPC methods that don't use the dbpool always return quickly.
So I suspected the adbapi code.

3) Changing the cp_min argument to ConnectionPool's constructor can change
the behavior - making it larger than 3 results in the third call being
delayed, then the fourth call getting error 8002 back from the server.

4) I've tried adodbapi as well as the eval version of mxODBC just to make
sure it wasn't the db driver - the behavior is identical in both cases.

Any ideas?  Thanks in advance,
Sean

Can you tell us what platform you are on?  From your choice of db  
adapters, I'd guess you are using Windows.  What database?  MS SQL Server?

Yes, this is Python 2.4 and Twisted 2.2.0 running on WinXP Professional,
connecting to an Oracle 9i DB.  I can independently verify that ODBC
connections (from C++) succeed correctly, up to the process limit set in
Oracle, so Oracle is not running out of connections.  I haven't verified an
ADO connection yet, but I have no reason to think it won't work.

I've enlisted the help of our friendly neighborhood Oracle dba to look at it
from the database end, to see if that gives me any insights, but I'm not
sure what the best way to debug a Twisted app is - I'm still in the "getting
my brain around asynchronous programming" mode ;-)  The error code from the
Oracle driver is non-helpful, so hopefully we can extract some more info
about it today.

Thanks!
Sean

I've also tested with Python 2.3 with the same results.

(albeit it an obscure one).  I am loving Twisted, thanks to everyone
finvolved or a great package!

This is absolutely possible, the resource you're probably interested in
is twisted.web.proxy.ReverseProxyResource, which acts pretty much like
mod_proxy for Apache.

Also twisted.web/web2 and Nevow questions are best asked on the
twisted-web mailling list.

Subject: [Twisted-web] Twisted to proxy php out to apache?
Message-ID: <4473FA27.3020001@smartology.nl>

Hello fellow twisters,

David Reid suggested that I should ask the twisted.web list for answers
... so here it is.

We have a rather large web app based on xul, xmlrpc (via twisted) and
php (via apache) .... and we would like to get it all (in due time) in
python.

As a first step it would be perfect to let twisted handle php page
requests so that we can use nevow for the upcomming modules and convert
old modules when we have the time to spare.

Some time ago, I  tried to get PHP to run as a CGI from twisted ... that
was so slow that I got timing problems and a non operatable webapp.
BTW ... nothing new on the FCGI for PHP front yet?

My question ... is it possible to pass php page requests from twisted to
apache so I don't suffer the speed loss but still have my app listening
on only one port (for http and xmlrpc) ? So can twisted be a proxy for
php or is this not the recommended way to go?

I know about the reverseproxy stuff .. but if I understand that
correctly, it's about passing requests to twisted from apache or other
server. I would like it to be the other way round .. twisted passes
requests for PHP to apache, receives the processed content and passes
that back to the client. (if that method doesn't have any significant
drawbacks)

class ReverseProxyResource(resource.Resource):
    """Resource that renders the results gotten from another server

    Put this resource in the tree to cause everything below it to be relayed
    to a different server.
    """

I'm sorry, you don't understand it correctly.  mod_proxy which passes
requests from apache to another server such as twisted is a reverse
proxy, ReverseProxyResource is an implementation of a reverse proxy for
twisted so that it can forward requests to another server.  It takes a
host, a port, and a path and it proxies all requests for that resource
to the server specified by the host, port, and path.

for example, ReverseProxyResource('google.com', 80, '/') will forward
requests to http://google.com:80/.

Ok, I'm with you with that (I need to read more carefully) ... but what
I would like to do, is pass all requests for files ending with .php (and
maybe .js and .ccs) to be forwarded to another server. Forwarding
everything would make the transition from php to nevow a tad more
difficult.  Would this 'selective' proxying be possible?

Well unless you've specifically got long standing URLs to worry about
you should just take whatever static.File you had those php, js, and css
wrapped in before (when you tried CGI) and replace it with a
ReverseProxyResource to the appropriate path on the apache server.  And
then put all the nevow code in a seperate part of the hierarchy for example.

root = someBlankResource()
root.putChild('nevow', MyCoolNevowApplication())
root.putChild('oldapplication', ReverseProxyResource('localhost', 8080,
'/'))

Note that MyCoolNevowApplication can still reference javascript and CSS
being served through /oldapplication by apache via the proxy. You could
even put 'oldapplication' as a child of MyCoolNevowApplication and have
that be your root resource.  But not knowing specifically the url
hierarchy of your currently deployed application I can't give a thorough
opinion on how you should lay these things out.

If your code isnt' easily segmented in this manner then there may not be
an out of the box solution for you.

David's explanation was correct, but I tend to expect long-standing URLs to continue to work.  With that in mind: Twisted's philosophy in this regard is to provide simple interfaces so that you can write your own "glue" resources criteria as you see fit.  Since I was bored and stuck in a train station while I was reading this message, here's a quick "left/right" switch for resources.  Toooootally untested, not even run.

The way you'd use it in your program is similar to dreid's .tac example:

SegmentSwitch(lambda segments:
              segments[-1].split('.')[-1] in ('php', 'js', 'css'),
              MyCoolNevowApplication(),
              ReverseProxyResource('localhost', 8080, '/'))


And here's the implementation:

from zope.interface import implements

from twisted.web2 import resource, iweb

class SegmentSwitch(resource.Resource):
    """
    I am a resource that switches between two alternative resource hierarchies
    depending on a callable.
    """

    implements(iweb.IResource)

    def __init__(self, switch, left, right):
        """
        Create a switching resource.

        @param switch: A one-argument callable that takes a sequence of
        segments and returns False to divert to the left resource and True to
        divert to the right.

        @param left: An IResource provider to be used when 'switch' returns
        False.

        @param right: An IResource provider to be used when 'switch' returns
        True.
        """

        self.switch = switch
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    def locateChild(self, request, segments):
        if self.switch(segments):
            res = self.right
        else:
            res = self.left
        return res.locateChild(request, segments)

    def render(self, request):
        return "OOPS"

Message-ID: <2f33af970605242220l5c8ca1b5s69b5850f924b3e77@mail.gmail.com>

I need a basic HTTPS server, without any web applications support,
so I've decided to use the listenTCP and listenSSL methods, together
with a twisted.web.http.HTTPFactory, a twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel protocol
and a twisted.web.http.Request handler.

I added a ServerContextFactory for SSL (like in echoserv_ssl.py example):

class ServerContextFactory:

    def getContext(self):
        """Create an SSL context.

        Similar to twisted's echoserv_ssl example, except the private key
        and certificate are in separate files."""
        print "Creating SSL context..."
        ctx = SSL.Context(SSL.SSLv23_METHOD)
        ctx.use_privatekey_file('serverkey.pem')
        ctx.use_certificate_file('servercert.pem')
        return ctx

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from twisted.internet import reactor
    reactor.listenTCP(8000, MyHttpFactory())
    reactor.listenSSL(8043, MyHttpFactory(), ServerContextFactory())
    reactor.run()

I'm testing this configuration with ApacheBench (ab), and I get some 800
requests/sec for HTTP, and only about 30 requests/sec for HTTPS. I now that
the ratio for HTTPS is about 60% of HTTP, so I was wondering if I'm
doing something wrong, or what is causing this problem.

Thank you.

SSL encryption/decryption is a fairly expensive operation; the server is  
doing a lot more work in this case.  The numbers you are seeing aren't  
unreasonable, when you take the CPU-intensive nature of SSL into account.

Hope this helps,

Subject: [Twisted-web] Run nevow site and xmlrpc server on the same port
Message-ID: <4476C5C3.1050801@smartology.nl>

Is it possible to run a nevow site and xmlrpc server on the same port?

If so ... how

I currently have the following code:

class nevowResource(rend.Page):
   
    addSlash = True
   
    def __init__(self, service):      
        rend.Page.__init__(self)
        self.service = service

        self.putChild('RPC2', protocols.xmlrpc(self.service))

        rt = static.File("../frontend/nevow")
        rt.ignoreExt(".rpy")
        rt.processors = {'.rpy': script.ResourceScript}
        rt.indexNames.append('index.rpy')
        self.putChild('nevow', rt)
        self.putChild('php', proxy.ReverseProxyResource('localhost', 80,
'/oldcode/'))

    def locateChild(self, ctx, segments):
        """"""
        if segments[0] == '':
            # If the server is looking for the root page segments will
be ('',)
            # then renderHTTP will be called on self
            return self.renderHTTP(self), ()
        elif segments[0] in ctx.tag.children.keys():
            return ctx.tag.children[segments[0]], segments[1:]
        else:
            return None, ()
       
    def renderHTTP(self, ctx):
        """"""
        print 'render HTTP CTX:', dir(ctx)
        if self == ctx:
            return ctx.render_string()
        return ctx.tag

application = service.Application('APP', uid=1000, gid=1000)
s = myService()
serviceCollection = service.IServiceCollection(application)
internet.TCPServer(8001,
appserver.NevowSite(s)).setServiceParent(serviceCollection)

With this solution, XMLRPC seems not to be working ... and on every page
request, the xmlrpc code is imported.
My service needs to be available/accessable from both the nevow site and
the XMLPC server.

What is the best way to implement this?

Message-ID: <44770DC6.1050105@libero.it>

Hi.

The base documentation for Nevow is very well written (it is very
unfortunate that Donovan Preston no longer maintain Nevow).

Is this documentation up to date with the current versione of twisted?

What are the most important missing features?

As I can see:
- more detailed documentation of IRequest.
  As an example 200, 404 and 500 return code are automatically generated
by Nevow (when rendering a resource, when returning None by
locateChildren and bu raising an exception in a renderer, ***what else?***

- documentation of interfaces like IContainer, ISession and IRenderer,
ICanHandleException, IHand?, ...

- more detailed documentation about context (remember, ...)

- documentation for macro
- documentation for fragments
- documentation for guard

- some interfaces are not documented at all
(as ISettable, IStatusMessage, ...)


All this stuff is explained in the examples but it can help a lot to
have them organized in a better way.

You're most likely using web2 0.1 which is unfortunately very very old,
and completely out of date and should not be used at all.  I'll be doing
a web2 release 0.2 before june 9th, and you should use svn trunk[0]
until then.

If you're already using trunk it's possible that it was improperly
installed or you thought you installed it over the 0.1 release but
didn't really.  Without further information I can't really tell you what
exactly is wrong.  Good luck, and welcome.

Yes I am using web2 0.1 - I won't any more.
I did see references to later versions but I don't know about svn.
I do have Smartsvn 1.1 but I hadn't learnt how to use it yet.
However I followed my nose and used the address you gave me and it  
seems to have downloaded the stuff.
How do I install it? There is no installer
Do I just copy contents into the web2 folder at /Library/Python/2.3/ 
site-packages/twisted/web2/ after trashing previous contents?
Or maybe something else?

Subject: [Twisted-web] nevow guard and logout
Message-ID: <447D5CD3.4090207@smartology.nl>

Hello,

I've implemented the nevow guarded and logout_guard examples in my own
code, but ran into a problem.

I  start firefox and load the url http://localhost:8000/login, I get the
expected login page.
After login I can reach resources like
http://localhost:8000/login/test/test.html (before login I got a 'Sorry,
but I couldn't find the object you requested.' page)
When I return to the login page and click on logout, I get the login
page again but can still reach the test/test.html page.
After a restart of firefox, I need to log in before I get access to
/test/test.html.

Three questions:
 
- how can I prevent access to guarded resources after logout?
- is it possible to always show the login page when a guarded resource
is requested and the user is not logged in?
- is it possible to use components.registerAdapter to register the
sessionWrapper as root resource?

Thanks.

cd Twisted/ && python twisted/web2/topfiles/setup.py install

or just copy the twisted directory to
/Library/Python/2.3/site-packages/twisted

or just add the location of your checkout (for example
~/projects/Twisted/) to PYTHONPATH

export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/projects/Twisted:$PYTHONPATH

All of these things will work.

I'm actually writing some more documents
- a chapter on basic rendering (renderHTTP)
- a chapter on authentication (HTTP Basic and guard)
- a chapter on SSL setup (just stolen from PostgreSQL documentation)
- a chapter on Nevow templating for dummies (aka HTML monkeys)
- a chapter on macros and fragments


When ready I will submit a ticket.
But please note that I'm not a doc writer (nor a Nevow expert) and this
documents will contains more questions then answers.

There are a few extra gems you can find from here:
http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/TitleIndex

I am not a project contributor, but if you notice anything that could  
be better (like a page that serves as a comprehensive documentation  
index) please add it to the wiki.

Thanks.

A few comments:

- some links on http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodNevow/UsefulLinks are
broken
- http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodNevow/FuturePlans seems a bit old
- http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodNevow/Auth need more works.



However I prefer printable and complete documentation.

Problem is, without a login there (I presume that's the problem) I
can't submit a ticket.

True, but the "register" link is right there, waiting for you ;)

Seriously, I know some people hate registration etc, but currently this is  
the only way to create tickets, and tickets are the best way to ensure  
that things like documentation improvements get some attention.

Hope this helps,

It's not that; it's just that I've set up 6 trac servers recently and
never seen a "register" link on any of them, so I didn't know to look
for it. :)
