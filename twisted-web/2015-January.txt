Hi everyone!

The long awaited 15.0 release is nearly here, and the first prerelease is available for you (yes, you!) to download and try out.

Tarballs are available at https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/15.0.0pre1/ .

Highlights are:

- SSLv3 is disabled by default by endpoints created by `twisted.internet.endpoints.serverFromString` and `twisted.internet.endpoints.clientFromString`.

- inlineCallbacks now has introductory documentation, and now supports using the return statement with a value on Python 3.

- `twisted.web.client.Agent` now supports using UNIX sockets.

- A whole bunch of bug fixes and other improvements, with 70+ closed tickets.

For more details, please see the NEWS.txt file alongside the tarballs.

Try them out! :)

Ran 1116 tests in 26.381s

PASSED (skips=2, expectedFailures=1, successes=1113)

:)

(We actually deploy Twisted directly from SVN, so I don't usually test
prereleases, but it was easy enough to check)

Hi everyone!

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am honoured to announce that Twisted 15.0.0 is *here*!

Highlights are:

- SSLv3 is disabled by default by endpoints created by `twisted.internet.endpoints.serverFromString` and `twisted.internet.endpoints.clientFromString`.
- inlineCallbacks now has introductory documentation, and now supports using the return statement with a value on Python 3.
- `twisted.web.client.Agent` now supports using UNIX sockets.
- `ProcessEndpoint` now has flow control, which makes it useful for many more protocols
- A whole bunch of bug fixes and other improvements, with 70+ closed tickets.

You can find the downloads at <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted> (or alternatively <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads>). The full details of what?s new in the release is contained in the NEWS file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twisted/twisted/releases/release-15.0.0-7335/NEWS>.

As usual, many thanks to everyone who had a part in this release - the supporters of the Twisted Software Foundation, the developers who contributed code and documentation, and all the people building great things with Twisted!

Twisted Regards,
HawkOwl
