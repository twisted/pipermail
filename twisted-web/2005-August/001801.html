I think what is needed more is feeback from inexperienced users like
myself, because we are the ones that need this type of documentation. 
Your documentation and the xhtml templates tutorial by Donovan Preston
that you had a link to are just great.  But why didn't I find them on
the divmod.org site or on Nevow's home page?  There appears to
actually be quite a bit of documentation floating around, but you have
to dig and dig to find it!

The examples in the distribution are very good.  But not linked to
from divmod.org or nevow.og.  Your tutorial isn't linked to from
either of these sites either.  The wiki doesn't have links to these I
could find, nor links to the examples included in the distribution. 
It seems it would take very little effort to just update the wiki with
links to some of this stuff, and make some quick changes to divmod.org
and nevow.org to at least point to the wiki.  Ok well the divmod.org
Nevow page does have a link to the wiki, but it's in small text as the
very last line on the page!!

Writing new documenation is a lot of work, and the stuff that Kieran
and Donovan wrote is very good, not too mention the examples in the
distribution which look like they took a considerable amount of effort
to put together.  It's a shame they are so difficult to find.
