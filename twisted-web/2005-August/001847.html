</I>
I'm afraid you've misunderstood me, or I was unclear (though you then 
seem to answer me at the bottom, so maybe not):

I'm asking about Twisted-based (native asynchronous) HTTP application 
servers that provide higher levels of abstraction than http.Request and 
rend.Page - specifically high-level services such as per-HTTP-request 
transaction managers, TTW object editing and the other examples I listed 
(and more maybe). Zope is the closest comparison. Zope is a higher-layer 
server written on top of (heavily retooled) medusa, a threadpool, ZODB 
and DTML/ZPT/PythonScripts. This unspecified app server would be written 
on top of Twisted, twisted.web, nevow (and other stuff).

I had assumed that was about as on-topic as you could get for 
&quot;twisted-web&quot; list, but maybe not.

re: LDAP, filestores, and so forth, I was using those as examples of the 
kind of high-level services such an app framework may provide, rather 
then specific features I need.

&gt;<i> pgasync is pretty good for writing Twisted apps which use PostgreSQL backend. 
</I>
I'm using it. It has some issues, but none that are insurmountable. It's 
certainly very good, but a DBAPI2 (or rather, ADBAPI) connector hardly 
counts as a high-level component.

&gt;<i> It has some glitches, none of which are really real (not working mailing 
</I>&gt;<i> list, NOTIFY/LISTEN unsupported ATM, some trouble with good reaction for 
</I>&gt;<i> server shutdown message).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> About LDAP and filestore... well, you just need a transaction-aware library, 
</I>&gt;<i> that does what you need. 
</I>
...erm, and a transaction manager integrated to the HTTP request 
handler, which is an application server feature...

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tracking code changes? Well, that's what subversion is good for. Perhaps it 
</I>
We'll have to agree to disagree there I'm afraid. Subversion appears to 
be &quot;good for&quot; getting Berkeley database errors and being a lot slower 
than CVS, all so we can &quot;mv&quot; files and run over HTTP? Big woop...

(That was a joke)

&gt;<i> won't be as convinient as what you have integrated into ZOPE, but there are 
</I>&gt;<i> GUI frontends available.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Of course writing all these would be relatively trivial, but the time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>spent piles up. I'm aware the divmod suite has an app server (Mantissa)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>but to be frank I don't like Atop. I'm quite happy (actually I prefer)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>filesystem-backed code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, as far as I know, atop is passe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Check out Glyph's journal at 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.livejournal.com/users/glyf/39104.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/glyf/39104.html</A> . I think both he and the 
</I>&gt;<i> whole Divmod crew is coming up with some exciting stuff, as usual. 
</I>
SQLite eh? Interesting.



&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that Axiom and new Mantissa is what you want. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>So what's the state of play for layers between t.web -&gt; (appserver) -&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>appcode. I would expect the obvious choice for components within the app
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>server to be t.e.adbapi, nevow, t.cred and then onto the more narrow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>components like a caching framework, indexing, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's leave Nevow doing web stuff. That's the way things should be done.
</I>
I did not intend to suggest otherwise. I think you have misunderstood 
portions of my email, or read stuff into it that I did not mean to 
imply; or I have been unclear.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For high-level webapplication stuff, consult Divmod's development lists, check 
</I>&gt;<i> out Axiom and Mantissa, share your ideas with the team. I think, that this is 
</I>&gt;<i> the Nevow-based thing you need.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Take care,
</I>
I'll take a look at that.

I'm surprised there isn't something a little more lightweight though. 
Quite what it would look like I don't know, which is why I'm asking.
