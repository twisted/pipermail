Yes. Supporting Deferred attribute values needs to happen.

This is not a bug. However, it arises because of the really, really bad 
semantics of __implements__. Basically, you subclassed Renderer and 
didn't declare that your subclass implemented the interfaces which 
Renderer declares it implements. This didn't matter before, so you 
didn't notice that there was a problem. Now it matters, and boom.

When declaring that a subclass implements some interfaces, don't forget 
to declare that it implements the super interfaces, too:

class Foo(Renderer):
	__implements__ = IBar, Renderer.__implements__

Someone, can we please please switch to the better semantics for 
declaring implementation used by either z3 now or PyProtocols?
