Yeah, don't worry - the wiki is maintained. I remove spam most days
(although I'm not so diligent at weekends) and I know there are others
who also remove spam as they find it. Unfortunately, the last time I
cleaned up was probably the day it got spammed again :-/.

I track changes using RSS but, for some reason, that doesn't pick up
*all* changes so I also do a full search for '<A HREF="http://'">http://'</A> and scan down the
results. The spammed pages are fairly obvious that way.

Anyway, thanks for the warning and for clearing up the front page.

Cheers, Matt
