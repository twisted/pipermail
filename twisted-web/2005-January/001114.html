I definitely agree with you, there's no point in duplicating this code
except to risk having more bugs and risk not merging optimizations from
the other duplicate forks. Let's not fall in love with compy if that
means duplicating efforts.

&gt;<i> As far as I'm concerned, the appropriate course of action is to convert

</I>
Yep. And if it's still *that* slow, then we should rewrite
*zope.interfaces* (not compy) with pyrex. what's the point of writing
compy with pyrex and leaving zope.interfaces dogslow? We should do that
once for all if we do it.

Leaving compy as a pure &quot;API-forwarder&quot;, so old code doesn't break may
even be ok of course, but it should not try to duplicate anything that
is already available in zope.interfaces.

But still I'm sceptical about the computational complexity of the compy
stuff, so I believe that should be evaluated before going in C.

&gt;<i> &gt;Writing a compy2 speedup in Pyrex will help and will probably also be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;faster than zope.interface since it will be a lot smaller.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now not only are we keeping the old code, but heavily rewriting it? I 
</I>&gt;<i> have my doubts about those speed benefits, too...
</I>
Agreed.
