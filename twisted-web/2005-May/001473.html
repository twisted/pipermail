Hi

dialtone requested a more verbose example on IRC, so here it is.

My basic idea is that having a common application structure would  
allow for reuseable components (I mean &quot;embeddable applications&quot;)  
like forums, weblogs, younameit.

When developing in such a &quot;best practice&quot; you would create self- 
contained packages for each &quot;logically seperated&quot; part like such  
applications as stated above. The applications would be reuseable,  
then, and one could imagine that there could be a central repository  
of such applications.

IMO there would also be a need for a central authentication and  
permission handling package so a forum application can access the  
same data as a CMS application. All this looks a bit like the concept  
&quot;Zope&quot; and &quot;Zope Products&quot; have. I don't really like Zope because of  
its ZODB integration into everything, the templating system etc. but  
I think it is very successful because you have myriads of components  
you can base your web sites on.

If there was a &quot;common auth infrastructure&quot; and a definition of how  
components have to look for the outside and how you can embed them  
into your code, I think Nevow would become much more effective to  
work with since code becomes reuseable.

Maybe these are ideas are not new to the Nevow project and its  
community and they had their reasons not to create such structures,  
but I just wanted to raise the issue to see what happens ;)

PS: Here is an example of the code layout:

# The project root contains the tac file to run the server and the &quot;site
# specific&quot; modules.
$PROJECT/
   server.tac

   [projectname]/
     __init__.py

     # This package contains files that are &quot;glue&quot; for the other  
modules like
     # the &quot;main layout&quot; template containing &lt;html&gt;...&lt;/html&gt;.
     site/
       # This module defines rend.Page chidren like a RootPage etc.
       __init__.py
       # another module with site specific things
       somemodule.py
       html/
         sometemplate.html
         sometemplate.html
       sql/ (if desired)
         mysql.sql
         othersql.sql
       resources/
         style1.css
         style2.css
         image1.png
         image2.jpg
         moo.js

     # These are other self-contained, but site specific modules.  
This could
     # be a custom user management, a forum etc. with all the  
necessary Python
     # code, CSS, JS, images etc.
     sitespecific1/
       __init__.py
       datahandler.py
       something.py
       html/
         ...
       sql/
         ...
       resources/

       __init__.py
       html/
         ...
       sql/
         ...
       resources/
         ...

# The &quot;module repository&quot; contains reuseable, &quot;embeddable&quot;  
applications. These
# could be a user management system that brings login forms etc, a  
forum etc.
$COMPONENTS
   # The packages here have the same structure as the packages above  
in the
   # project's directory.
