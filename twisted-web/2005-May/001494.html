<PRE>&gt;<i> Are you sure reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop) is being called?
</I>
Yes and no - I was sure it was being called (a print statement before) BUT
it turns out it was actually calling and returning ok.

But I found the problem! I needed this at the start:

from twisted.python import threadable
threadable.init( with_threads=1)

DOH!

&gt;<i> And make sure you aren't accidentally doing
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop())&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> which is a common mistake!
</I>
When I first read this I thought &quot;damn thats what I've done&quot; but I wasn't.

&gt;&gt;<i> Is there an advised pattern for working with the reactor with multiple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> threads?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes: use callFromThread everytime you need to call a Twisted function
</I>from a thread :)

;)

The following is more what I meant by a discussion of patterns. (These are
NOT real.. just designed to illustrate for discussion):

  The wxwidgets pattern: simple case is to use the wxreactor.
  However, you COULD run the GUI normally and run the reactor in a
non-main thread. Be sure to communicate with the reactor using
callFromThread or having a protocol reading a Queue.Queue() object.

  The readline pattern: you have a shell-like interface and need to call
the blocking function raw_input(). (Sure, you can use the stdin protocol
in normal twisted but that won't play with readline).

  You run the reactor in a non-main thread and communicate with it as above.


And the pattern could come with a simple proof-of-concept program, like
this one...

I also have a readline example working now. I can post it to the list if
anyone is interested.

#!/bin/env python

&quot;&quot;&quot;Trivial demo - demonstrate the reactor in a NON main thread.

You can telnet to port 7001 and see echos of everything you type for
10 seconds. After that it should close cleanly. But it doesn't - yet.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

import sys
import time
import threading
from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.protocols import wire
from twisted.internet.protocol import Factory
from twisted.python import threadable

threadable.init( with_threads=1)

class ReactorFacade:

	def __init__( self ):
		self.reactorThread = threading.Thread(
			target=reactor.run,
			name=&quot;ReactorThread&quot;,
			kwargs={'installSignalHandlers':0},
			)

	def start(self):
		# assume not yet started
		print &quot;Facade: starting...&quot;
		self.reactorThread.start()
		print &quot;Facade: started ok&quot;

	def stop(self):
		# assume already running
		print &quot;Facade: request stop&quot;
		reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop)
		print &quot;Facade: request stopped ok&quot;
		self.reactorThread.join()

factory = Factory()
factory.protocol = wire.Echo
reactor.listenTCP( 7001, factory ) # &lt;-- you don't NEED a protocol, but
for example...
print &quot;Echo on 7001&quot;
facade = ReactorFacade()
print &quot;Main: Starting...&quot;
facade.start()
print &quot;Main: Sleeping...&quot;
time.sleep(10)
print &quot;Main: Stopping...&quot;
facade.stop()
print &quot;Main: Finished&quot; # &lt;-- will hang here
