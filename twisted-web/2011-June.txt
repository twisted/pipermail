The Divmod server experienced a hardware failure.  As there is no longer a dedicated company maintaining this code, efforts to recover that data are ongoing, but sporadic.  The website (wiki) in particular, is gone for the forseeable future, and links to it need to be updated.

However, all of the code (including all in-progress branches) was successfully recovered and migrated from Subversion to Bazaar, and is now available at <https://launchpad.net/divmod.org/>.

The projects are still alive and have several interested maintainers.

Also, the WebDevelopmentWithTwisted page needs updating to mention twisted.web.template.

Subject: [Twisted-web] Class methods as callbacks/errbacks
Message-ID: <748915.65638.qm@web114501.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>

I use a wrapper functions as follows to specify the callback argument of addCallback() and addErrback().

def reqConnLostCallbk(result, arg_self):
??? arg_self.lost_conn()

def reqConnLostErrbk(failure, arg_self):
??? arg_self.lost_conn()


... inside a class method
??? d.addCallback(reqConnLostCallbk, self)
??? d.addErrback(reqConnLostErrbk, self)

??? def lost_conn(self):
??????? // cleanup
??????? pass

Is there an alternative and/or cleaner solution to specify a class method as a callback or errback?

Just pass the instance method directly to addCallback:

d.addCallback(someclass.lost_conn)

You can either specify a bound class method or an unbound.
I guess you'd like to have a bound callback, but I don't know your
entire example.


d.addCallback(some_object.lost_conn)

obj_callback = some_object.method_name # bound method

class_callback = some_class.method_name # unbound method


so the usage would be
obj_callback(args)

or

class_callback(object, args)

Thank you for the responses.? Specifying the bound instance method as the callback works.? (I remember it did not work for me many months ago, hence my post).? Works now.

will any of that help?

I would suggest moving away from athena-widget for running your app.
That way you can define your own resource structure, including serving
up the static CSS files you want to include from <head>.

You could probably use this as well. The system works pretty much the
same as the way the JS modules system works; you need to set a
cssModule (class) attribute on your widget, and define your CSS
"packages" in more or less the same way you have your JS "packages"
laid out. I haven't used this system at all, and probably wouldn't
recommend it for general use; it encourages having your CSS broken up
into lots of small per-widget fragments, but for a consistent look and
feel to your application, you really want to be doing styling at the
"global" level. (Others may have a different opinion on the subject)

Subject: [Twisted-web] Need help with resource served after authentication
	succeded.
Message-ID: <BANLkTin10=S4kSkWDwh7nrqiEZ9XY3Qk8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

I've used http://jcalderone.livejournal.com/53074.html article to get http
auth to work.
In my server.tac file I have the following

...
r = ResourceScriptWrapper('auth.rpy')
err = resource.ForbiddenResource()
r.putChild("service", err)
upd = UpdateXMLProcessor()
err.putChild("update2", upd)

httpSite = server.Site(r)
httpsSite = server.Site(r)
...

auth.rpy is an exact copy of HTTPAuthSessionWrapper resource from
forementioned article with two edits:

...
from manage import UpdateManager
...
if IResource in interfaces:
            resc = UpdateManager()
            resc.realm = self
            return (IResource, resc, lambda: None)

and manage.py is

from twisted.web import resource

class UpdateManager(resource.Resource):
    def render_GET(self, request):
        return "<html>Hello, world!</html>"

The authorization goes ok when I go to the server root. But when it is
succeeded all I get instead of Hello, world! is
No Such Resource

No such child resource.

with 404 error.

Please tell me what might I be doing wrong.

One more question:

when using twisted.cred.checkers.FilePasswordDB how can one add encrypted
password entries to this file using windows

I'm now using plain-text password in httpd.password file for auth to go ok.


Thank you,

Viatcheslav Gachkaylo

Subject: [Twisted-web] Perspective Broker: Max connections?
Message-ID: <BANLkTikE=mhxWWv9jMOX77-kC1+fvni_WQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings *,

I have been using perspective broker for a while, and now I am
encountering a scalability issue.

I have set up a single pb server; I intend to create a big workload of
client connections to this server. My server so far is possible to
accept up to ~55 connections. If I try to push more connections in
(e.g. 100), I get the following failure:

Unhandled error in Deferred:
Traceback (most recent call last):
Failure: twisted.internet.error.ConnectBindError: Couldn't bind: 24:
Too many open files.

When one of these 55 clients logs out of my server, another one of the
rest connects. It seems like there is some connection queue and the
rest are waiting there until some of the first 55 clients exits... Is
this possible? What could cause this error?

Thank you all for your attention!

Hello Ilias,

Maybe you are hitting your OS's file descriptor limit ? On Debian it is 
set quite low by default. Here's a bash script excerpt that increases it :

         grep "fs.file-max =" /etc/sysctl.conf > /dev/null 2>&1
         [ "$?" == 0 ] && sed -i "/fs.file-max =.*/d" /etc/sysctl.conf
         echo "fs.file-max = 65535" >> /etc/sysctl.conf

         grep "soft nofile " /etc/security/limits.conf > /dev/null 2>&1
         [ "$?" == 0 ] && sed -i "/soft nofile .*/d" 
/etc/security/limits.conf
         echo "soft nofile 65535" >> /etc/security/limits.conf

         grep "hard nofile " /etc/security/limits.conf > /dev/null 2>&1
         [ "$?" == 0 ] && sed -i "/hard nofile .*/d" 
/etc/security/limits.conf
         echo "hard nofile 65535" >> /etc/security/limits.conf

Proceed at your own risk :)

Subject: [Twisted-web] Debugging truncated response..
Message-ID: <98982.65356.qm@web114504.mail.gq1.yahoo.com>


I am trying to debug a scenario wherein a program has an http channel socket that receives an HTTP response; and in some cases (5 out of 10,000) the channel/transport invokes the lost connection callback while the amount of data received is less than the content length.? The connection is used as a producer to write to another connection.

I am trying to debug to check whether:
(1) the last chunk (20K+) of data sitting in the incoming response is not being propagated up, e.g. due to a prior pauseProducing() call, or 

(2) the data was not sent from the peer (e.g. connection closed without using so_linger)

In general, I "presume" lost connection callback on a producer socket would not be called if there is pending (paused) data that has yet to be written a consumer (socket).? I am also assuming that the assert in internet/abstract.py::resumeProducing() [self.connected and not self.disconnecting] is valid.? I.E: It would be great someone can confirm that scenario (1) above is not possible in twisted (unless a bug).

By the time the lost connection callback is called, the transport channel is gone.? I would have to instrument either tcp.py, basic.py, or abstract.py to track this.

If the bug is indeed scenario (2), then I will use wireshark (cause the client program has actually written the entire response to its end of the connection).

Any clues/suggestions welcome.

Thanks.

Update: I added a routine dataReceivedBufLen() to the LineReceiver class and call it to check if there is any pending data when the lost connection callback is called on the connection.? There is no pending buffered data when the connection is lost.? This implies I am using twisted properly, and maybe the bug is in the program on the other end of the connection.

Subject: [Twisted-web] Agent and timeouts
Message-ID: <BANLkTinasqVkd4n_DSPYsf+3TggdTp3P2A@mail.gmail.com>

I am using twisted.web.client.Agent to post sms messages

Occasionally I hit a problem where I do not get a response back.

I have looked around and seen various comments about timeouts with Agent.

One message had a comment that they had added an option to Agent to pass a
timeout parameter to the connect method.

But it would seem this only applies to getting connected. Once connected the
timeout is cleared.

I assume I would need to set up up some sort of callLater to fire in say 30
seconds and if the deferred has not fired, fire it with the timeout.

I assume I would also need to somehow drop the connection that is hung.

Now I am not too sure how I would do this with Agent and the request or
response.

I imagine many people will have already solved this problem but have not
seen any info on how they went about this.

If someone could give me a few pointers as to what I should look at I would
appreciate it very much.

Regards

Sorry for the double post. But after 6 hours it had not turned up so I sent
it again

Looking into more detail, it seems to me that Agent does not support
timeouts on the request.

The policies.TimeoutMixin seems only to apply to http.py and to the
web.client not used by Agent.

Am I right in that assumption.

Thanks for any info.

Thanks very much for the links. That looks like what I was looking for.

I assume it has not made its way into release yet.

Does anyone know if someone else is using the cancellation on the request or
not.

Or is it not ready for prime time

Thanks very much
