<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> The information about the user does not belong in any Resource subclass: a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Resource is a page that can be generated for different users, so it should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only contain information that is the same for all users. Any user specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data should be fetched via the request object.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is totally inaccurate. It's perfectly reasonable to store
</I>&gt;<i> user-specific data in Resource objects.  &quot;a Resource is a page that
</I>&gt;<i> can be generated for different users&quot; is either irrelevant or not
</I>&gt;<i> true, I can't tell which. You can dynamically and return Resources
</I>&gt;<i> based on which user is making the request.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, I'm not sure my favorite abstraction for a user is a string; I'd
</I>&gt;<i> probably pass something other than a username to a Resource. Perhaps a
</I>&gt;<i> rich object representing the user.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Since this is a common mis-conception (one I suffered from and have now 
disabused myself of) it's worth discussing.

If my understanding is correct: twisted.cred uses the concept of an 
&quot;avatar&quot;. Avatars (I think...):

  * are protocol objects
  * represent the user

In twisted.web, the Resource *is* the avatar. In twisted.mail.imap, the 
Mailbox is the avatar. In twisted.conch, the Shell is the avatar (and so 
on).

I found this initially confusing, because in many web frameworks e.g. 
Zope, where I came from, the objects representing resources are:

  * long lived
  * the same instances serve &gt;1 HTTP request
  * instantiated at process start time

It's also somewhat confusing because unlike other protocols, HTTP 
requests are very short-lived. It's worth noting you *can* have 
long-lived multi-instance t.w.Resource objects.

In twisted, a common design pattern seems to be (I hope; I adopted it...)

  * have your realm return a root Resource i.e. one for &quot;/&quot;
  * attach your User object to that resource
  * have your root resource dynamically create the leaf resources via 
locateChild or childFactory, then attach the User object
  * when you need user info, get at it via e.g. self.user
  * let the leaf/root objects get GC-ed when the HTTP request is done

I believe changes have been committed to twisted.web making this design 
pattern even more preferred:

<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/changeset/23950">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/changeset/23950</A>

Code which, by the way, I very much like the look of.

Could someone clarify if this is the &quot;right&quot; way of doing things?
