I can think of several reasons one might want MochiKit.

Due to the security model protecting XMLHTTP requests, you can only make 
requests back to the same origin server. Therefore, if you want to call 
an external (non-Twisted, non-Nevow, non-Athena) application from your 
Athena page, you might choose to glue that application into your server 
URL space using server-side reverse proxying.

If Athena is to replace MochiKit, it would need to provide at least as 
good primitives for e.g. JSON-RPC. If it does not, you'd still need a 
library to do so.

In *addition*, my understanding was that many (most?) browsers limited 
the number of outstanding HTTP requests you may have to a given server 
to 2. Therefore, running &gt;2 &quot;event loops&quot; for XMLHTTP requests to e.g. 
different application spaces is impossible. If you happen to have 3 
application spaces deployed into your URL hierarchy, well, tough.

It is an unfortunate choice for some of us.

Finally, I think it's worth pointing out that one might want to use the 
Nevow+Athena code for widgetry and so forth, but if one already had an 
application API as e.g. JSON-RPC calls, exposing those calls *again* to 
an &quot;implementation is internal detail&quot; Athena channel is at best time 
consuming boilerplate, and at worst bug-riddled and insecure.

Athena-JS is more like a domain-specific language IHMO. It's not 
unreasonable to want to code the non-athena specific bits to a more 
general JS platform/framework/library.

My 2pence

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Increasing the usage of MochiKit in Athena would not solve the browser
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility problem either: the lack of support for various browsers
</I>&gt;<i> stems from functionality that is not implemented in MochiKit at all.
</I>
It seems a peculiar choice to not just fold those fixes back into 
MochiKit. The upstream developer(s) have good reputations for being 
sensible people, do they not?
