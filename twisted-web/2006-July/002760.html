</I>maybe it'd be a good idea to have write some templates for tutorials
and/or DTDs/Stylesheets (that if xml will be used) that way we could also
easily generate pdfs,.. i could probably help with that and maybe even a
bit with writing documentation though I haven't used nevow much (some
years ago I've written a complete working [and deployed] webshop using
woven - nevow's predecessor for those who don't know what it is ;) and it
worked great - definitely better than mvc (which was even before woven
hehe)

I really hope this will result in some good tutorials / examples (some of
the woven examples are quite good at the moment as they are (I like the
blog / wiki tutorials though I can't get them to work with current svn
*and* the code generated by axiomatic is quite different ..)

Regards
