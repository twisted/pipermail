<PRE>Hi Lloyd,

&gt;<i> And Manlio Perillo and L. Daniel Burr have suggested that this series

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
CRUD is just an acronym for Create, Read, Update, Delete, and so-called
&quot;CRUD apps&quot; have become a popular litmus test for how handy/useful a
web application framework is.  The typical CRUD application is used as
an example of how to use a framework to talk to an RDBMS, render data
as HTML, edit data, delete it, etc.  This sort of tutorial is popular
because a large number of web applications boil down to providing a
web UI for editing some data that lives in a database, hence my suggestion.

&gt;<i> -- I'd like to keep the adventures as generic as possible across many
</I>&gt;<i> potential applications; I fear that focusing on one application may limit
</I>&gt;<i> our scope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
See above.  CRUD is pretty generic.

&gt;<i> -- Different folks may have widely different levels of interest in
</I>&gt;<i> different applications, whereas we all need to master the basics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- Developing a production-ready application may get us into a bunch of
</I>&gt;<i> nitty-gritty stuff that doesn't have much to do with Twisted, but does
</I>&gt;<i> have a lot to do with good programming practice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My suspicion is that the people looking for tutorials and quick-start type
of documentation are, in fact, trying to build a production application in
a big hurry, and want to find something to build on.  With that in mind, I
think that working up to a simple, but production-ready application would
meet with a great deal of approval.

&gt;<i> That said, maybe after we've covered the basics, using the example of a
</I>&gt;<i> good application to put it all together may be an excellent idea. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think we're talking either/or here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> PS Here's the last code example from Techno Turkey's Adventures:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Matt Goodall's Barebones Dynamic Web Server
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> from twisted.application import internet, service
</I>&gt;<i> from twisted.web import resource, server
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> LOGPATH = './logs/access.log'
</I>&gt;<i> PORT = 8080
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> class DynamicResource(resource.Resource):
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;&quot;&quot;A simple, dynamic resource with a name.
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     def __init__(self, name):
</I>&gt;<i>         resource.Resource.__init__(self)
</I>&gt;<i>         self.name = name
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     def getChild(self, name, request):
</I>&gt;<i>         # if the child's name is '' - the empty segment - then return
</I>&gt;<i>         # myself.
</I>&gt;<i>         if name == '':
</I>&gt;<i>             return self
</I>&gt;<i>         # Return an instance of my type with the requested segment name.
</I>&gt;<i>         return DynamicResource(name)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     def render(self, request):
</I>&gt;<i>         return '&lt;html&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a Dynamic Resource. My name is
</I>&gt;<i> %r.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;' % (self.name)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> application = service.Application('web-server')
</I>&gt;<i> site = server.Site(DynamicResource('root'), logPath=LOGPATH)
</I>&gt;<i> internet.TCPServer(PORT, site).setServiceParent(application)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The only thing I don't like about this example is that DynamicResource
is returning an instance of itself for requests to childrend of itself.

Granted, this is perfectly legitimate, but I think it introduces some
potential confusion for a new reader.  I would suggest just creating
a &quot;ChildResource&quot; (the nevow examples directory does this), and
perhaps returning that instead, to make it more clear what is being
done in getChild.

Thanks for everyone's efforts and feedback on this, I think we are
headed in the right direction now, and perhaps we will attain the
critical mass of contributions needed to make this documentation effort
a success.
