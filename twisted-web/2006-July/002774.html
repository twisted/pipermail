Yes!

Same here.

Ages ago, at about the age of 21 when I was less smart but harder 
working and NIH seemed like a reason, I wrote a parallel SNMP poller. I 
copied the mainloop straight out of fping and ported it to python.

It was trivially obvious even in my naivety that no thread-based 
approach was going to serve ~3000 simultaneous &quot;threads&quot;. I looked at 
Stackless, but it (foolishly IMHO) was derided by the BDFL. I didn't 
know about Twisted or asyncore (shudder - though when I did finally see 
it I retched on my keyboard). But I immediately understood the problem 
and the correct solution.

Twisted was something I found later on to do away with my custom loop 
code and concentrate on application code. Now I can tack a web interface 
onto the poller. Oh, and an SSH CLI. Oh, and an SNMP *proxy*.

</I>
If Python were Erlang (i.e. had stackless), Twisted would not exist. But 
it's not, so it does.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think I understand the problem.  The problem is that concurrency is hard.

</I>
Yep. Simple problems have simple solutions. Complex problems - anyone 
even contemplating solving them has a good chance of knowing why the 
simple solutions have failed.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not about how smart you are, it's about whether you have the relevant

</I>
Yes, yes, yes!

&gt;<i> anyone who actually has the experience necessary to tackle an application with

</I>&gt;<i> doesn't.  I don't know that that's Twisted's fault.
</I>
It certainly is not.

The previous two mails encapsulate to my mind the core of the issue. 
Anyone who needs Twisted, knows it. Anyone who doesn't cannot be 
persuaded otherwise. They will either discover it, or never need it (and 
more power to them - but that's not me).

Though it rankles, maybe advertising Twisted as a &quot;specialist&quot; framework 
would make more sense?
