<PRE>Hi Lloyd,

Fair enough, I think the Wikipedia definition is pretty good.

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_(Web">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_(Web</A>)

&gt;<i> &quot;Resource&quot; is one of the concepts that baffled me last year. I couldn't

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Representational State Transfer (REST) is the concept that I most often
use when considering resources in a web application.

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer#Resources">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer#Resources</A>

&gt;<i> Since naive folks like me are accustomed to thinking in terms of &quot;pages,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> it would probably be good to sharpen up and present your argument that
</I>&gt;<i> many web apps today have more complex structures than &quot;set of linked
</I>&gt;<i> pages.&quot; We could explicitly point out that  abstracting the notion of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;page&quot; to &quot;Resource,&quot; opens the mind to more creative possiblies, then
</I>&gt;<i> present a few examples of these possibilties. We should definitely  
</I>&gt;<i> include
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;page&quot; as an an example of a &quot;Resource,&quot; along with a few other examples.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed.

I didn't really &quot;get it&quot; at first, because I had always though in terms
of &quot;web pages&quot;.  Once I read Fielding's paper and started thinking about
logical resources, rather than &quot;every URL is a web page&quot;, everything just
fell into place, and I have a much easier time designing web applications
these days, even if I don't make them strictly in a REST-style.

&gt;<i> Want to try your hand at a crisp, evocative definition with examples?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hopefully, we can just provide links to the two resources I cited, above.
That's sort of recursive, in a way, but there you have it.

&gt;<i> Many thanks,
</I>
Not at all, thanks to you and the others on the list who got the ball
rolling again.

L. Daniel Burr
