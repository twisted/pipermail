I've also found Terry's email quite interesting. I started learning to
use Nevow lately --even not mastering it in depth I find it amazingly
elegant-- and I noticed about some of the problems described. I'm happy
because such a controversial email seems being taken seroiously instead
of provoking a flame.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Hidden (or not so hidden) here is one of Twisted's biggest problems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;right now.  Twisted's developer base is incredibly small,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;particularly when considering the scope it encompasses.  Over half
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;of Twisted was developed by just four people.  With twisted.pb and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;twisted.web2 one might think that the load has been spread out a bit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;more, but other factors have combined to result in the opposite:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;over the last year almost 3/5ths of Twisted code has been written by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;only three people.  That's a huge amount of effort by an amazingly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;small team.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is another unfortunate truth hidden (or not so hidden) here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fundamentally, while we'd also like this situation to change, someone
</I>&gt;<i> will have to take responsibility for it.  As JP mentions here, the
</I>&gt;<i> current maintainers are all overstretched in a number of different
</I>&gt;<i> directions.  While all open source projects could use more
</I>&gt;<i> contributions, by my estimation Twisted is something like 10x as
</I>&gt;<i> overstretched as any other project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While certain things you've suggested seem like useful stopgaps -- I
</I>&gt;<i> particularly like the idea of mentioning repeatedly in the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation that users should consult the source for the most
</I>&gt;<i> up-to-date information [...]
</I>
At first I tried searching for documentation, but I had to step through
the code some times. Telling users not to be afraid of reading the code
would avoid people wasting their time surfing the net.

&gt;<i> [...] the real solution to this problem _requires_ a dedicated
</I>&gt;<i> documentation maintainer for each project. That means not just a few
</I>&gt;<i> hours here and there to fix bugs, but a consistent commitment from
</I>&gt;<i> someone [...]
</I>
I also agree with you here. Based on my own experience, one person
may take care of the code _and_ the documentation when a project is
small, but when things start growing he/she will find frustating being
the only one taking care of documentation and will focus on code
instead.

&gt;<i> Terry, perhaps you would like to volunteer to be Nevow's
</I>&gt;<i> documentation maintainer; or perhaps you know someone you could
</I>&gt;<i> encourage to fill that role.  Without such a person though, I doubt
</I>&gt;<i> that we are realistically going to have enough bandwidth with our
</I>&gt;<i> existing team to even apply your simple suggestions.
</I>
I would like to help, but I don't feel like I could manage being the
main maintainer and I also like coding more than writing documentation.
Even so, if someone decides to takes care of the task, I could find
some spare time to contribute.

I know I am a newcomer here, but those are my two cents.

Cheers,
