Indeed it has but not enough probably.

This is a matter of documenting examples... a problem pretty common with all
the twisted-related frameworks I know.

&gt;<i>I'm not sure I would call this a defect. We want developers to write the

</I>&gt;<i>can't do it, then he/she would be wise to recruit/enlist competent
</I>&gt;<i>documentation writers and spend the time necessary to help them understand
</I>&gt;<i>what they need to know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I understand, of course, that in the all-volunteer open source army, this

</I>
It's harder the smaller the community is, the only fact that we are discussing
about improving documentation means that the community is growing anyway.

&gt;<i>Many thanks, Valentino, for your thoughtful consideration of the issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Do you have the time and will to help me develop more Techno Turkey

</I>
I wouldn't mind helping out, hopefully the discussion can take place in this
mailing list so that other people (if they want) can help answering/completing/
fixing/evaluating what we write.

Thanks for bringing up this topic anyway.
