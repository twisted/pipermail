I got it to work, but I'm seeing some weirdness in several  
situations. I guess they would be classified &quot;regressions&quot;.

I seem to need this all of a sudden, so you are in luck. I will take  
a look at fixing the weirdness I see and try to fix it, and commit it  
to trunk soon.

&gt;<i> BTW, I'd also need &quot;context&quot; to be passed to the coerce method (as

</I>
It should be the first argument, for consistency. Also, to retain  
backwards compatibility, we could rename the &quot;coerce&quot; method which  
takes a context. Perhaps it could be named &quot;convert&quot;.

&gt;<i> I need the context in order to reach the session with
</I>&gt;<i> inevow.ISession(ctx) inside the coerce handler.
</I>
Indeed. formless was originally designed to be web-agnostic and be  
usable outside of nevow, but in this case I think it's compelling  
enough to allow it.
