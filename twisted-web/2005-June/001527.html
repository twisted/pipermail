I understand you are restricted to deploying a single .rpy script, so
all your code will have to be contained in that file. That's not a good
way to deploy a Twisted web app but you have no choice here.

&gt;<i>  How do I run it?  
</I>
Create and run a web.tap that serves files from the directory containing
your .rpy script.

&gt;<i> How do I test it?
</I>
Request the .rpy using your browser.

&gt;<i> There are a lot of code examples available, but very
</I>&gt;<i> little information on how they interact and call each other.  It doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> help that I am not too familiar with the OO-style API documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I know that I need to be creating a subclass of HTTPClient, and creating

</I>&gt;<i> create an instance of the HTTPClient subclass and use it to retrieve the
</I>&gt;<i> requested URL (we have to get it line by line), but I don't understand
</I>&gt;<i> how to create the instance.
</I>
Typically, you add a client protocol factory to the reactor, giving it a
host and port. However, the twisted.web.client module has some
convenient functions that will make things easier for you. See getPage
in that module for more detail.

&gt;<i> A single good example that creates a web proxy server which simply
</I>&gt;<i> retrieves the data line by line and displays it to the screen, plus the
</I>&gt;<i> shell commands needed to run/test would be extremely helpful.  I am
</I>&gt;<i> completely confused as to how the web server and .rpy file would interact.
</I>
Everything you need is in the &quot;Using twisted.web&quot; HOWTO which can be
found at <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/web/documentation/howto/.">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/web/documentation/howto/.</A>
Points of interest are:

  * .rpy (resource) scripts
  * creating and running a web.tap server
  * the twisted.web.client module
  * deferred resource rendering

&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I hope someone has the time and know-how to help me out.
</I>&gt;<i> THANKS
</I>
I realise that this reply is a little terse but I suspect part of the
class is working out how to put all this together ;-).

Good luck!

Cheers, Matt
