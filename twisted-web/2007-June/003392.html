You're right, and it's never been the plan to just leave my gripes 
(which are very few) with Nevow behind and fork an abstraction layer 
to hide them away.
The main issue is that I actually like the complexity behind Nevow, 
because it's not deceiving or limiting, ie - Once you can do Hello 
World, the rest is as difficult.

The main thing that a lot of people do ask for is boiler plate code - 
but mostly only when they are beginning. After this your 'boiler 
plate' starts to become much more application tuned. Of course, I 
would work on Mantissa but there needs to be less cohesion between it 
and Axiom and thats a scary job. You'll note pretty much each of the 
documentation pages on Enamel links at the bottom &quot;If you want to do 
more go to X and learn it properly&quot; sort of thing.

The other thing is that no-context needs to be completed before there 
is much point in commencing a wide scale rewrite of Nevows 
documentation. Someone also needs to rewrite Formal to play with 
no-context.

I am but one man :P

Expecting one person to deal with all your problems is like praying 
each time you require an ambulance: You'll eventually be dead long 
before you get a response.
