<PRE>I previously asked this on the main twisted mailing list and was directed to the twisted-web mailing list. 


What is the groups opinion on which web library to use as the basis of my system?

I've started the work using Twisted.Web, but would like a sanity check before I go too far down this path.

I have read the Web Development with Twisted article on the site which is part of the reason I'm looking for a sanity check. :-)  

I've also looked at Nevow, but that didn't seem to be what I'm looking for.  I have no UI/Templating needs.


The piece of a larger system that I'm working on is basically a generic communication bridge application that will allow various external systems to talk to our system.  The initial release of this system is implementing a simple HTTP GET Server that allows the external systems to use a URL to either send small amounts of data to or request data from our system.

Here is an example scenario:

Our bridge application would be installed on an interactive kiosk.  The kiosk presentation would be able to report usage data by calling a URL such as <A HREF="http://localhost:8000/ReportUsage?ScreenID=1234.">http://localhost:8000/ReportUsage?ScreenID=1234.</A>  The bridge application would receive this request, write it to a local data cache for later batch uploading to a central server.  The local HTTP Server would return a simple text, XML, or JSON response to the calling application to indicate success/failure of the request.

Eventually we want to have a variety of interfaces that are tailored to specific types of applications.  But for right now we're looking at implementing the lowest common denominator which is exchanging information via simple HTTP calls.

Traffic wise, all connections to this HTTP Server are via localhost.  There will be no external connections to.  The expected rate of requests is perhaps 1-2 requests every few seconds.


So getting back to my original question, is Twisted.Web or Twisted.Web2 the better framework to use in this case or is there another framework than Twisted that may work better?


NOTE: I'm working in Python 2.5 and Twisted 2.5 if that makes any difference. Primary development is being done on Linux but with the goal of being able to run on Linux, Windows, or Mac.

Thanks in advance for your suggestions and comments.

-Shawn
