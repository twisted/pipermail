<PRE>Scenario:&#160; TCP Receive Buffer on twisted HTTP server using the twisted application framework.&#160; And its behavior when set up as producer/consumer.


(1) Would like to set the receive buffer size on socket.&#160; One way to do this would be to create a derived class of TCPServer (or SSLServer) and set the buffer size and use derived class server in the .tac file.&#160; Would like to know if there is any sample code for such usage?&#160; For example, in which method of the derived class would one set the receive buffer size?


(2) When an incoming http POST request is acting as a producer of data, which is tied to a consumer resource (some other connection), how can I control the incoming tcp window size, if the consumer has paused consuming?&#160; I presume the incoming network data will keep piling up in the 'huge' tcp buffer eventually advertising a 'tcp zero window' to the network peer of the data producer, AND the server ends up using up a large amount of memory for the paused connection.&#160; Is there an alternative?&#160; I realize that the TCP protocol inhibits 'reducing of an already advertised receive window', but I am wondering if pauseProducing() on an http channel could do something to at least prevent the tcp window size from increasing any further?

Thank you,
Arun
