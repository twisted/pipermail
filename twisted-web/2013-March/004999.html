<PRE>I penned the questions at 3am, so please punt my second question since it is half-baked.&#160; Found some time this afternoon to revisit bulk-data flow discussion in Steven's book. &#160;

The first question still applies though.

Using the protocol's transport object, I can fetch the SO_RCVBUF value on the 'accepted' connection and even set the SO_SNDBUF value.&#160; However, since TCP Window scaling is enabled by default, it is my understanding that the SO_RCVBUF has to be set before the listen() call is invoked.&#160; The .tac file passes the TCPServer object to application/service framework, which in turn calls the listener.&#160; So I am wondering if I have to derive a subclass of TCPServer and somehow set the SO_RCVBUF value before the application framework invokes listen();&#160; i.e. drill down to the Port object where it calls createInternetSocket()?

Scenario:&#160; TCP Receive Buffer on twisted HTTP server using the twisted application framework.&#160; And its behavior when set up as producer/consumer.

</I>&gt;<i>(1) Would like to set the receive buffer size on socket.&#160; One way to do this would be to create a derived class of TCPServer (or SSLServer) and set the buffer size and use derived class server in the .tac file.&#160; Would like to know if there is any sample code for such usage?&#160; For example, in which method of the derived class would one set the receive buffer size?
</I>
You don't need to subclass these classes; and in any event, it wouldn't help, TCPServer and SSLServer don't have connections of their own, they're services that hold listening sockets, not connected sockets. &#160;If you want to set an option unsupported by Twisted, &quot;transport.getHandle()&quot; will give you the Python socket object (on those reactors which use socket objects internally, which is most of them). &#160;You can just set SO_RCVBUF on that socket from your Protocol class.

Also, this ticket may be of interest to you: &lt;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4089">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4089</A>&gt;. &#160;Tuning send and receive buffers should&#160;be more explicitly supported by Twisted.

(2) When an incoming http POST request is acting as a producer of data, which is tied to a consumer resource (some other connection), how can I control the incoming tcp window size, if the consumer has paused consuming?&#160; I presume the incoming network data will keep piling up in the 'huge' tcp buffer eventually advertising a 'tcp zero window' to the network peer of the data producer, AND the server ends up using up a large amount of memory for the paused connection.&#160; Is there an alternative?&#160; I realize that the TCP protocol inhibits 'reducing of an already advertised receive window', but I am wondering if pauseProducing() on an http channel could do something to at least prevent the tcp window size from increasing any further?
&gt;<i>

I don't know that much about window scaling, but won't the fact that the application isn't receiving any data from the kernel automatically prevent the window from scaling any bigger?
