</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     off list just for my information, what version of nevow/athena do
</I>&gt;<i>     have you have included in enamel. The latest fixes I sent back to
</I>&gt;<i>     the divmod list solved bugs server and client side when detaching
</I>&gt;<i>     Live Elements from a page, which I do habitually very often.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Enamel works on pretty much any version, but doesn't work with
</I>&gt;<i> contextless Page and other stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The motivator for it's creation was to increase dev speed with people
</I>&gt;<i> who were slightly useless, and to act as a wrapper to make code trees
</I>&gt;<i> that could survive Freeze.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     What do you see as important areas where nevow/athena should be
</I>&gt;<i>     improved?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Primarily there is a great deal of bootstrapping. Just create a simple
</I>&gt;<i> web-app (without something like Methanal or Mantissa, which I can't even
</I>&gt;<i> understand) that does Athena and see how much code you're rewriting
</I>&gt;<i> every time, it's quite insane.
</I>My boilerplate (me working with guys mostly doing PHP and MySQL) let's me
start up a new project in less than an hour. Doing this for a living I 
see the problem not really in starting up projects fast, but in 
finishing them fast, because only finished projects are paying...

&gt;<i> Also if you're not using Twisted plugins (which there are many reasons
</I>&gt;<i> not to want to, like using shared state reactors with multiple TCP
</I>&gt;<i> services, or again Freeze) the pain goes up double.
</I>I use only a single plugin in nevow letting me bootstrap easily and 
providing
a clean mechanism to switch automagically between source/compressed 
deployment version. All the deployment is handled via SVN.

&gt;<i> Essentially boiling Athena down to a page mixin class with standard js
</I>&gt;<i> bootstraps, and/or separate fragment mixin and making all pages derive
</I>&gt;<i> the necessary Athena object triggers or even putting that into flatten.
</I>Might be that there's need for a 'kiddy' version, letting the average
interested user who does not have the time to look into a framework and
its concepts and wants to whip up a page in less than 30 seconds.

&gt;<i> You can see what I do here to try simplify things for the way I work,
</I>&gt;<i> essentially I just stick an elements class dict in and map fragments to
</I>&gt;<i> automatically created renderers and stuff works magically.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://open.thusa.net/enamel/browser/trunk/enamel/pages.py#L126">http://open.thusa.net/enamel/browser/trunk/enamel/pages.py#L126</A>
</I>I see the basic idea, no objection, but why Fragments and not Elements?

&gt;<i> There's also issues with the current model, like your root resource
</I>&gt;<i> can't be an Athena page very easily.
</I>I don't understand this point, I usually work root only, with not a 
standard page change, but doing everything by attaching/detaching live 
elements (see http;//www.thieprojects.ch for work in progress for a 
simple Desktop like RIA)
