I'm running on a merge of nevow/athena with qooxdoo bringing RIA 
development really to live.

Just to throw some figures around, rewriting my card game platform with 
that approach I was able to shed about 70% of the code on the client 
side, not a single line of HTML or CSS - plain, clean JScript instead, 
with browser compatibility across every thing existing starting from the 
times IE6 ruled. Server side code shrinkage with isolating game logic 
with pb is around 60%, the whole rewriting took about 1/10th of the 
original implementation time, meaning this was the biggest gain I've 
ever seen in productivity since I started dabbling with code in 1972.

All in all, I'm probably already stuck with nevow/athena, but would 
commit to it any time again. So let's make nevow/athena better.

Another 2cts, Werner
