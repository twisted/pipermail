The problem is that your boilerplate wasn't a part you wrote in an
hour, and it's not something everyone can pick up and use.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, I use plugins quite a lot (after all, they exist for a reason),
and I don't use SVN. The point is that I write a bunch of servers and
the web-exposed part constitutes 10%, if not less, in a single setup.
Hence, all the divmod'esque stuff with Mantissa and friends is an
overkill, but trying to do everything on top of plain t.web leaves a
bad feeling of reimplementing Nevow.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The truth (maybe sad one) is that there are still areas where a simple
generated HTML with AJAX interactions sprinkled here and there is the
optimal thing. And sometimes all you want is throw away your old PHP
frontend to some pythonic monster and bring it all together to a
single code base, without much rethinking of the interaction model.
