Subject: [Twisted-web] Behaviour on Stopping Reactor
Message-ID: <CAMyKuCOX-eJf7btpRaOebYM=bDD5KfTUZF+fBciVCPwJJg82PA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I used following two libraries for udp listener

*from twisted.internet.protocol import DatagramProtocol*
*from twisted.internet import reactor*

When I do reactor.stop(), it processes all the buffered datagram packets.
That's fine but it should close the socket connection as well so that it
doesn't listen for any new packet. What's happening in my case is that
socket is getting a lot of packets continuously. If *reactor.stop()* is
called, the process doesn't exit because it's still getting packets from
the socket connection. Is this behaviour kept intentionally or we can
change it?

â€ŒRegards
Rohit Laddha
