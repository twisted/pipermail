<PRE>I'm going to back up Richard and Ed, because I feel like people might be
inclined to just pass their emails by. This is very important.

Here we have two users who are expressing serious reservations about
using Twisted or Nevow because they don't have any details on how we
plan to split twisted.web. I can understand their concern: nobody likes
being in the dark.

I know there's already a long thread where ideas were bounced around,
but I think -- for the sake of keeping interested parties interested
(nod to Richard and Ed) -- it would be helpful if someone who is
directly involved in the split answers a few things right here:

1) What will happen to twisted.web? It's a complex module, and doing
reverse-imports (the way LowDown is doing with twisted.news) might get
pretty rocky. Do we have any guarantees that, for the foreseeable
future, the existing twisted.web will not change, and people can
continue to develop applications using twisted.web?

2) When everything's finished, how drastically different will the APIs
be? Are we talking about a simple &quot;move code over, clean up a few loose
ends,&quot; or is this going to be a massive reorganization and refactoring
of everything web-related?

And, most importantly...

3) What sort of timeframe are we looking at?

Really, I think everyone is most interested in the last question. How
long will the split take? If it's going to happen gradually over several
months, what should people who are considering using twisted.web or
Nevow do? If it's going to happen in the next two weeks... well, then,
it's about time someone stood up and said so!

I'm saying we need more public information about a split, because it's
starting to affect the user community. I think the best thing to do
would be a page on the Wiki, answering exactly these questions, where
everyone can go to get the latest scoop on what's planned (and what's
still undecided).

Wiki: &lt;<A HREF="http://divmod.org/users/wiki.twistd/nevow/moin.cgi">http://divmod.org/users/wiki.twistd/nevow/moin.cgi</A>&gt;

So, please, someone who's directly involved with the split, we need to
hear more about plans, soon.
