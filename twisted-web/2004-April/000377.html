One point I'd like to make is that Nevow has, since its inception, been 
pretty API-unstable. *twisted.web* has been stable for a while, and 
there's no reason not to use it. Nevow is obviously still something you 
need to watch closely if you want to use.

I promise there will be backwards compatibility for twisted.web. I'll 
explain more below...

&gt;<i> 1) What will happen to twisted.web? It's a complex module, and doing
</I>&gt;<i> reverse-imports (the way LowDown is doing with twisted.news) might get
</I>&gt;<i> pretty rocky. Do we have any guarantees that, for the foreseeable

</I>&gt;<i> continue to develop applications using twisted.web?
</I>
'from twisted import web' *will remain backwards compatible*. I'll 
personally see to that. :-)

&gt;<i> 2) When everything's finished, how drastically different will the APIs
</I>&gt;<i> be? Are we talking about a simple &quot;move code over, clean up a few loose
</I>&gt;<i> ends,&quot; or is this going to be a massive reorganization and refactoring
</I>&gt;<i> of everything web-related?
</I>
That's a question that foom and nevow-twisted.web-forkers can answer. 
nevow changed a bunch of core twisted.web stuff, and foom is rewriting 
the HTTP support.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And, most importantly...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) What sort of timeframe are we looking at?
</I>
Ha! I mock your assumptions that someone actually has any idea. ;-)

&gt;<i> Really, I think everyone is most interested in the last question. How
</I>&gt;<i> long will the split take? If it's going to happen gradually over several
</I>&gt;<i> months, what should people who are considering using twisted.web or
</I>&gt;<i> Nevow do? If it's going to happen in the next two weeks... well, then,
</I>&gt;<i> it's about time someone stood up and said so!
</I>
twisted.web split is going to be tricky, since people are rewriting it 
at the same time. It will probably be a short while before the split 
actually occurs, and we're probably going to have to put a bunch of BC 
code in twisted/web/.

But like I said, people shouldn't worry about using *twisted.web*. It 
will remain backwards compatible. I can't say anything about the 
backwards compatibility of all the slightly different APIs in nevow; 
that's not my concern.
