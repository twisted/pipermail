You did thank you.

&gt;<i> Heh heh -- LDAP support isn't in Twisted proper (Ldaptor is a third

</I>&gt;<i> is proof that your worrying about coherency isn't justified.
</I>
Could not have provided you with a better argument if I had been looking 
for one ;-)

&gt;<i> Twisted is currently very hard to maintain, for us. For *you*, the 
</I>&gt;<i> only change is that you'll have to 'apt-get install twisted-web' as 
</I>&gt;<i> well as 'apt-get install twisted'. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I think you're overreacting; the coherency of the quality and 
</I>&gt;<i> integration of Twisted projects is not going to be lessened by this 
</I>&gt;<i> breakup (we're breaking out a lot more than twisted-web: conch, flow, 
</I>&gt;<i> lore, protocols, they're all being split up).
</I>
Sorry if I looked that way ;-) I am not.
I just did not realised what you were really wanting to do, I should 
folllow the list more closely but time is missing me.
