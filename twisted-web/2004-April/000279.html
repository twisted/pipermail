<PRE>***  Probably not a problem with Twisted...  see my last comments ***

&gt;<i> Well, any open source tester, even a simple dodgy one you write
</I>&gt;<i> yourself --
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have any strong preference, but it would be nice to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> reproduce your results :)
</I>
Well, I've attempted to write a script in python to do this, but, I'm not
seeing the performance difference when I run it (It performs well, whether
it's 1.0 or 1.1.  Actually, it performs slightly BETTER if it's 1.1, but
only about 10%)!  After rubbing my eyes, and trying again (and again, and
again....)  I've concluded that I'm NOT losing my mind (the perf degradation
is very real and noticable when loading/refreshing a page with lot's of
small images), but for some reason, the way httplib constructs an HTTP/1.1
request doesn't trigger it (while ACT, Internet Explorer, and Mozilla 1.7b
do trigger it)

&gt;<i> I can't think of what else to suggest, except for running the
</I>&gt;<i> server in the
</I>&gt;<i> Python profiler (the -p=profile.log switch to twistd, if you're using it),
</I>&gt;<i> and seeing if that reveals where the extra time is being spent.
</I>
Hmm...  I'm not running twistd, but maybe I can do something along those
lines in my script that kicks Twisted off...  It already has some profiling
bootstrap code in it.  I hate wading through all the profiler output, but at
least this may be easy to spot, since it's so dramatic.

&gt;<i> Maybe you could insert a &quot;print repr(line)&quot; into HTTPChannel's
</I>&gt;<i> lineReceiver
</I>&gt;<i> handler (see twisted/protocols/http.py) to get a more raw dump of the
</I>&gt;<i> request, and double-check that there's no significant differences in the
</I>&gt;<i> HTTP/1.0 vs. HTTP/1.1 requests, but I'm doubtful...
</I>
Another good suggestion.  I don't know where that is at the moment, but I'm
sure it'll be easy to find once I dig/grep for it.  I assume that's a pretty
low level spot in twisted's comm stack?

&gt;<i> Also, to eliminate another difference between your environment
</I>&gt;<i> and mine, is
</I>&gt;<i> it possible to run your tester against a Twisted server on a
</I>&gt;<i> linux box, and
</I>&gt;<i> verify that it still gives the same behaviour?  If for some bizarre reason
</I>&gt;<i> it turns out to be a windows-only issue, it'd be good to know
</I>&gt;<i> before I waste
</I>&gt;<i> too much time trying to reproduce it on Linux :)
</I>
Actually, I am running it on a Linux box.  Of course I ran ACT from a
windows box, but they're sitting next to each other on a 100mbps lan.  The
data transfer rate was not a factor (Apache on Linux can hand about 500
images / second to the windows box).  I'm using Python 2.3 on SuSE 8.1 with
a 2.4.24 kernel (I compiled it myself, but I haven't had any troubles with
it -- that I know of ;) )


&gt;<i> Also, I'm losing track of what you have and haven't tried... it might be
</I>&gt;<i> time we opened a bug report for this, so we can track this properly.
</I>
I'd be up for that, but I'd really like to see at least one other person
duplicate it before we went that far.  I may just have something stupid
going on over here.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Ok, you know what?  I'm starting to think it's a not a problem intrinsic
with twisted.  I just put together a html page with 100 small images, and
served it through the Qx / Twisted combo and it was slow.  Through Qx /
Medusa, it was fast.  Through Twisted by itself, it was fast (using Moz
1.7b).  Here's the script I used:

#!/usr/bin/python
from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.web import static, server

root = static.File(
  &quot;/home/jsibre/programs/python/sitehostApp/sitehost/web/static/test&quot;)
reactor.listenTCP(8082, server.Site(root))
reactor.run()

It ran really fast, all images loaded in about a second (through the Qx /
Twisted combo, you can watch them load one after the other...  Takes about 8
or 9 seconds).

I was afraid of this... It's probably something in the glue that ties the Qx
to Twisted.  I'll work it from that angle for a while and see if I find a
problem that is fixable, and provide the fix to the Qx folks when I figure
it out.

Thanks for your help, Andrew.

Jason
