Have you tried using NevowSite, but giving it one of your custom
resources instead of a nevow.rend.Page instance? I'm not sure whether
that will work or not, but I don't see why it shouldn't. NevowSite is
just a subclass of t.w.server.Site, which you need anyways.

The main thing about NevowSite is that it converts everything to
inevow.IResource instead of t.w.resource.IResource. This means support
for both &quot;old&quot; resources, like yours, and for Nevow's own resources. So
you're getting more by usingi t, and there's very little additional
overhead.

&gt;<i> Nifty trick with the deferred and the gotRenderedPage() callback. I'm
</I>&gt;<i> still having trouble getting my mind around deferred so thats helpful.
</I>
You'll see deferreds all over Twisted. They're very useful, sometimes
essential, in a framework where you don't always know everything at
once.

&gt;<i> Can you expand a bit on how the remember() calls are helpful? 
</I>
They're essential. Normally they get called in Page.renderHTTP, but they
aren't there in renderString. 

(Anyone, is this a bug? Is there a reason they're not in renderString?)
