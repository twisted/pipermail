Well, it's pretty much already decided to do this. But hopefully I'll be 
able to explain why this isn't a bad thing.

&gt;<i> Twisted is the best &quot;glue&quot; framework I have ever seen (it allow us to

</I>&gt;<i> /coherent/ manner.
</I>
Heh heh -- LDAP support isn't in Twisted proper (Ldaptor is a third 
party package). You still cite it as coherent with the framework! This 
is proof that your worrying about coherency isn't justified.

&gt;<i> It allowed us to develop our internal tools not like a patch of
</I>&gt;<i> etherogenous scripts but like something coherent, easy to maintain
</I>&gt;<i> and improve as nearly everything we needed was already there.
</I>
Twisted is currently very hard to maintain, for us. For *you*, the only 
change is that you'll have to 'apt-get install twisted-web' as well as 
'apt-get install twisted'. :-)

&gt;<i> To provide you some background, our web server is currently
</I>&gt;<i> implemented using woven - so my opinion may be biased but we are
</I>&gt;<i> planning to port our code to Nevow when/if it is integrated. Having
</I>&gt;<i> the code of Nevow/Woven in the twisted tree mean that people using it
</I>&gt;<i> are sure that it is kept in sync by the automatic build test and I
</I>&gt;<i> think it is important that it stays here.
</I>
Nevow is definitely never going to be integrated with Twisted.

&gt;<i> Now should you think that the old code should be replaced, I would
</I>&gt;<i> suggest that you leave the current web code here, for people like me
</I>&gt;<i> using it, but create a new www section (or whatever name)
</I>
Yeah, we'll probably leave the existing stuff in Twisted for a while, 
with a deprecation warning to use the new packages.

&gt;<i> ...
</I>
Anyway, I think you're overreacting; the coherency of the quality and 
integration of Twisted projects is not going to be lessened by this 
breakup (we're breaking out a lot more than twisted-web: conch, flow, 
lore, protocols, they're all being split up).

These will still be Twisted &quot;official&quot; projects. They will still be 
coherent. The reason we're doing this is to make maintaining and 
releasing easier. Twisted is just too huge and has too many parts of 
differing stability to make it practical to keep it together.
