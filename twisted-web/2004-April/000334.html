<PRE>Thanks for the input!

I've been working on this one project in my spare time for 3 years now 
-- an online concerts database, cross-referencing cities artists genres 
venues, everything you could imagine, and sending weekly emails based 
on your interests.

I got it  up and running, pretty quickly, in php/mysql 3 years ago -- 
except it was ungodly slow.  Part because of poor design on my fault, 
part because of  the  tools I chose.

Two years  ago, I recoded it into procedural perl and made a lot of 
headway in optimizing it.

One year ago, I recoded it into object oriented perl under mod_perl, 
and had even bigger gains in speed and use.

About the same time though, I started using Python a lot more.  Now, I 
rarely use  anything else.  So I'm trying to code it again, in twisted 
and postgres, for a few reasons:
   1 - i could touch perl a whole lot less, and deal with more 
readable/editable code that i write way faster
   2 - i didn't like the  memory usage of what I had under mod_perl 
(likely  because of my errors, but twisted would be more strict and 
make me keep in line) -- having a single daemon that handles all the 
code just seems smarter and more efficient.

I'd be interested in your approach to caching.  While the bulk of what 
I see this project going is dynamic, certain elements and templates are 
static -- and the constant reading off of disk seems excessive.
