The failing with &gt; 10MB is intentional, but the hanging is not. It's  
supposed to return an error response to the client. In fileupload.py: 
233, parseMultipartFormData has arguments which limit the number of  
fields and the size of the uploaded data. The default limit for size  
is 10MB.

Unfortunately, it looks like there is no way to pass in different  
limits to fileupload.parseMultipartFormData from where it's called in  
server.parsePOSTData.

So there's two bugs here:
1) hangs instead of returning a response.
2) limit is not configurable.
