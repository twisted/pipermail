</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Ok I could do that I think (presume use same method used for twisted 9.0 which I willl have to look into to see what they did)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> File &quot;/Users/gas/src/py/twisted/axiom-

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>        exceptions.ImportError: cannot import name provisioning
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm guess you tried to follow 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/MantissaWikiTutorial">http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/MantissaWikiTutorial</A>&gt;.  Quite some time 
</I>&gt;<i> ago, I added a warning to the top of that page indicating that the 
</I>&gt;<i> tutorial is broken.  So, don't look at it.
</I>
yeah I know its broken however my issues is the installation of mantissa is broken so even though I am trying to decipher a broken tutorial my installation is mantissa install is broken from setup hence I cant progress. If I could get a hint on what i needed to look at to fix mantissa install (issue in setup that has been deleted form this post)  then maybe I could make progress ?
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This leaves us with the question of what documentation you ''should'' 
</I>&gt;<i> look at.  This highlights a major problem with Mantissa - its near lack 
</I>&gt;<i> of documentation.  I don't think anything really exists to help a 
</I>&gt;<i> beginning get up to speed with things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry about that.
</I>No worries - if I can get past setup issue then I would know errors are my lack of understanding..


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So my questions are - being a twisted and web NOB seeing Divmod 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> died/disbanded (I think  6 months ago?) and Mantissa doesnt look like 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> its been touched for 2 years, and Nevow??? --- I'm not sure what is 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> strategy if you want to develop a web app with twisted?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You will probably be able to find some assistance in #divmod on 
</I>&gt;<i> irc.freenode.net, as several people (myself included) with Mantissa 
</I>&gt;<i> experience still frequent that channel.  Additionally, Mantissa 
</I>&gt;<i> development is still underway, although at a very languid pace, so it's 
</I>&gt;<i> possible documentation will appear at some point.  The best way for this 
</I>&gt;<i> to happen is for more people to pitch in, though. ;)
</I>I hear your hint however my help would probably be a hindrance but will try. Need to get off company network to access IRC which is pain..


&gt;<i>  Divmod may be 
</I>&gt;<i> gone, but Mantissa and the related libraries are and always have been 
</I>&gt;<i> open source projects - anyone is welcome to help, and such help is 
</I>&gt;<i> needed for the projects to survive.
</I>
Ok will I will help if you throw me a morcel on where I should look to fix mantissa setup issue ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Do I continue and try and work out the code for Mantissa (which I 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> doubt Im capable of being a programming NOB), try to do it via Nevow 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or go back to JPs web in 60 second tutorial and work out a web 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> application from there?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whether the effort of learning Mantissa will ultimately be worthwhile or 
</I>&gt;<i> not depends on what kind of application you intend to develop.  It may 
</I>&gt;<i> be that Mantissa isn't even particularly applicable to your problem 
</I>&gt;<i> space, in which case looking at Twisted Web or Nevow directly would make 
</I>&gt;<i> more sense.  
</I>All it is are some pet projects where I store some data in a database about exercise I have done/planned or club members and that I have authenticated access to some pages that have confidential information (for club) I could probably do it it django but would like to keep on twisted learning curve ie testing before writing
&gt;<i> Or it could be exactly the other way around.  However, at 
</I>&gt;<i> the very least, Mantissa is quite heavily based on Nevow, so learning 
</I>&gt;<i> Nevow is going to be a benefit to you no matter way.  And once you have 
</I>&gt;<i> some Nevow familiarity, the learning curve for Mantissa might not look 
</I>&gt;<i> so steep.
</I>
Ok so nevow still adds on web ie it has stan and athena, do these sit on top of web or does nevow have its own web implementation?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Any pointers most appreciated
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Gas
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> PS mucked around and got Combinator going which i liked however if you 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are developing a Mantissa app then combinator didnt work as you really 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> needed too install mantissa and all its dependencies so you could get 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> access to the axiomatic script or did I miss something? Is that the 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> issue with Combinator that if python source installs scripts you still 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> need to install the source in your site-packages? So is Combinator 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> still valid or shall I look at things like bzr and use same Twisted 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> development method ie of branches?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Combinator lets you skip the installation step.  I'm not sure if you 
</I>&gt;<i> figured that out or not.
</I>Yeha I did however issue is it doesnt for mantissa (I think) as you need to install to get the axiomatic script (well i think you do cause I couldn't find it in mantissa source?) so I could play arounf with broken tutorials or is aximoatic hidden somewhere diffferent than in Mantissa ?

&gt;<i>  Surprisingly, I'd say that the combinator 
</I>&gt;<i> tutorial (&lt;<A HREF="http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/CombinatorTutorial">http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/CombinatorTutorial</A>&gt;) is worth 
</I>&gt;<i> reading, if you haven't seen it already.  Otherwise, perhaps I've 
</I>&gt;<i> totally misunderstood your question. :)
</I>No I got that to work but just had issue above with mantissa

thanks for the prompt reply
