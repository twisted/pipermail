Hi,


        So, can you help me out with small issue now? While creating
xml-rpc twisted server, can I assin ip-address and port where I want to
deploy server finally?

What I mean is : I want to keep my server at ipadress1 , port1. I wrote
some code on my localhost. One way is to put this server code on some
computer which is on i[adress1, port1. Is there any way to associate our
server to listen on  ipaddress1 and port1 by running on my computer itself.

In server code, when I start the service, only port is there and no ip
adress is required.


"   s = strports.service('ssl:'+port+'
:privateKey='+privateKey+':certKey='+certKey, channel.HTTPFactory(site))
      return s
"

Thanks,
Vinod

I'm not sure I fully understand your question.  I don't think so, though.

No.  That's nothing to do with Twisted, it's just how routing works on the internet.

> In server code, when I start the service, only port is there and no ip adress is required.

That's correct.  So if you move your code to a new server, you shouldn't have to change it to listen on a different IP.

By the way, Vinod, I noticed that you blasted out copies of this message to a whole bunch of mailing lists on twistedmatrix.com.  Most of these lists have nothing to do with your question.  In the future, please just ask on twisted-python or twisted-web, and then be patient.

If you want professional support for Twisted there are people who offer it, but unless you choose to pay for it nobody is obliged to answer your questions.

Hi,

can somebody point me to some examples about how to do form based authentication in twisted.web? I'm just getting started with twisted.web, because I want to implement some async web stuff. So far I really like it, because the handling of resources is quite similar to CherryPy, which I like too. But I was not able to find some up to date information about authentication and authorization in twisted.web. Any hint would be very appreciated.

cheers,
Achim

You could look at https://github.com/minskmaz/txWebAuth for an example of how to do form-based auth using twisted.cred and twisted.web.  The code is pretty raw, but it should at least give you an idea of what to do.

Hope this helps,

Daniel
