<PRE>Well, I see your point, but do not necessarily agree.

As a mostly Java guy (that's what I do at work 90% of the time), I deal
daily with the complexity of these dozens of tiny little libs that you can
assemble...as a result my Maven pom.xml file is hundreds of lines long.

There is something to be said about an &quot;all batteries included&quot; approach
that handles 80% of the most common use cases out of the box. Handling the
other 20% often entails so much more additional complexity, that maybe it's
just better to leave it to a hand-rolled solution anyway.

Django rolls a lot of things into one complete package...and that is the
reason we are slowly moving all of our Java / .Net code to it (for web
development). There is value to this level of integration, even if it
doesn't do everything for everybody.

</I>&gt;<i> they face would be supporting two different process management
</I>&gt;<i> infrastuctures instead of one, or support two libraries which basically do
</I>&gt;<i> one thing, instead of one library. This is going to be at least as twice as
</I>&gt;<i> expensive, if not even more expensive if you ever try to glue those things
</I>&gt;<i> together and get them to play nicely with one another.
