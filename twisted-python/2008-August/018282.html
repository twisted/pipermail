<PRE>Hello all,

Launchpad has recently released a Trac plugin that lets Launchpad
synchronize bugs and bug comments from Launchpad to Trac and vice
versa.

Can we please install this on our Trac?

Howdy, warthogs,

I'm writing to you to ask for help with testing some cool new features
that we're going to be adding to Launchpad shortly.

We've developed (well, we've contracted people to develop) plugins for
Bugzilla and Trac that allow bidirectional communication between
Launchpad and the remote bug trackers that have them installed.

As I said, we need some help testing these plugins. Specifically, we need to
have them installed on a number of remote bug trackers so that we can use the
plugins to communicate with those trackers.

If you know of any bug trackers whose administrators might be interested
in helping us out (or, even better, if you're one of those
administrators yourself),
please point them to the following pages on the help wiki, which will
explain how
to download and install the Launchpad plugins:

For Bugzilla: <A HREF="http://help.launchpad.net/Bugs/BugzillaPlugin">http://help.launchpad.net/Bugs/BugzillaPlugin</A>
For Trac: <A HREF="http://help.launchpad.net/Bugs/TracPlugin">http://help.launchpad.net/Bugs/TracPlugin</A>

Installing one of the plugins means that:

 * Launchpad will be able to forward bugs to upstream bug trackers that
  have the plugin installed. Users of those bug trackers won't have to
  check Launchpad for bugs registered against their project; they'll be
  forwarded straight to the upstream tracker.

 * If a bug watch is created against an upstream bug, Launchpad will
  tell the upstream bug tracker which Launchpad bug is watching it.
  This means that not only is there a link in Launchpad to the upstream
  bug, but there's also a link in the upstream bug tracker to the
  Launchpad bug.

 * Launchpad will be able to import comments from upstream bugs which
  are being watched in Launchpad. If you register a bug watch against
  an upstream bug you'll be able to read the conversation about that
  bug on Launchpad, including the comments that are made on the
  upstream bug tracker.

 * Launchpad will be able to push comments to upstream bugs which are
  linked to a Launchpad bug, so if you add a comment on Launchpad in
  reply to a comment which was imported from an upstream bug tracker,
  the comment will automatically be added to the conversation on the
  upstream bug tracker, too. This means that users of both Launchpad
  and the upstream tracker can view the whole conversation about the
  bug without leaving their preferred environments.

If you've got any further questions, please feel free to ask me.

Thanks in advance for your help,

Graham
