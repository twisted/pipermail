<PRE>Update: I went through the queue and gardened it substantially. There were a bunch of tickets where folks had forgotten to remove the review keyword upon closure, some with malformatted commit messages so they weren't closed (this is very hard to enforce mechanically, but please, use the template in the PR boilerplate), and some with merge conflicts that needed addressing before review.

I also pushed the &quot;update branch&quot; button on a whole lot of PRs so hopefully some CI detritus that made tests fail for spurious reasons will be cleared out, and everything will be reasonably up to date.

We are now down to 17 matches, but this does give me a commanding lead on this month's leaderboard:



I look forward to being dethroned.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello Twisted friends,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is just a friendly reminder that <A HREF="https://twisted.reviews">https://twisted.reviews</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://twisted.reviews/">https://twisted.reviews/</A>&gt; is full to bursting - 34 open reviews right now, some dating back as far as May of last year.  If you've got a few free minutes, can you find a ticket on that list and review the associated PR?  (I recently fixed the report so it's actually in the order you should review them...)  A short review queue is a happy review queue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Remember also that this isn't for nothing, if you do code reviews on Twisted you get internet points and bragging rights, at <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/">https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/">https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This isn't just for project members; if you did not already know, the rule is that if you're a project member you can review anything, but if you're an external contributor, you can review submissions by project members (and it's up to them to decide if your review is adequate before acting on it).  Project members (should) have a &quot;*&quot; next to their name in the &quot;submitted by&quot; list.  (If they don't I think someone needs to go manually update a list of strings, feel free to report issues if that's wrong.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Happy hacking,
