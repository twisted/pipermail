Thanks Glyph and Thomas and Tom for the release notes feedback.

I was thinking that 21.7.0  is ready for the final review.

PR at <A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1614">https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1614</A>

I am doing some fast-tracking here (as I now have some time)

But while writing this email, the python 3.8 and 3.9 version on GitHub VMs
were updates and we now have broken tests in trunk and in the release branch

The release blocking ticket was created at
<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/10230">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/10230</A>

Please see if you can help with unlocking the release.
Thomas is already helping.
Either fix the issue, or decide if it's ok to release with this issue.

There was also another minor idna pypy update release blocker that was
already fixed by Thomas.

I was planning to push the final release on Saturday 17 of July, to allow
for a full 1 week of feedback for the release candidate.

---------

There is also a PR for updating the release docs -
