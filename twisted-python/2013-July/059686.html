<PRE>Hi,

Firstly, thanks for this gist, I had done a few experiments using
endpoints and I think this is definitely the way to go for this code.

As to the questions: source and destination are parameters for the job
and might change between runs (a function I didn't include for brevity
handles computation of these). Interval was to be the time passed to
LoopingCall and type_req was another job parameter.

I agree that, having looked at the gist, trying to pack everything into
one Protocol was not the best way to go and using a separate protocol
for each type of communication (ie, getjob, retrievejob) is more sensible.

Thanks for helping me out with this, Twisted is slowly starting to make
sense now.

Cheers,
-Nick.
