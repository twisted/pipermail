My name is Kevin Smith, I'm new to the list.  I've been playing around with TwistedMatrix and it looks pretty powerful.

I was wondering if there is a way to telnet into inheritance?

So far I've only figured out how to run it directly.

Thanks in advance for your help.

You're going to want to run
'gnusto build_map game.rpl out.py'
'mkrealityserver game.rpl game.spl'
'twistd -f game.spl'

This will start a number of services, one of them being a telnet server
on port 8888. telnet in and log in with your username and password.
twistd will also start an experimental web server interface on port 8080,
and a gloop server on 8889 (for faucets like gtkfaucet, jfaucet, and tkfaucet).

If you would like to have an 'administration' interface through telnet, call
twistd with this instead: 'twistd -f game.spl -t 4040'. That will start
a telnet server on port 4040 as well, which you can telnet to (username 'admin'
password 'admin') and execute arbitrary Python statements. This is a great way
to learn about TPy. You'll want to import __main__ at first, and use dir()
a lot. :)

Thanks.  I was able to telnet in to port 8888, user Damien, password admin and start mucking around the mud.  

The web server works from lynx but not from IE, it doesn't seem to be accepting the session variable.

I tried the 'twistd -f game.spl -t 4040' but it was rejected at the command line.

Right now I'm trying to figure out how it connects the telnet session to the mud.  It looks to be through 

telnetServer = plumbing.Spigot(reality._default, selector)

Are there any more resources, other than the code and api doc to look for some simpler examples?

I've started writing some tutorial-like documentation on developing web apps

TPy so it should go into TwistedPython.

Also, I'm using HTML because that's what all the rest of the docs are in. If
anyone has a suggestion for another format feel free.

Also, I just committed my refactorings to reality, so if you're having

Put it into TwistedPython/doc, and if we decide we want to distribute it
separately later we can worry about it then.

There are 2 comments I'd like to make about tutorial-style documentation.

1: Try to make an example that shows how to do something *useful*.  My
"cat" tutorial is a gentle parody of all those other tutorials that show
you how to abstractly do an object-oriented taxonomy of a cat; I plan
(hopefully) to have lots of interesting "cookbook" style examples which
describe useful things that you'd probably want to do in an actual program
(like connecting your cat to the web, netnews, a twisted reality game and
a custom cat-control protocol).  I suggest that you do the same... or
perhaps even integrate with the "cat" theme :)

2: Take a look at WebWare.  Don't re-build any of that functionality.  I'd
really like to have WebWare be the standard way of doing DB interaction,
etc, from twisted web... I think that a twisted protocols tutorial or
something similiar would be a good idea.  Since this "integration" should
be trivial (I just haven't had enough time for it lately) if you find that
you need to re-build bits of webware for your tutorial try integrating it
first :-)

A TR tutorial would also be really helpful.

> Also, I'm using HTML because that's what all the rest of the docs are in. If

Yes.

At this point, still very few people use reality, and I'm working on other
things, so you probably won't hear much :)

Does anyone else think there should be a release? of course we're not
ready for 0.9.0 (or what we wanted for 0.9.0), but there have been many
changes and it's been a month since the last release. So, maybe we should
either change our release schedule for 0.9.0, or release a 0.8.10?

I'm working on a generic namespace browser. I've just committed a prototype
to TwistedPython/twisted/explorer.py (after much fretting of glyph and I over
what it should be named), and would like some suggestions. I'm
going to be taking a look at Squeak's browser again to get some ideas, but I'm
not a veteran squeak hacker, so I probably won't grok it as much as some other
people *cough*dash*cough* ;-)

Anyway, the gist of it is that I want a generic ObjectBrowser that can call
methods of, get attributes of, and execute arbitrary code in arbitrary
namespaces. Eventually a reality, web, and 3d UI are planned, and I think
there is a very interesting possibility of using it for the configuration
interface.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0106302021320.15953-100000@zaibach.twistedmatrix.com>

Apologies for the dearth of information on the mailing list and releases
lately.  I've been working on a new job, visiting my family, and some
other things.  However, I have been pouring quite a bit of effort into
Twisted Python as well.  The most exciting new development is Perspective
Broker, the erstwhile replacement for Gloop; I'm currently starting to
remove the old gloop-protocols in .web and .reality and replace them with
the newer, more robust perspective protocol.  Perspective Broker is more
than just a more robust Gloop, though; it's a culmination of all my
thinking about XML-RPC, CORBA, PyRO, and RMI.  The first application that
uses it to its full potential won't be available for a while, but trust
me, it'll be cool :-) 

Chris Armstrong has been doing a first-class job taking care of some
structural refactorings that needed to be done to make twisted.web and
twisted.reality worthwhile; although this doesn't meet our stated release
goals for 0.9.0, I really think that this release is worthy of a major
version bump.

Finally, in a roundabout way, the issue was raised that perhaps we should
change the project's name.  Twisted Python is mimsleading; it's not a
distribution of python, it's a collection of things written *in* python
(the convention is that other projects -- Stackless Python, Active
Python, Mac Python, Jython -- are actually interpreters).

Rather than attempmting to elevate the status of the somewhat dubious
'ouroboros' module, it might be better just to call the full distribution
TwistedMatrix-0.9.0 on the next release, with individual modules
eventually being released separately
(TwistedWeb/TwistedReality/TwistedPB).

Any thoughts on the name change issue?

You're going to want to run

twistd will also start an experimental web server interface on port 8080,

either change our release schedule for 0.9.0, or release a 0.8.10?

I vote yes, so I don't spin my wheels getting too involved in code that's been rewritten.

Message-ID: <20010630024125.A29375@Fookidla.org>

I've implemented a web todo list, as you may have seen in CVS, and have
an instance running at http://twistedmatrix.com/~carmstro/todo (or
http://twistedmatrix.com/users/carmstro.twistd/todo), and I'd like us to 
start using it for the project. Anyone who wants a username/password,
drop me a note.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] explorer.py
Message-ID: <20010630025952.B29375@Fookidla.org>

I'm working on a generic namespace browser. I've just committed a prototype
to TwistedPython/twisted/explorer.py (after much fretting of glyph and I over
what it should be named), and would like some suggestions. I'm
going to be taking a look at Squeak's browser again to get some ideas, but I'm
not a veteran squeak hacker, so I probably won't grok it as much as some other
people *cough*dash*cough* ;-)

Anyway, the gist of it is that I want a generic ObjectBrowser that can call
methods of, get attributes of, and execute arbitrary code in arbitrary
namespaces. Eventually a reality, web, and 3d UI are planned, and I think
there is a very interesting possibility of using it for the configuration
interface.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] What you thought would always last has passed you by...
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0106302021320.15953-100000@zaibach.twistedmatrix.com>

Apologies for the dearth of information on the mailing list and releases
lately.  I've been working on a new job, visiting my family, and some
other things.  However, I have been pouring quite a bit of effort into
Twisted Python as well.  The most exciting new development is Perspective
Broker, the erstwhile replacement for Gloop; I'm currently starting to
remove the old gloop-protocols in .web and .reality and replace them with
the newer, more robust perspective protocol.  Perspective Broker is more
than just a more robust Gloop, though; it's a culmination of all my
thinking about XML-RPC, CORBA, PyRO, and RMI.  The first application that
uses it to its full potential won't be available for a while, but trust
me, it'll be cool :-) 

Chris Armstrong has been doing a first-class job taking care of some
structural refactorings that needed to be done to make twisted.web and
twisted.reality worthwhile; although this doesn't meet our stated release
goals for 0.9.0, I really think that this release is worthy of a major
version bump.

Finally, in a roundabout way, the issue was raised that perhaps we should
change the project's name.  Twisted Python is mimsleading; it's not a
distribution of python, it's a collection of things written *in* python
(the convention is that other projects -- Stackless Python, Active
Python, Mac Python, Jython -- are actually interpreters).

Rather than attempmting to elevate the status of the somewhat dubious
'ouroboros' module, it might be better just to call the full distribution
TwistedMatrix-0.9.0 on the next release, with individual modules
eventually being released separately
(TwistedWeb/TwistedReality/TwistedPB).

Any thoughts on the name change issue?
