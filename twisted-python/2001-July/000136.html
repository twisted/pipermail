<PRE>DARKNESS AT THE END OF TIME (AP): The increasingly infamous &quot;Twisted&quot;
internet infrastructure suite from Twisted Matrix Laboratories got another
revision today, at version 0.9.1.  During a routine rearranging of the
web-site in preparation for the release, the software's much touted
&quot;ability to destroy the sun&quot; was accidentally triggered, causing the star
at the center of our solar system to implode violently and extinguish
itself.  Prepared for just such an eventuality, Chris Armstrong -- a
spokesperson for Twisted Matrix -- announced that the &quot;enterprise edition&quot;
of Twisted-0.9.2 will &quot;come packaged with three free `ability to restore
the sun' support incidents, for the modest price of 3 quintillion standard
galactic credits&quot;.

While many were quick to cast the solar vandals in a poor light, a
little-known, but influential, political group, the &quot;Pittsburgh Society of
Underwriters&quot;, promptly made a public statement in Twisted's defense; that
&quot;far graver threats to freedom and whitespace exist than those within our
small planetary orbit&quot;.  A spokesperson for the group, identified only as
&quot;Tim&quot;  said at a press conference (in a twangy, metallic voice), &quot;Space
holds a terrible power&quot;.

Chief Reality Engineer Allen Short could not be reached for comment, but
sources close to the Matrix claim he was off-planet, visiting Hornclausica
IV, the enigmatic homeworld of Prolog programmers.

----

This release contains a few bugfixes for twisted.spread, a more stable
spreadable webserver, an actually functional IRC server.  Additionally the
tm.com website has been reorganized slightly (finally pythonic.org has a
different frontpage... ^_^).

I'd like to ask that anybody looking for something fun to do with twisted
start trying to break pb, especially its security.  I'm curious how it
will hold up to a real focused onslaught.

Until next time...
