The biggest problem with Evolution (or anything) is that it's not Twisted 
enough. One small part of the philosophy behind Twisted is reinventing the 
wheel, but to be a rocket-powered wheel (look at all the UNIX services we're
reimplementing).

If you want to make a new type of information, make a new subclass of the
base InfoData class. You can also make a new organizer class for it, and 
a new UI. The &quot;integration&quot; he's talking of isn't at the UI level, it's at
the base. In other words, our integration isn't the same integration that
Desktop Environments are going after -- Look&amp;Feel integration. We're going for
data that will be integrated. The associator will be able to associate 
arbitrary InfoDatas to each other.

&gt;<i> use of your contact list and schedule things into your calendar -- even

</I>
Sure, as long as there is a PB implementation in that language (on a side note,
dash seems to be getting along with a Lisp implementation of glen. After glen,
there will probably be a PB implementation for Lisp, too). Of course,
accessing the data without going through PB will be harder, but that wouldn't
be Twisted.

&gt;<i> Now, we all know that since PB is being published under the Twisted

</I>
PB has nothing to do with the integration of the PIM. The big integrator
is the imaginary 'associator' module in the PIM package. PB will just serve
as the protocol for remote access to the PIM information, and by remote I
don't just mean connecting to remote hosts - there will be a PIM service running
on your local twisted process, and you connect to that with the PIM clients.
