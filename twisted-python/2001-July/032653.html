<PRE>I really do not like that we call our &quot;servers&quot; &quot;Ports&quot;. I think a much
better term would be &quot;Listener&quot;. I've talked to glyph before about this,
and he's  usually been too busy to discuss it with me (at least, that's what
*he* says...), so here it is on the list. What's wrong with using &quot;Listener&quot;?

A lot of people get confused by the term &quot;Port&quot;. When they think &quot;Port&quot;,
they don't necessarily think of &quot;something that sits on a port, and listens
for incoming connections&quot;. That's just how I understand it. Another argument
against Port is that it's not only for &quot;waiting for incoming connections&quot; --
clients also allocate ports when they connect to remote hosts. So, even
technically, Port is an inaccurate term for this class. You might find other
technical details that make &quot;Listener&quot; slightly inaccurate, but it still
just Makes Sense to most people (I'm guessing -- DavidC_, after me using
the word &quot;Port&quot;, and explaining that I'd rather prefer &quot;listener&quot;, told
me he would've immediately understood what I was talking about if I had
used that term from the beginning).

So, it should just be known that I am vehemently against using &quot;Port&quot; for
this class. If you can come up with something better than Listener (and
that also *makes sense* without having it explained to me first), then
that's great.
