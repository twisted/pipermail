Well, except that we're not integrating spreadsheets into documents, we're
integrating personal information. (see below)

The associator module will probably be pretty easy to implement. It's just
that Nafai nor I have gotten around to it yet. ;) I put up some preliminary
babblings on the associator on the Wiki page for TwistedPim.

I also think you don't quite understand what we're trying to do here - We're
not trying to integrate &quot;everything under the sun&quot;, we're just making it so
the PIM Data we have is highly interconnected. The PIM idea came before the
Associator idea, and it just fits really well. The associator isn't meant to
be the end-all be-all, Twisted is. ;-)

On a side note, we really have to stop using the term &quot;associator module&quot; ;)
The association code will be in the InfoData class itself, and there will
probably be another module that just keeps track of lists of all the different
kinds of InfoData. Not sure what this should be called -- anyway, go read
TwistedPim, I'm babbling =)
