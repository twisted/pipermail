<PRE>well, since you asked...
&quot;Listener&quot; is very passive, non-directed.  It would be nice if we could
convey the idea of something dedicated/allocated wishing/waiting/hoping
for a _potential connection.  It's not &quot;someone who happens to be
listening&quot; to a broadcast, it's more like &quot;operators are standing by.&quot;

Of course, the word &quot;operator&quot; is plainly no good, as it's a loaded term
in this environment.  A close synonym is &quot;receptionist&quot;, but that's a
bit unwieldy and doesn't feel quite right to me.  &quot;clerk&quot; is too
general, &quot;teller&quot; (as in bank) doesn't work either.

I'm not sure &quot;port&quot; is really that bad.  It's a point of contact,
something with a *specific address* which may be connected to (which
&quot;Listener&quot; does /not/ convey), something that things traveling
to/from remote locations go through.  And hell, if you're going to use a
phrase like &quot;TCP&quot;, you might as well use the standard terminology that
goes with it.  =)

You're right though, in saying that not all ports are for inbound
connections, they're also for outbound connections.  Maybe a qualifier
is in order?

ok I think I better stop there
