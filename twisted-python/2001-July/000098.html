<PRE>* The TwistedPython Weekly News *

1st Issue. Monday, July 2, 2001

QOTW:

  --&gt; java (<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">dutkiewicz at 91.portland-01-02rs.or.dial-access.att.net</A>) has joined
  #python
  &lt;java&gt; yes
  &lt;-- java (<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">dutkiewicz at 91.portland-01-02rs.or.dial-access.att.net</A>) has left
  #python
  &lt;glyph&gt; goodbye, java
  &lt;glyph&gt; hehe, that's surprisingly satisfying to say


Welcome to the TwistedPython Weekly News. This is the first issue, so it will
cover a larger time-frame than a single week. If we find that we do not have
enough news for an issue every week, we may change it to the TwistedPython
Monthly News.

* Progress *

After a period of low activity, there were a lot of new changes in the Twisted
code base. Here are some summaries.

* Refactorings: Chris Armstrong did a lot of work refactoring both twisted.web
  and twisted.reality. The web refactoring was finished on 2001-06-11 and
  twisted.reality on 2001-06-20. During these refactorings, a change to the
  Coding Standard was required, as Chris found that Python has limitations on
  circular imports in packages. Sibling imports were allowed in this case
  (&quot;import html&quot; instead of &quot;from twisted.web import html&quot;).
* Twisted Explorer: Chris started doing an interactive Object Browser that he
  eventually wants to write a Reality front-end to, and has been heard rambling
  about a potential 3d interface.
* Other stuff: There have been other minor hacks lately: Chris started
  rewriting calendar.py, the web calendar, and started the twisted.pim package
  with the 'todo' module. There is a web-based front-end for todo, and an
  instance of it is running here. There have also been a few additions to net
  and authenticator.
* Name Change: There has been talk of a name change. The name &quot;Twisted Python&quot;
  is definitely going, as it can mislead people to believe that it's some sort
  of distribution of Python (Most Python ports/distributions are &quot;Something
  Python&quot;). Two ideas so far are just &quot;Twisted&quot; or &quot;TwistedMatrix&quot;.


* Short-term Todo *

Watch out for some cool new things coming to TwistedPython.

* Chris is working on a spell-casting system for Twisted Reality.
* Jason Asbahr will be working on InstanceMessenger, a new messaging system
  based on the new PerspectiveBroker.
* Watch out for twisted.pim. Glyph is getting an Agenda VR3 soon and he wants
  Twisted Python running on it. :)


* Interesting Thing Of the Week:
* The Twisted PerspectiveBroker

After much mucking about, Glyph finally refactored ProxyBroker into
PerspectiveBroker. This is probably the most exciting new development for
Twisted Python in recent time. pb is a replacement for Gloop, which mainly uses
cPickle for serialization of objects. pb, on the other hand, uses 'jelly', a
home-made serialization library which uses S-Expressions. This is going to be a
very central part of TPy, and we're all very excited about it. Go Glyph!

Ok, that's it for this week. Thanks for reading!
Chris Armstrong
