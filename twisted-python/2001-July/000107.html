Oh, as I said, I have no doubt that there are problems, from biggest to
littlest.  I was merely suggesting the possibility that they might have
got something *right* too -- and if so, that's good information to have
when you're setting out to achieve something with many of the same
goals.  I don't think it hurts to know what the wheel looks like before
you reinvent it.

&gt;<i> &gt; Now, forget I said that phase, because it doesn't mean much. ;) I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just raise a few more questions:  What if the resource you are

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you incorporate resources into this system that you, the Twisted.pim

</I>
This is why I told you to forget I said the &quot;d. e.&quot; phrase =)
I think you underestimate miguel's ambition -- Twisted folks aren't the
only ones trying to take over the world. ;)   Having a cohesive
environment does not just mean that the dialog boxes all look similar
and the context-sensitive pop-ups feel the same, you also need to be
able to incorporate the product of one application into another -- e.g.
your plotter into your spreadsheet, your spreadsheet into your marketing
document, your documents into your conferences and presentations.  You
have not convinced me that this is different from your &quot;data
integration&quot;.

[ Feel free to understand a &quot;How little Acap understands things&quot; flame
too ;) ]

&gt;<i> &gt; Now, we all know that since PB is being published under the Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; label, it's got to be the greatest thing since spreadable cheese.  But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even so, but I'd sleep better at night if I read a memo comparing its

(The following is me paraphrasing radix, not quite his original words:)
} PB has nothing to do with integration between the PIM components.
} That will be done by our /imaginary/ [emphasis mine ;) ] 'associator'
} module.  PB will just serve as the portocol for [remote] access to the
} information.

See issue my #2 in my other post from today,
