This is also my experience. When fixing issue 4378, I received mostly 
constructive feedback. 

There is much knowledge how to &quot;do things&quot; when working on the codebase, 
some of it implicit or spread over multiple documents. During review, 
this knowledge was conveyed in a tangible way, using a concrete piece of 
code.

I have to admit that it was a little discouraging to receive a long list 
of change requests. But the reviewers did a very good job explaining why 
things should be changed. This helped me to adapt my patches to fulfill 
the standards for the codebase. And it was very satisfying to finally 
have the patch accepted :-).

Best regards,
