At least personally, moving away from SVN and Trac is not to directly
get more patches. It's mainly that I want as a contributor to use better
tools. Also, I don't want us to maintain the infrastructure; for
example, moving to a more recent Trac cost me personally a good amount
of time; we also have that problem with spam.

</I>
Well, that logic is a bit flawed though: you're kind of saying that we
shouldn't use a better tool because it may bring us more contributors
than we can handle. At the end of the day, we would still use a better
tool though.
