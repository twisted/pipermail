Why it is a nightmare? Just do svn checkout of &quot;the ticket branch&quot; and
continue your work and submit additional patches against it if needed.
The only problem here that I could see is if you have made some changes in
addition to your patch. But in this case kdiff3 makes it a snap to merge you
changes to the ticket branch checkout.


&gt;<i> My Git copy being tied to an older SVN rev that my patch is based on. SVN

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I can't decipher this, could you elaborate?


&gt;<i> DVCS would allow me to branch, commit to my repo, and then let JP pull from

</I>
IMHO the common practice is to accept patches for review and potential
inclusion and pull only from a trusted &quot;lieutenants&quot; (like in Linux kernel
case) and creating patches is not very different in svn, git etc.
