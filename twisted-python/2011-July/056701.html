&gt;<i>  * Does Github's ticketing system have the kind of integration with Git
</I>&gt;<i>    that Twisted has built for Trac+SVN?  Bitbucket has some similar stuff,
</I>&gt;<i>    so I would be surprised if Github didn't, but I just don't know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Stuff like refs/closes interacts with the ticketing system yes. You can have
as many hooks as you like for topfiles.


&gt;<i>  * Git is annoying.  It's a pretty horrible piece of software in my
</I>&gt;<i>    opinion, and made some bad design decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
magit makes it a lot more pleasant if you use emacs, by the way.


&gt;<i>  * Git essentially makes Windows a second-class environment (as did
</I>&gt;<i>    Combinator).  We already have trouble recruiting Windows people, and
</I>&gt;<i>    IMO one of Twisted's strengths is that you can usually run things on
</I>&gt;<i>    Linux/MacOSX/Windows with very few cahnges, if any.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I've been told this has *vastly* improved, but I don't know for sure since
I'm not a Windows user.


&gt;<i>  * For me, Bitbucket has always been pretty comparable to Github.  I know
</I>&gt;<i>    others will disagree, and point out all kinds of features that Github
</I>&gt;<i>    has over Bitbucket, but apparently I never use those features.  Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i>    those features (whatever they are) are more important in projects
</I>&gt;<i>    of Twisted's size and/or history.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, many features are comparable, the main feature differences are polish,
but the killer difference is community size.


&gt;<i>  * I have been told, but not actually experienced, that using the hg-git
</I>&gt;<i>    plugin for Mercurial makes using Git for your repository into &quot;an
</I>&gt;<i>    implementation detail&quot;, and the user basicaly doesn't even really
</I>&gt;<i>    have to care that they aren't using Hg.  If true, this would make me
</I>&gt;<i>    pretty happy...but I'm not entirely sure that it _is_ true.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Although I've never tried this, I've been assured this is the case.


&gt;<i>  * it is unclear how Github would work with UQDS with regards to having a
</I>&gt;<i>    ticket for all new work.  IMO this is even more important than code
</I>&gt;<i>    reviews.  Would we just say: no pull requests will be accepted unless
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Your question got cut off. I think you wanted to say &quot;there's a ticket for
that&quot;?


&gt;<i>   * How would running buildbot over a git/bzr/hg branch work?  Would
</I>&gt;<i> Github's
</I>&gt;<i>    hooks be able to drive this?  Would we be able to tell buildbot to &quot;go
</I>&gt;<i>    run tests on this branch&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Although I've never tried this, I've been assured this is the case.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Assuming a change like this would take place, what would the plan be
</I>&gt;<i>    for transition?  Would all the branches that are out there be
</I>&gt;<i>    migrate-able?  What about all the Trac tickets, wiki, etc?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The first thing I thought right after I thought &quot;we're going to need a trac
to markdown converter&quot; is &quot;khorn is going to jump off a cliff next&quot; ;-)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * How does this affect the Sphinx transition plan? (I don't really know
</I>&gt;<i>    that it would affect it at all...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't see how it would.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Since Twisted's current web presence _is_ a Trac site, who's going to
</I>&gt;<i>    step up and build a new website?  Github/Bitbucket/Launchpad is _NOT_
</I>&gt;<i>    a replacement for an actual &quot;marketing&quot; or &quot;home page&quot; type site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Absolutely not. I am *not* advocating replacing this site, simply having
</I>something similar that isn't trac and isn't involved in the site
development. If anything, this separates the concerns of &quot;home page style
site&quot; and development site even clearer, IMO.


&gt;<i> Overall, this is probably a good plan, but it's going to bea harder and
</I>&gt;<i> take
</I>&gt;<i> more work than people think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I agree with Itamar's comments that while switching to a DVCS might
</I>&gt;<i> ameliorate Twisted's social/organizational issues somewhat, but is unlikely
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> to wholly fix them. That stuff needs to be discussed and worked on as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There's no silver bullet. Not making new potential contributors bend over,
and having all contributions trivially easy to put in version control,
regardless of their contributor status, sounds like a good start.
