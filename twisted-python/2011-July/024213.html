I absolutely agree with Phil here.
The twisted code and contribution standards are so high that patches 
from new contributors (like myself) are bound to be rejected/resubmitted 
at least once, maybe more. Don't get me wrong, I believe high standards 
are a good thing, but doing continuous development based on tools like 
svn and trac is really painful and it's really difficult to motivate 
yourself to work on a once rejected ticket.

That being said, I believe that the move to a DVCS is a smart move for 
any project looking for continuous community contribution, because IMHO 
they simply allow for a more developer friendly process for all 
involved, thus making the whole review process a more friendly and less 
discouraging thing.

Cheers,
Chris
