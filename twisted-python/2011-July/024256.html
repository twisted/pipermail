Why not? I know the reasons three years ago (and most of them were either
permissions or performance), but I have been assured multiple times that
this is no longer the case at all.


&gt;<i> Also python has moved to mercurial and bitbucket catched up in features to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Because the community on Github is significantly larger.

At some point, this devolves into bikeshedding. Twisted devs would prefer
Launchpad, but many people hate Launchpad with a passion. Between Github and
Bitbucket, as you've said yourself, Bitbucket is playing feature catch-up
(whether they're doing that successfully or not is something I'm willing to
skip discussing). I don't think features are the thing to differentiate the
two on (even though I think Github wins because of polish). It's network
effects. Github has more following, so it's more interesting.

The thing is, it's not so much a vote. This is a do-ocracy. The breaks were
&quot;I'll move it to Github, *or* someone stops me&quot;, not &quot;I'll move it to
Github, or Bitbucket, or whatever else you folks think is a good idea&quot;. If
people are going to try and stop me from moving it to Github, I'm not going
to move it to Bitbucket or anything else. It's just going to stay Trac/SVN.

Regards,
