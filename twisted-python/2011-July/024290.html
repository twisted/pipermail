Looking at <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3420">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3420</A> now, I see reviews with lots of functional issues and spec-compliance/correctness issues raised.  There are a few notes on the API as well, but without addressing the reviews there, the patch would just have incorrect behavior.  The few notes that are purely API aesthetics are mostly &quot;make this private by default&quot;, which should be a trivial search-and-replace to fix.

</I>

That does sound a little like &quot;the perfect API&quot; to me :).  And, I'd be inclined to argue - if I could find even one example of a functionally-correct patch with sufficient docs and tests that had actually been held up because of API issues :).
