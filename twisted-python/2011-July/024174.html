&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As some of you may already know (either through a backchannel or because you
</I>&gt;<i> talked to me at Europython), there has been some talk about moving Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> way from Trac+SVN to somewhere that isn't Trac+SVN.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of the devs do like SVN. My guess is that that's mainly because they
</I>&gt;<i> don't actually use SVN, they use Combinator, or something. On the other
</I>&gt;<i> hand, I do think that Trac is pretty universally loathed, and it would be a
</I>&gt;<i> good idea to get away from it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's a few existing hosting solutions:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Launchpad (+ Bazaar as the default vcs)
</I>&gt;<i>    2. Bitbucket (+ Mercurial as the default vcs)
</I>&gt;<i>    3. Github (+ Git as the default vcs)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Although I've hated git for a long while (and I still don't like it very
</I>&gt;<i> much), I firmly believe Github is the right thing for Twisted. My incredibly
</I>&gt;<i> unscientific poll amongst people who like Twisted but aren't devs is that
</I>&gt;<i> they all love or at least like Github, and a surprising number has a
</I>&gt;<i> distaste for Launchpad (unfamiliarity with Bazaar, perceived
</I>&gt;<i> developer-unfriendly UI, slowness).
</I>
Hi Laurens,

Thanks for pushing this. Personally, I would prefer Launchpad and Bzr,
but we've been thinking about using it for the past 3 years, and nothing
really happened. What I really care about is that we move away from Trac
(for bugs at least) and SVN.

As I told you in Florence, if you come with a nice migration plan *and*
you're ready to take on the burden, that's awesome and you have all my
support for moving to Github. But, if somebody else is ready to do the
same thing for Launchpad, I'll support him first. It seems unlikely though.
