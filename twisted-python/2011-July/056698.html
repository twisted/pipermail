&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> As some of you may already know (either through a backchannel or because
</I>&gt;<i> you talked to me at Europython), there has been some talk about moving
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted way from Trac+SVN to somewhere that isn't Trac+SVN.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of the devs do like SVN. My guess is that that's mainly because they

</I>&gt;<i> hand, I do think that Trac is pretty universally loathed, and it would be a
</I>&gt;<i> good idea to get away from it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's a few existing hosting solutions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Launchpad (+ Bazaar as the default vcs)
</I>&gt;<i>    2. Bitbucket (+ Mercurial as the default vcs)
</I>&gt;<i>    3. Github (+ Git as the default vcs)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although I've hated git for a long while (and I still don't like it very
</I>&gt;<i> much), I firmly believe Github is the right thing for Twisted. My incredibly
</I>&gt;<i> unscientific poll amongst people who like Twisted but aren't devs is that
</I>&gt;<i> they all love or at least like Github, and a surprising number has a
</I>&gt;<i> distaste for Launchpad (unfamiliarity with Bazaar, perceived
</I>&gt;<i> developer-unfriendly UI, slowness).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unless someone is going to go all &quot;NO GITHUB IS TERRIBLE AND YOU ARE A BAD
</I>&gt;<i> PERSON FOR EVEN SUGGESTING IT&quot; on me, maybe we can talk about planning the

</I>A bunch of thoughts after reading a lot of this thread:

 * any move to  any DVCS will need a well-defined
   workflow/branching model/whatever, and it needs to be _written down_ so
   that people can be referred to it

 * moving to a DVCS would make it easier to merge changes from contributors

 * moving to a DVCS would allow contributors to work on their contributions
   in version control...no more patch nonsense.

 * though at times, after dealing with SVN/Combinator, I have longed for the

   patch nonsense...

 * A move to _any_ DVCS would almost certainly be a win over SVN.  I've
   had to go back to using SVN at work for my day-to-day, and it is
   _painful_.

 * I've never had any huge problesm with Trac, though I can see that
   offloading admin responsibilities is a good thing.

 * Does Github's ticketing system have the kind of integration with Git
   that Twisted has built for Trac+SVN?  Bitbucket has some similar stuff,
   so I would be surprised if Github didn't, but I just don't know.

 * I've never liked Launchpad.  I find it confusing and hard to navigate.

 * Git is annoying.  It's a pretty horrible piece of software in my
   opinion, and made some bad design decisions.

 * Git essentially makes Windows a second-class environment (as did
   Combinator).  We already have trouble recruiting Windows people, and
   IMO one of Twisted's strengths is that you can usually run things on
   Linux/MacOSX/Windows with very few cahnges, if any.

 * Github almost makes up for Git's irritating-ness.

 * Github's extra features have never yet caused me to choose Git as a new
   project over Mercurial.

 * For me, Bitbucket has always been pretty comparable to Github.  I know
   others will disagree, and point out all kinds of features that Github
   has over Bitbucket, but apparently I never use those features.  Perhaps
   those features (whatever they are) are more important in projects
   of Twisted's size and/or history.

 * I have been told, but not actually experienced, that using the hg-git
   plugin for Mercurial makes using Git for your repository into &quot;an
   implementation detail&quot;, and the user basicaly doesn't even really
   have to care that they aren't using Hg.  If true, this would make me
   pretty happy...but I'm not entirely sure that it _is_ true.

 * it is unclear how Github would work with UQDS with regards to having a
   ticket for all new work.  IMO this is even more important than code
   reviews.  Would we just say: no pull requests will be accepted unless

 * How would running buildbot over a git/bzr/hg branch work?  Would Github's

   hooks be able to drive this?  Would we be able to tell buildbot to &quot;go
   run tests on this branch&quot;?

 * Assuming a change like this would take place, what would the plan be
   for transition?  Would all the branches that are out there be
   migrate-able?  What about all the Trac tickets, wiki, etc?

 * How does this affect the Sphinx transition plan? (I don't really know
   that it would affect it at all...).

 * Since Twisted's current web presence _is_ a Trac site, who's going to
   step up and build a new website?  Github/Bitbucket/Launchpad is _NOT_
   a replacement for an actual &quot;marketing&quot; or &quot;home page&quot; type site.

Overall, this is probably a good plan, but it's going to bea harder and take

more work than people think.

Also, I agree with Itamar's comments that while switching to a DVCS might
ameliorate Twisted's social/organizational issues somewhat, but is unlikely
to wholly fix them. That stuff needs to be discussed and worked on as well.
