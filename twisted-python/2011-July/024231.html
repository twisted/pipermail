I made it through the first several hurdles (working code, following 
coding standards, unit tests for everything) but then hit a legitimate 
reverse compatibility concern that kept my patches from landing. 
Someone eventually came up with a good solution, but the time gap meant 
that other things had changed and/or were about to change in Twisted, 
and gave more people a chance to bikeshed, which gave me less confidence 
that whatever I eventually finished would land.  So I punted and waited 
for someone with more political clout to take over.

Working with patches because you don't have svn commit rights is 
annoying, but this annoyance is a relatively minor fixed cost.  The real 
issue, for controversial features, is achieving consensus, and then 
getting your feature in before consensus is lost.
