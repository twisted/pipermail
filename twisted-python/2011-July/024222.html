</I>For me the pain isn't Trac, it's SVN.  The more I use DVCS's the more I hate
it.

Also, Combinator does not work on Windows, and hasn't for years.  And before
you say &quot;submit patches&quot;, I did.  They sat in the Divmod Trac instance for
over a year, I requested reviews of the relevant tickets _daily_ for 3
months on Divmod's IRC channel, and they were never merged, or even
reviewed, or even AFAIK put under version control.  Now they're gone with
the DIvmod site.

If the tickets are ever recoverable, they were tickets #3001-#3004.


&gt;<i> Plus, you can use the DVCS of your choice to actually author the patch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In theory, yes, though it is not obvious how to do this in a way that is
compatible with Twisted's workflow and Combinator.

See <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/BazaarMirror">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/BazaarMirror</A> for examples of some of
the caveats of using DVCS on top of Subversion.

Granted this works for just authoring a patch, which you then submit through
Trac or whatever, but that doesn't really buy you a lot, IMO (though it does
buy you something).
