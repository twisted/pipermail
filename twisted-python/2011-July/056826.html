Fair point; upon reflection of all the previous ad-hoc non-reentrancy stuff I've seen in the reactor, I retract my suggestion.  For testing, it's easy enough to plug a Clock() in there and iterate it once.

</I>
What would be the point of adding another task queue to the reactor?  This sounds like a solution to a non-problem.  (Although I might have suggested the same thing myself if I hadn't thought about it too much first.)

The answer that comes to mind when I think about this question is that an end-of-iteration queue would avoid unnecessary additional invocations of whatever multiplexing system call the reactor needs to make.  But there are several points on the down side:

it's more code to maintain
it's more interfaces for users, or at least maintainers, to learn
it's an optimization, and so we should produce a benchmark indicating that the optimization makes sense and is effective before doing it
the optimization could be applied to callLater as it stands; any callLater(0) calls could be executed before the next reactor tick

Mostly though, an additional queue for non-reentrancy would be an ad-hoc special-case solution to one tiny part of the more general problem that reactor event ordering is a complete accident with unforseen consequences.  If there were a more general scheduling mechanism, we could schedule events in a better order overall.
