We definitely want this to get in, this was a large part of the
motivation for Agent in the first place.

</I>
The goal is not so much a perfect API as something we won't have to
deprecate soon after because we realize there are some requirements that
can't be addressed in a backwards compatible way. In this case, the
cookie, proxy and other agent wrappers that have been created mean we
now have a better understanding of what the Agent API looks like from a
higher level, which should help.
