I have this same general feeling, but pretty much all of the reviews I found when I went looking for specific examples included at least some significant coding-standard, documentation, and test coverage problems.  If we can find more specific examples, perhaps we can prevent this from recurring.

twisted.web.client.Agent.

Maybe Twisted would benefit more from having that functionality in place,
than having the super-perfect API between Agent and HTTP parser.

&gt;<i> I do agree that we don't want to block every ticket on the absolute best possible implementation; but, allowing changes that don't have test and documentation coverage is a recipe for creating an unmaintainable mess.
</I>I agree.
