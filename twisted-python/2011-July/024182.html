<PRE>Hi,

</I>
True, GitHub is proprietary, but it's free for open source projects. There
are many high-quality open-source projects hosted on it:

 * Erlang/OTP (<A HREF="https://github.com/erlang/otp">https://github.com/erlang/otp</A>)
 * Redis (<A HREF="https://github.com/antirez/redis">https://github.com/antirez/redis</A>)
 * Jquery (<A HREF="https://github.com/jquery">https://github.com/jquery</A>)
 * RabbitMQ (<A HREF="https://github.com/rabbitmq">https://github.com/rabbitmq</A>)
 * Ruby on Rails (<A HREF="https://github.com/rails">https://github.com/rails</A>)
 * Node.js (<A HREF="https://github.com/joyent/node">https://github.com/joyent/node</A>)
 * Tornado (<A HREF="https://github.com/facebook/tornado">https://github.com/facebook/tornado</A>)

to name a few. GitHub also has an extensive API to programmatically
access/backup all information around your project (like tickets and wikis),
and it has integrated code review which allows you to comment on individual
lines of code (this could be better, but generally works well).

I suppose the main reason to even suggest it, given its proprietary nature
and use of git, is that's currently where a lot of developer activity is,
and its growing. GitHub makes it easy to contribute patches to projects and
keep track of progress. It also has a nice way to keep track of related
repositories (via 'organizations').

And, well, it looks better than Launchpad and is bit more mature than
Bitbucket.

Given the past involvement in Launchpad and its use of Twisted though, I
understand why that would be an obvious choice. I just want to make sure all
sides of the argument are represented.

In my opinion the biggest barrier to new developers is not whether we
&gt;<i> use git or subversion or what have you, but the high quality of code
</I>&gt;<i> required (coding standard, tests, passing code review). A DVCS may well
</I>&gt;<i> encourage more users, but I'm skeptical it will have a major impact.
</I>

I think you're right in that code quality is the most important factor here.
However, as a small point, a DVCS surely should be able give the project a
better ability to maintain high quality code though - isn't Combinator just
tool over subversion to make branching easier? At least with most DVCS's
branching is cheap, so there wouldn't need to be yet another tool to setup
to get the development process started for new developers.
