I agree that there is a problem getting patches reviewed, I think git
provides a much better tool to reduce the effort and pain for a
reviewer in applying patches, and updating branches to HEAD. Github's
patch review tool, and the ability to get a diff to a patch reviewed
are big wins in my opinion.

I think github means less effort for the reviewer because they can
review commits, rather than a large diff. They can review changes
following a review. They can have a tool to make comments next to the
code and it is less effort to apply patches and update branches to
HEAD.

Small, documentation diffs, for instance can be reduced to a single
click for a core developer to merge the change to trunk.
