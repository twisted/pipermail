Can you be more specific, please?  What's painful?

Procedurally, it's almost the same number of clicks (except for the unfortunate need to type the word 'review') to do this on Github or Launchpad.  What part of the process is painful?  If you're not a committer, we're not going to let you run code on our buildbots either way without a cursory review (that's just a recipe for automated attacks) so it's not like you get past that step for free, either.

Plus, you can use the DVCS of your choice to actually author the patch.
