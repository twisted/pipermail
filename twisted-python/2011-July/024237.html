I update the tarball a few times a year at <A HREF="http://ludios.net/mirror/">http://ludios.net/mirror/</A> -
see Twisted-checkout-README.txt for notes.

If you do it yourself, keep in mind that git svn clone has to restart
at r1 several times, for reasons I don't fully understand (due to
partial SVN branches?).  A few months back, a branch created by bzr
with an svn:mergeinfo property caused it to restart at r1 again.  This
adds about 27 hours to the git svn clone time, unfortunately.
