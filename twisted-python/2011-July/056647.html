<PRE>Hi,


As some of you may already know (either through a backchannel or because you
talked to me at Europython), there has been some talk about moving Twisted
way from Trac+SVN to somewhere that isn't Trac+SVN.

A lot of the devs do like SVN. My guess is that that's mainly because they
don't actually use SVN, they use Combinator, or something. On the other
hand, I do think that Trac is pretty universally loathed, and it would be a
good idea to get away from it.

There's a few existing hosting solutions:

   1. Launchpad (+ Bazaar as the default vcs)
   2. Bitbucket (+ Mercurial as the default vcs)
   3. Github (+ Git as the default vcs)

Although I've hated git for a long while (and I still don't like it very
much), I firmly believe Github is the right thing for Twisted. My incredibly
unscientific poll amongst people who like Twisted but aren't devs is that
they all love or at least like Github, and a surprising number has a
distaste for Launchpad (unfamiliarity with Bazaar, perceived
developer-unfriendly UI, slowness).

Unless someone is going to go all &quot;NO GITHUB IS TERRIBLE AND YOU ARE A BAD
PERSON FOR EVEN SUGGESTING IT&quot; on me, maybe we can talk about planning the
transition? :)

cheers
