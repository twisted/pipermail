</I>&gt;<i> Ok I have linked to my branch in <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4799">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4799</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does that look right? is the next step to put &quot;review&quot; into 4799's keywords field?
</I>
The next step is actually to make a backported patch specifically for &lt;<A HREF="http://tm.tl/4799">http://tm.tl/4799</A>&gt;, and get that merged into a release branch.  The idea with the release ticket is that it's for the release notes and final QA; all the actual code should be complete in individual feature tickets first.

I'm sorry - now I'm noticing that the workflow on the linked tickets (for example &lt;<A HREF="http://tm.tl/4786">http://tm.tl/4786</A>&gt;) is actually wrong for a maintenance release, as there's no cloned bug to indicate the backport.  If I recall correctly, /branches/releases/release-10.2.0-4651-2 is the branch to merge things into for a 10.2.x maintenance release.

At this point it would probably be good to get on the mailing list &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python</A>&gt; and discuss these issues more publicly; someone else with more experience with the release toolchain can provide you more specific advice, and you'll get faster responses than from me personally.  I'm Cc:ing this message to that list so that there will be some context when the discussion starts.

I was going to recommend the IRC channel too, but I am told you've already been there; I hope I'll run into you there :).

&gt;<i> Also I don't know how to get the code changes out of launchpad and into your svn repository.
</I>
A committer will do that, based on your branch.  You may have to use our all-branches mirror to continue work, as Launchpad only mirrors trunk.  Or, you may become an committer; we normally ask that people fix a few smaller bugs first, but given that you're volunteering to manage a release we may expedite that process :).

&gt;<i> Diane
</I>
Once again I _really_ appreciate your time here.  As you can probably tell, we rarely have the contributor bandwidth to do maintenance releases and so we're somewhat rusty at it.  We like to provide a smooth upgrade process for our users though, so when we manage to get this pushed through it will be a big benefit to our XMPP users.

Thanks,
