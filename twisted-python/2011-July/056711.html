Because they don't always seem to track the ticket branch folders in a
timely manner. Especially, when JP (he seems to usually be my reviewer :) )
pushes a modification of my patch to the ticket branch. It's at this point
trying to merge in from SVN is usually a nightmare. My Git copy being tied
to an older SVN rev that my patch is based on. SVN just seems to lose it's
brains when my patch isn't in the SVN commit history, because SVN repo
doesn't allow me to commit in. DVCS would allow me to branch, commit to my
repo, and then let JP pull from my repo into his to review and push up to
the Twisted repo when he's happy with it...and all of the commit history is
sane from the original, to my patch to his changes, so when I go to pull
back down from the Twisted repo everything merges sanely.


&gt;<i> Or for that matter, you can include e.g. an github URL in the ticket
</I>&gt;<i> instead of attaching the patch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Honestly, the &quot;process&quot; documents are pretty clear you're supposed to attach
a patch so that's what I do...also even that wouldn't solve the issue
described above.
