I have submitted patches that went nowhere:

<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4602">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4602</A>
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4603">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4603</A>
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4610">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4610</A>
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4666">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4666</A>

Some of them seemed to be:

&quot;No, don't do it this way, do it that way&quot;. I'll be honest, that's just 
completely demoralising, when you're contributing new functionality.

On that topic, I don't think the Twisted process is as accessible as 
some of you guys think it is I'm afraid. I found the discussion about 
the IPv6 tickets a bit disheartening :o(


However, more constructively (less whiney!) some tickets languished in 
&quot;make these tiny cleanups&quot; and that's just incredibly painful in the 
current setup, with SVN and Trac mediating things.

I've got absolutely no interest in pulling SVN head, writing a patch, 
submitting it as an attachment via Trac and *then* being told &quot;ok, I've 
created this branch. Go off and learn how to do branches in a crappy old 
centralised VCS, and in a way compatible with UQDS, re-do your patch in 
a branch, then send another diff in as a file&quot;

Really? I mean, come on guys...

If it were git/github, then I'd simply make the incremental changes in 
my local git branch, re-push to github and re-submit the pull request.

I hate Launchpad, but I'm sure it's equivalent beats the crap out of SVN.

Please, for the love of god, adopt a DVCS which lets contributors 
develop continuously against a local branch and push changes!

Cheers,
Phil
