</I>I've had some patched rejected, probably on sound basis.  But the
experience always leave you with a feeling that you got stabbed.

Sometimes it _is_ be better to get some basic functionality in
place, instead of arguing about how things should be done &quot;the
right way&quot;.

 From time to time you find a ticket that you want fixed, and start
working on it, but end up never submitting it since you already
know that even if it fixes the problem it will be shot down, since
it doesn't do it this or that way.
