2 of those are mine. They're almost to the point of being accepted, but we're at that phase where there's a lot of roundtrips due to the code reviewing involved, and syncing SVN in that scenario is such a pain in the rear I've bogged down and gotten side tracked by other projects that have an easier system for contribution workflow ( Github or Bitbucket). I think you'd see the &quot;wither on the vine&quot; rate decline if Twisted moved to a system that made the workflow of contribution smoother. I like tools that make the work, rather than the tool, the focus of the job at hand...and that's definitely not SVN, Trac or LP. 

I'd advocate Git if only because it has the most number of integrations (that work well) with other VCSs, so devs can use the VCS/DVCS client they like best. 

I'd definitely vote for Github as well. The integration between the code, tickets and code review is by far the best I've worked with. 

Also, let's keep in mind the social aspect for visibility. When there's an interesting project, if it's on Github I'll hit the 'watch' button. This means I keep up-to-date on changes and activity for projects I want to use but may never contribute to. Github has opened my eyes to a number of projects that otherwise would have fallen off my radar...and I don't think that's an effect to dismiss lightly.
