I think there are 2 sides though here: we want to move away from Trac as
well as from SVN. And, the main reason for me is that we don't have to
maintain Trac. So redmine wouldn't solve the whole problem.

As Laurens said as well, the main attraction for git is using github. I
don't think switching to git alone makes a ton of sense.

One thing that concerns me is that Trac supposedly supports bzr, and we
tried to use bzr, but never made the move completely. Why do you think
it will change? Is it just that we didn't take any decisions? Or that
nobody stepped up?

</I>
Well, even not thinking about new developers, a DVCS will make the life
of current ones easier. Even though we can start to use bzr, it's a bit
clumsy IMHO.
