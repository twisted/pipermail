</I>
Actually, you might be interested in &lt;<A HREF="http://tm.tl/4854">http://tm.tl/4854</A>&gt;.  This will be in 11.1.  TLS _is_ a protocol-that-is-a-transport now (in trunk).  This was the case in 11.0, too, but only for the IOCP reactor.  We've been smoothing out some interesting quirks that occurred as a result, mostly test-related, but it's looking good for the release; more robust, actually, because it's easier to test the stacked version than to try to trick sockets into returning specific values in C.

&gt;<i> The thing with Consumers and Producers seems... very abstract. If I'm
</I>&gt;<i> sitting down to retrieve email via POP3 (to pick a random protocol),
</I>&gt;<i> 'transports' and 'protocols' are tools that nestle very comfortably in
</I>&gt;<i> my mental model of the task in front of me; &quot;consumers&quot; and &quot;producers&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> are not.
</I>
The APIs definitely aren't as nice, and that's where I predict the most discussion in the PEP.

&gt;<i> Are they concepts that should be handled by transport implementors?
</I>
Yes, pretty much always.

&gt;<i> Protocol implementors?
</I>
Yes, if you need them.

&gt;<i> Protocol users?
</I>
It depends.  Ideally you should be able to rely on the protocol providing a reasonable stream-friendly API.  (You probably only care about this if you're writing a proxy.)

&gt;<i> Should they be mapped onto XON/XOFF or RTS/CTS by serial transports?
</I>
Either or.  Probably an option to the serial transport.
