<PRE>Hi,

I am looking to build a system that runs multiple processes across a LAN 
of win32 machines. The processes will be initialised with a large amount 
of data at startup, followed by many more smaller chunks of data with the 
results being returned across the network. I would like to 
represent/transfer the data using your pb.Copyable and/or pb.Cacheable 
objects. My main question relates to the fact that pb uses jelly to 
serialise these objects. Particularly the comments at the top of the jelly 
module that emphasise the fact that jelly should have a lot more 
optimization in order to gain acceptable large-scale performance and that, 
compared to pickle, jelly is a more portable, human readable, less 
efficient mechanism.

So, would you use pb/jelly for transferring large chunks of data (e.g. 
~10s MB) to multiple nodes on a LAN?
If not, could pb be used with, for example, pickle instead of jelly?
Also, I notice that the pb, jelly and flavors modules are all classified 
as semi-stable. Could you give an indication of what this means in 
practice?

Thank you for your time. I think you have built a very useful/powerful 
framework and am looking forward to using it.

Regards,

Will Lewis
