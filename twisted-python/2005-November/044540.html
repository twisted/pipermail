</I>I assume you're referring to the fact that Twisted conch provides a
replacement for the manhole support in
base Twisted.  It's confusing conch claims to be:

&quot;...an SSHv2 implementation written in Python. SSH is a protocol
designed to allow remote access to shells and commands, but it is
generic enough to allow everything from TCP forwarding to generic
filesystem access.&quot;,

while the manhole code in base Twisted provides a telnet server/client
which allows console access to a Twisted server, and also provides
a very powerful PB-based graphical inspection took (gtkmanhole and
gtk2manhole).  I didn't see any gtkmanhole support in Twisted conch, but
now that I look more closely, I do see a 'tkconch' which seems to have
an overlapping function.  Further, there is no indication in the Twisted
source that the non-conch manhole is deprecated, although that seems to
be implicit from the text on the conch site:
&quot;... A new implementation of Twisted's Manhole application is also
included, featuring server-side input history and interactive syntax
coloring.&quot;
It's further confusing, because conch is an ssh/telnet library, so I
can't see why the manhole support should be there (it would seem logical
that manhole should be a sibling project to conch that depends on it and
Twisted base.

In particular, I want to use the Gnome Canvas object browser
(twisted.manhole.ui.spelunk_gnome), which unfortunately only appears to
be support in gtkmanhole, not gtk2manhole, and certainly not in conch.

My patches were specifically for the twisted.manhole.ui.gtkmanhole and I
can open an issue for them if twisted.manhole isn't really
deprecated.
