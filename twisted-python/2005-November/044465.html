</I>&gt;<i>So, would you use pb/jelly for transferring large chunks of data (e.g.

</I>
Depends on the form of the data.  If it is represented locally as large strings, or lists of integers or floats, or some other simple structure such as that, I would probably use a PB control channel and a secondary data channel.  The secondary channel could speak a trivial protocol, such as int32strings, which would be much faster than any general object serialization mechanism.

Of course, this is just an optimization.  I'd probably start out passing the data inline, and only worry about this once I saw it was causing problems, though keeping this in mind so the APIs are amenable to the change.

&gt;<i>Also, I notice that the pb, jelly and flavors modules are all classified
</I>&gt;<i>as semi-stable. Could you give an indication of what this means in
</I>&gt;<i>practice?
</I>
PB hasn't changed in a manner that is not backwards compatible in years.  There is, of course, the looming juggernaut of newpb...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thank you for your time. I think you have built a very useful/powerful
</I>&gt;<i>framework and am looking forward to using it.

Thanks :)  I hope you have fun building your application.
