Well, we're all grown-ups here and I think I can take it, but it's still
interesting enough to know that you think it's the wrong thing.
Translation -- I'll try not to be offended! :)

The bottom line for me is that I noticed an easy way to do some
parallelization of &quot;embarrassingly parallel&quot; problems which would have a
nice match with the Pythonista mindset: instead of map( func, vars ), we
could have a map_distributed( func, vars ), which gets mapped over many
processes, potentially over many CPUs. I'm thinking now solely of a
single multicore box or clusters behind firewalls, so security issues
didn't seem relevant. I've got some rudimentary Pyro code working, but I
was wondering what was available with Twisted.

&gt;<i> No, Twisted does not support this.  The lack of support is intentional.
</I>&gt;<i> There are a huge number of security-related issued with doing what Pyro
</I>&gt;<i> does, so Twisted doesn't do it.
</I>
OK.

&gt;<i> In fact, PB goes in the other direction: even if the code defining the
</I>&gt;<i> class of an instance passed over PB is available on both sides, it _still_
</I>&gt;<i> might not be accepted by the recipient, if it has not been explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> marked as safe by the recipient.
</I>
OK, thanks. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something in the
spread docs...
