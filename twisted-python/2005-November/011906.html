I don't see why you need a ClassSuite; couldn't a TestCase have optional
pre- and post- hooks called along with the test?

A correctly running trial (not what we have now, cause of all the tests
that do wait() and reactor.iterate()) would call reactor.run() once, and
tests would only support returning Deferreds as a mean for making the
reactor continue. Could we preserve unittest compatability while still
working this way? If not, there's no point in bothering. E.g. it seems
unlikely that a random unittest.py runner program will be able to run
trial tests once we switch to the correct reactor-running strategy.

Any reason we need a whole complex new system when the current one
works?
