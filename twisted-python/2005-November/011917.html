I can say that I do not particularly like having to support 2.2.  =)   
RedHat EL3 (which is still supported by RedHat) still has python 2.2  
though by default.  I don't know what other &quot;still supported&quot;  
distributions might have it.  When I forced &quot;at least 2.3&quot; on my  
PyAIM/PyICQ transport users, I got a fair number of complaints and a  
couple of &quot;well then I can't use your transport&quot;.  I'm not entirely  
sure why one can't just install python 2.3 or higher if that's a  
requirement, but hey.  =)  Anyway, I'd almost be happier if Twisted  
didn't support 2.2 anymore simply because I could use that as a  
catalist for dropping support for it on my end as well.  I actually  
have to implement my own bool class to get real booleans in 2.2.. and  
that file is there only for 2.2.  =/  I can't put any real facts  
behind this, but it &quot;seems&quot; like unicode support isn't as good in 2.2  
either.  That might just be my imagination though.  =D
