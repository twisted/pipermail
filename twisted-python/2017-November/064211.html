</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What is the procedure for accepting patches for platforms for which we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't have a continuous testing system ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is a follow up of the review from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9323">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9323</A>
</I>[snip]
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To support a platform—i.e. to promise we will not break it in the future—we  have to have a builder capable of running Twisted on that platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To accept a patch though, the important thing is to have test coverage. If the change in question is a platform-specific feature that there’s no way to test in a different environment, we would indeed need to block on the availability of a builder.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Quite often—as I believe is the case for the patch you’re referring to here—patches are adjusting behaviors which would be difficult to cleanly integration-test on the platform in question anyway, and the appropriate thing to do is to make some mock match the observed behavior of the platform in question.  In this case it would be nice if the reviewer could verify this, but if the patch submitter’s description of observed behavior is clear, and their test mock implements it correctly, I would say that we can give them the benefit of the doubt and accept such patches even if the reviewer doesn’t have such a platform available.  Assuming all the changed lines are covered adequately for our supported platforms’ behavior as well, of course, and we aren’t risking breaking them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do you feel about this answer?
</I>
Thanks for your comment and I think that I know what a reviewer should
do for  <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9323">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9323</A>
&gt;<i>From the ticket description, we already have a test which fails on
</I>Cygwin and the PR does not add any new tests.
So the options are:

A. Get a builder for cygwin and use the existing tests.
B. Write new unit/integration tests with a fake Cygwin system.

-----

I understand the high-level process, but I have questions regarding the details.

How can a reviewer (which does not have experience and access to an
unsupported platform) verify whether the fake/surrogate implementation
is correct?
That is without putting significant effort and reading the details
about the unsupported platform, and in this process becoming an expert
in that platform?
