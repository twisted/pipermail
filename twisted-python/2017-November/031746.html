<PRE>Hi,

What is the procedure for accepting patches for platforms for which we
don't have a continuous testing system ?

This is a follow up of the review from
<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9323">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9323</A>

There is a patch for Cygwin but AFAIK there is no current builder for
running Twisted with Python on Cygwin.

My first reaction was that before accepting such patches we should set
up a continuous testing system.

With such a system in place we can run the tests to see that the
reported bug is present in trunk and that it is fixed in a branch.

If that can't be done, we need at least someone to manually run the
tests to check the patch.

Twisted is supported on so many systems and I don't think that is OK
to ask reviewers to have each supported system at hand, ready to fire
a manual test.

Any comments?

Thanks,
