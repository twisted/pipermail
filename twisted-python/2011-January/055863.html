Well, you wouldn't necessarily be depending on Twisted, just depending
on Lore - and I imagine any not-Twisted project whose documentation
depends on Lore has already made peace with the idea of depending on
Lore. :)

If it's easier to just copy these well-known DTDs into the lore2sphinx
repository, I guess that's a good plan too - it's not like the W3C is
going to suddenly issue updated XHTML DTDs.
