I'm strongly in favour of setting noisy to False on all factory objects; 
I find their logging tedious, and have a bunch of monkeypatch code in 
most of my projects to import the modules and set the class variable, to 
I don't have to subclass just to do that.

The structured logging proposal sounds interesting and I'm potentially 
willing to give it a go. However, it seems like it would be a lot of 
work and that it would be very likely to sit in Trac review limbo for a 
while (getting ever-harder to merge the branch back in).

(This is not intended as a criticism - merely an observation that even 
tickets for simple problems with patches take a while to get reviewed, 
as manpower is of course a precious and scarce resource)

Do you have any thoughts on how it could be broken down into smaller chunks?
