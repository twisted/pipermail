</I>Huh. Never even knew that was there.  It probably could, and the reason it
downloads from the internet was because that's the default way of doing it
in lxml.  I've since figured out how to override that behavior (which is how
the caching works) so maybe that wouldn't even be hard.  The easiest/fastest
fix for the moment though would probably be to pre-populate the cache as I
mentioned before, since IIRC, this would just involve adding the file to my
hg repo.  I'll have to look into it though, it may be just as easy to do it
the other way, though I don't want to depend necessarily on having Twisted's
code available (remember, this is supposed to work on the various divmod
projects, and anything else that uses Lore, too).
