So, it sounds like it's happening with connections that are (A) faster and (B) shipping around more traffic.  Smells like a possible race condition - and maybe not in Twisted.  Is it possible for you to test with any other OS / kernel variations, to see if it behaves differently on other Linux versions, ideally some with changes to epoll?

I don't know epoll quite well enough to read the strace and tell what's going on.  If those are the only calls being traced... there's no gettimeofday or send or recv calls?  That suggests it's just thrashing, but if your workaround works, other stuff must be going on.  Hmm.  I guess I don't have a clear enough picture for any useful conjecture yet :).  Can you open a bug, and attach a more complete strace, assuming that the one with just the epoll calls was filtered?
