<PRE>Hi Duncan,

Thanks for the response.

I'm certainly open to suggestions otherwise, but it seems patching
txjsonrpc to do the following would be rather involved. I started working
on some of this and realized maintaining backwards compatibility might be
very difficult:

* Persistent TCP connections across requests. At first I thought I could
just add an additional Proxy and Factory. Unfortunately the BaseProxy and
BaseFactory expect a new connection for each request, so this started
getting quite involved and would have either require extensive changes to
all the transports, or a parallel implementation.

* The array issue is a bit strange. The only solution I could think of
would be to add a &quot;wrap_results&quot; keyword or some such to the Proxy
constructor (both client and server, as I think the client compensates for
the array wrapper). It would have to default to True for backwards
compatibility.

* Keyword arguments are not supported (but are allowed by 2.0 spec). I
don't think this would be too hard to add.

I'm on the fence as to whether to attack these issues in txjsonrpc, or to
revert to my 2.0/netstrings only implementation, which itself needs a lot
of work (the code is far from ideal, there are no tests, etc.).

Matthew
