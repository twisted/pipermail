Well, some criticism, now I am listening to you.

&gt;<i> If we re-populated the result, every failed Deferred yielded by an
</I>&gt;<i> inlineCallbacks function would log its traceback twice: once when the
</I>&gt;<i> unhandled exception propagated out of the inlineCallbacks function
</I>&gt;<i> causing its Deferred to fail, and once when the unhandled exception
</I>&gt;<i> propagated from the yielded Deferred itself, since nothing would have
</I>&gt;<i> consumed it when that Deferred would be GC'd.
</I>
Well, this simply means that the change is not that simple to make and
would probably imply some deeper modifications. I can see how this kills
any hope to get the change merged into anything stable anytime soon however.

&gt;<i> Speaking of GC, similarly, any large objects in Deferred results
</I>&gt;<i> processed by inlineCallbacks functions would live longer, and continue
</I>&gt;<i> participating in any reference cycles they're part of, possibly causing
</I>&gt;<i> memory leaks, or at least, longer collection times and less favorable
</I>&gt;<i> memory usage behavior, especially in long-lived processes.
</I>
But.. I definitely agree with this one, which I did not foresee. I
therefore agree that any change in Deferred objects behavior should
never enforce references to live longer when not usually required.

&gt;<i> Basically, you can't treat a Deferred as an event broadcaster.  It isn't
</I>&gt;<i> one.  It's a single-shot representation of an asynchronous result, which
</I>&gt;<i> a single consumer can consume with its current value, possibly yielding
</I>&gt;<i> a new value.
</I>
That I figured out already. Thanks for the reminder anyway, I was on the
path of loosing myself, there :)

&gt;<i> Any
</I>&gt;<i> inlineCallbacks function which wants to express its intent more
</I>&gt;<i> precisely can do this, instead:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     def fork(d):
</I>&gt;<i>         d2 = Deferred()
</I>&gt;<i>         def fire(x):
</I>&gt;<i>             d2.callback(x)
</I>&gt;<i>             return x
</I>&gt;<i>         d.addBoth(fire)
</I>&gt;<i>         return d2
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     @inlineCallbacks
</I>&gt;<i>     def foo():
</I>&gt;<i>         result = yield fork(somethingAsync())
</I>
I will embed this one in my bundle of Twisted utility functions. Thanks!

&gt;<i> Maybe putting that function in Twisted (this is not the first time it's
</I>&gt;<i> come up) would be a useful addition.
</I>
Agreed, then.
