<PRE>Hi,

1. Are Travis OSX builds functional yet? Can we switch to Travis for
OSX builder?

Over <A HREF="https://www.traviscistatus.com/">https://www.traviscistatus.com/</A> I see no backlog for macOS.

------------

2. Right now, when we receive a PR from a non-team member, I think
that the only way to trigger the required tests is to create a new
branch in twisted/twisted.

Then you can go to
<A HREF="https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/boxes-supported?branch=9176-inlinetracebacks-tardyp">https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/boxes-supported?branch=9176-inlinetracebacks-tardyp</A>
and force the tests.

This looks complicated, so what I was doing, is create a new PR.

--------

Am I doing something wrong?
Is there a simple way?
Am I the only one who thinks this is not productive?

--------

What I am thinking is to have a single PR (the once created by the author).

Once a Twisted team member has reviewed/checked the PR, a message like
&quot;Go, Buildbot, go!&quot; can be left as a comment and the Buildbot GH hook
will trigger the stable tests for that branch.

In this way, buildbot runs are only triggered for external branches
after a core team member has checked the code and assure that no
malware is contained.

With GitHub we can do changs to any forked repos... so if small
changes are required, Twisted team members can push directly to the
external forks... not sure if this is a feature or a security bug :)

---------

What do you think?
Do you see any problem in this?
Will such a change make life easier for you?

I should be able to update the current GH Buildbot hook to handle the
proposed change.
