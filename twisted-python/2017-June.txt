Hey friends.

I feel reasonably confident that Twisted is on the cusp of a big
renaissance.  It represents a lot of what I want communications syntax to
feel like, and the metaphors I think are reasonble for representing it, in
the future of Python.

I consider myself now somewhere between a user and a power-user, but I have
repeatedly failed to find a road to become a successful, consistent
contributor.

I count several of you (Glyph, Hawkowl, Itamar, Habnabit, among others) as
among friends and formative influences.

How can I help you with Twisted?  How can you help me move over the cusp
into active, useful contribution?

I investigated them, they're all due to Agent changes -- how they don't use connectSSL anymore, and instead use a wrapped TCP port, and how Agent now uses HostnameEndpoint's GAI resolving. I put up some fixes (although not up to spec for merge) here for JP: https://github.com/LeastAuthority/txkube/pull/135 <https://github.com/LeastAuthority/txkube/pull/135>

I would put these down to an issue in txkube, even if it's not txkube's fault, it's just that Twisted does things differently (and in the case of not using connectSSL, imo better :) ).

Message-ID: <CAEeXt4O3KYRTJkp=NvsNPM1e+UMghR1cw1XFq6_9_366EmzUJA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm pleased to announce a new release of txkube, a Twisted-based
library for interacting with Kubernetes using the HTTP API.  The big
news for this release is compatibility with Kubernetes 1.6 and an
easier path to compatibility with future Kubernetes releases.  This
release also improves txkube's ability to authenticate against
different Kubernetes configurations.


Here is an example of txkube usage, taken from the README:

   from __future__ import print_function
   from twisted.internet.task import react

   from txkube import network_kubernetes_from_context

   @react
   def main(reactor):
       k8s = network_kubernetes_from_context(reactor, u"minikube")
       d = k8s.versioned_client()
       d.addCallback(
           lambda client: client.list(client.model.v1.Namespace)
       )
       d.addCallback(print)
       return d

You can download txkube from PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>.
You can contribute to its development on GitHub
<https://github.com/LeastAuthority/txkube>.

Thanks to Least Authority Enterprises <https://leastauthority.com/>
for sponsoring this development.

OK, let's assume you've read this (have you read it? no? read it.) and that you're looking for a more specific starter task rather than the "code reviews" / "python 3" stuff which is a bit broader:

We really need to get off of the legacy logging system (twisted.python.log) and move onto the new hotness (twisted.logger).  There is implementation work to be done within the Logger system (and thanks to Wilfredo for doing the bulk of that!) but that work is only useful if all of Twisted is consistently emitting structured messages using that system.

So if you could find something that's calling 'log.msg("foo %s" % (bar,))' and make it do 'self._log.info("foo {bar}", bar=bar)', that could move the needle on Twisted's operability, and it should hopefully be easy to do.

Thanks for your interest!

Message-ID: <BB60585A-AF27-4077-ACA1-93003B07371D@atleastfornow.net>

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am honoured to announce the release of Twisted 17.5!

The highlights of this release are:

- twisted.python.url has been spun out into the new 'hyperlink' package; importing twisted.python.url is now a compatibility alias
- Initial support for OpenSSL 1.1.0.
- Fixes around the reactor DNS resolver changes in 17.1, solving all known regressions
- Deferred.asFuture and Deferred.fromFuture, to allow you to map asyncio Futures to Twisted Deferreds and vice versa, for use the with Python 3+ asyncioreactor in Twisted
- Support for TLS 1.3 ciphersuites, in advance of a released OpenSSL to enable the protocol
- Further Python 3 support in twisted.web, initial support in twisted.mail.smtp.

For more information, check the NEWS file (link provided below).

You can find the downloads at <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted>> (or alternatively <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads>>). The NEWS file is also available at <https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-17.5.0/NEWS.rst <https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-17.5.0/NEWS.rst>>.

Many thanks to everyone who had a part in this release - the supporters of the Twisted Software Foundation, the developers who contributed code as well as documentation, and all the people building great things with Twisted!

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Notice of future removal of Python 3.3 and 3.4
	support in Twisted
Message-ID: <6B69B266-3051-4FAD-9E5D-370BCCDE8852@atleastfornow.net>

As per our Compatibility Policy (https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/compatibility-policy.html#supporting-and-de-supporting-python-versions <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/compatibility-policy.html#supporting-and-de-supporting-python-versions>), this is an announcement that Twisted will be officially dropping support for Python 3.3 and Python 3.4 in the release after next.

We currently have no 3.3 or 3.4 builders except on Travis, so these Python versions aren't really "fully supported" per our policy, as no current version of the distributions we test against ship it. However lack of support is different from explicitly dropping support, and so in Twisted 17.5 + two versions, we will be removing compatibility hacks for supporting 3.3 and 3.4, and focusing on 3.5+.

Why don't travis builders imply full support?  My understanding was that CI == supported.

(This is just a procedural concern, I am fine with dropping >2.7<3.5 in the proposed release.)

Hi,

Can you do a follow-on release to 17.5.0 which incorporates
https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/816

Without that fix, e-mail notifications from buildbot are broken in
buildbot's master branch.

With that fix, e-mail notifications from buildbot now work on Python 2 and
Python 3.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Custom log "files" with twisted.logger
Message-ID: <CAEeXt4OtOPKjBgwXbGyuwH5ukFE3P8199xSgyrLxFSZ1X4_0TQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to be able to send events from the new logging system
(twisted.logger) to a remote log collection system.  If I'm using twist then
it seems options for configuring this part of logging are limited.  The
choices appear to be logging to stdout, stdout, or a file on the filesystem.

If I write my own command-line entrypoint then I can probably do whatever I
want by writing a custom observer and hooking it up appropriately.  I'd
rather not have to do that, though.

I could also go back to twistd and use --logger.  But since interest in
twistd appears to be on the decline, in favor of twist, I'd rather avoid
that as well.

It seems like the idea would be something like --logger for twist, perhaps
replacing the --log-file option.  If there were a way to pass some
arguments that would be pretty nice as well.

    twist --logger myapp.something:x=y,a=b
  twist --logger twisted.logger.FileLogObserver.fromPath:path=/foo/bar

(Actual syntax not that important to me; consistency with endpoint syntax
would have some advantages; something that deals with the necessities of
quoting and nesting would be better, of course.   Also, I know everyone
hates Twisted's plugins but they would make for a nicer UI than FQPNs here.)

The first thing I'm likely to do with this is bridge twisted.logger events
to Eliot.  I think this will provide the most useful logs (at least *some* of
the logs from Twisted will have a meaningful Eliot context, though
certainly nowhere near all).  Also I already have a system for configuring
Eliot log destinations (which supports passing along arguments, so I can
already tell Eliot where my remote log collector is with a command-line
argument).

What are the chances of getting support for this scenario into twist itself?

Thanks,
Jean-Paul

Our policy says "buildbot builder" explicitly as the basis for support. Plus, Travis is some Pythons yolo'd onto a random Ubuntu for the purposes of smoke testing for people without access to our full build fleet; and the support for Python in Twisted has so far been on the basis of "what are people actually using" -- hence why we don't have a 3.3 or 3.4, as they are only generally available on EOL'd or enterprise distributions (which are unlikely to be used by people who want/can get the newest Twisted).

To the Twisted infrastructure maintainers,


First and foremost, thanks for your continued efforts and keeping things running.

Second, the certificate I'm getting for https://speed.twistedmatrix.com is issued to a common name "twistedmatrix.com" with no subject alternative names matching "speed.twistedmatrix.com". I suspect this may be improved in the future.

My guess is that when the policy was written, a project had to maintain its
own CI infrastructure
because nothing out there was freely available that was good enough.
Basically, the Twisted project
could either use its own self-maintained buildbot CI infrastructure, or
jhave no CI at all.

The landscape has changed a lot now.
With Github + Travis/Appveyor/etc. are very good for CI.  While the
configurations and versions of the OS and software
used by Travis and Appveyor are out of the control of the Twisted project,
they are quite good for most purposes.
I would say that the Windows configurations on Appveyor are as good or
better than Twisted's Windows buildbots.

I don't really think that Twisted's buildbot infrastructure is some holy
grail of "what are people actually using".

I think it is fair to say that the Twisted's buildbot infrastructure
represents what the Twisted
project managed to set up and get working at some point of time, and the
buildbots cover a good cross-section
of configurations and operating systems that are not covered by
Travis/Appveyor/etc.

I think it is best for the Twisted release engineer to look at the results
of all the Travis/Appveyor builds *and* the buildbot builds
and decide what is supported or not.  That already happens now, because
some of the buildbot builds are tagged as unsupported.

Plus, Travis is some Pythons yolo'd onto a random Ubuntu for the purposes of smoke testing for people without access to our full build fleet; and the support for Python in Twisted has so far been on the basis of "what are people actually using" -- hence why we don't have a 3.3 or 3.4, as they are only generally available on EOL'd or enterprise distributions (which are unlikely to be used by people who want/can get the newest Twisted).

Counterpoint: `docker pull python:3.4`.

The 'yolo'd versions are nevertheless builds of the official pythonX.Y source, and "custom build" is a configuration that huge numbers of very prominent users stick to these days.

This guess is pretty much accurate.  At the time, "buildbot" was a synonym for "CI", and that is entirely the spirit in which it was written.

Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves :-).

The Appveyor setup is to test Windows server builds, and the buildbots are to ensure that desktop versions that users actually use are still supported.

Indeed not.

I basically agree with all of this, and I think the policy language should be changed to better reflect its original intent in a modern context.

Hi,

I'm trying to post a documentation bug (ReverseProxyResource says the path parameter type is str, but actually it needs to be bytes)

I'm trying to access http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/newticket but I get an Error: Forbidden

When I try to log in at http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/login I get an Error: Not Found

Thanks in advance,

If you go to http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/newticket while you're not
logged in, you'll see a message at the top that tells you to log in (link
text is "do so"). It's pointing at that old login URL.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] How to call super() using attrs?
Message-ID: <20170620095451.GA1869@riseup.net>

I am trying to use attrs in a class that inherits from Thread but I
have not found a way to call super():

    >>> @attr.s
    ... class T(Thread, object):
    ...     def __attr_post_init__(self):
    ...             super(T, self).__init__()
    ... 
    >>> t = T()
    >>> t.start()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py", line 737, in start
        raise RuntimeError("thread.__init__() not called")
    RuntimeError: thread.__init__() not called

I even tried to call that in __attr_post_init__(), but maybe super()
should be called in a pre-init method?

Thanks,
-Felipe

Subject: [Twisted-Python] lineCallbacks failure message difference between
	python2 and 3
Message-ID: <CAC5teVmEryJc4OfV5FN71MSXHAUcxH2XpEj37RiY_f1UCvN3iA@mail.gmail.com>

Here's code that generates an error on line #9 in f1()

  1 import time, sys
  2 from twisted.internet import reactor
  3 from twisted.internet.task import deferLater
  4 from twisted.internet.defer import inlineCallbacks
  5
  6 @inlineCallbacks
  7 def f1():
  8     yield time.time()
  9     {'a': 'A', 'b': 'B'}['c'] # KeyError
 10
 11 @inlineCallbacks
 12 def f2():
 13     yield f1()
 14
 15 def on_err(failure):
 16     print("on_err: ===>", failure.getErrorMessage())
 17     failure.printTraceback(file=sys.stderr)
 18     if reactor.running:
 19         reactor.stop()
 20
 21 def done(*args, **kargs):
 22     print("done.")
 23     reactor.stop()
 24
 25 deferLater(reactor, 0, f2).addCallback(done).addErrback(on_err)
 26 reactor.run()

running w/ python 2.7 outputs this:

--- <exception caught here> ---
  File ".....\lib\site-packages\twisted\internet\defer.py", line 1128, in
_inlineCallbacks
    result = g.send(result)
  File "../temp/tb.py", line 9, in f1
    {'a': 'A', 'b': 'B'}['c']
exceptions.KeyError: 'c'



python 3.6.1 (twisted 17.5.0) outputs this:

  File ".....\lib\site-packages\twisted\internet\defer.py", line 1299, in
_inlineCallbacks
    result = result.throwExceptionIntoGenerator(g)
  File ".....\lib\site-packages\twisted\python\failure.py", line 393, in
throwExceptionIntoGenerator
    return g.throw(self.type, self.value, self.tb)
  File "../temp/tb.py", line 13, in f2
    yield f1()
builtins.KeyError: 'c'


I can know there is a failure in f1() but line and other specifics are
dropped
changing line #25 to call f1() gives a better message, so it's something
related to stack frame.
Is there any way (aside from adding logging at each level to
internet/defer.py:_inlineCallbacks) to get a better error message in py3?


thank you

Aaron,

Pierre Tardy submitted this patch for precisely the problem you described:

 https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/814

It needs a bit more work to pass the unit tests.

If someone could up a PR against braid (probably a redirect in https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/blob/master/services/t-web/twisted-web/twisted-web <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/blob/master/services/t-web/twisted-web/twisted-web> since that link is generated somewhere inside Trac and is not present in our configuration as far as I can tell) that would be great :)

Message-ID: <CAG=rPVeN9XHYGPW8QJFg0g=xMpzmRO4AtmeqmpfL_Q6zq3XWSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I tried to set up a VM to test changes to Twisted's buildbot.

I did this:


git clone https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid
cd braid
vagrant up
fab config.vagrant
fab config.vagrant base.bootstrap
fab config.vagrant buildbot.install


I got some errors at this point (see attached log).

Any ideas how to get this working?

Thanks.

I am not a python packages expert, but it looks like the `pbr` lib has
some errors. And pbr was installed due to `mock`.
I think that you can try pinning an older version of the `pbr` or of `mock`.

For production usage, I think that we should pin everything, so that
we don't end up with things which might break in the future.

Cheers,
Adi

Very much agreed.  As per https://caremad.io/posts/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/ <https://caremad.io/posts/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/>, any actual deployments need to have "exact version specifiers" (i.e.: pins) on everything.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Question regarding patch submission
Message-ID: <20170626033426.GA1208@arch-tinker.localdomain>

Hello,
Quick question regarding #15 of
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedDevelopment#SubmittingaPatch.

The step indicates that history shouldn't be re-written and the branch
should be rebased over trunk.  Pretty straightforward, introduce new commits,
don't mess with the old ones.

However, after incorporating review comments in new commits and,
force-pushing the feature branch, is it expected that the review comments may
be damaged?

An example is:
 https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/793

The review comment on May 25 leads to nowhere because that file appeared in
trunk and was dropped when it was rebased.  Not the end of the world, but might
make reviewing the history on subsequent iterations of the PR a little strange.

Thanks!
-Jason Litzinger

Hi,

            I use Buildbot ( 0.9.7 ) and Twisted (==17.1.0) to run git poller,

            Config is below.

       c['change_source'].append(changes.GitPoller(
        repourl='git at 172.23.45.81:/home/git/201701_postrack_swfw_app', branch='master',pollinterval=300, pollAtLaunch=True,
        gitbin="C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\\git.exe",
        encoding="big5"))

       But it always to get the following exception :
      Can anybody tell whatâ€™s going wrong ? thanks!

      Jacky

I think this is expected; this is just an unfortunate shortcoming of GitHub
PR reviews.

Buildbot: 0.9.8 and Python 3.6.1.
But the result is the same.

This is a bug in buildbot.  I think it was reported here:

I found this particular problem was due to the fact that
if I followed the instructions in the braid README,
pip version 1.0 is installed on the system.  This is a really ancient
version of pip, and installing the latest versions of mock and pbr fail
with it.

The comment about rebasing predates our current process; it was from the days when we were using SVN.  Nowadays we usually just merge trunk in to the branch.

Yikes, definitely didn't do that on the PR above, will from now on.

If that is preferred, then should step 15 be re-worded to state:
"Don't push your changes by rewriting the history, merge trunk into your
branch."

?

I'm fine making the wiki change, but as these are part of the submission
process, seems like at least an ACK or two is in order.

Message-ID: <CAEgpGv5VmstydR5-GHq=iBSpujNqz3BUaGmeP4XC8kjo95GtqQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

So a long while back I volunteered to write a library to supply functions
to replace pywin32 with a cffi backed implementation. Quite a bit of time
has gone by since and about a year ago I closed the issue[0] where I was
keeping track of the major functions, constants and structures I needed to
implement to even consider replacing pywin32.

With that issue closed pywincffi may be in a position where the conversion
can start. Sadly however I don't have the time myself to invest in the
effort because I have a couple of other projects that have shifted my
priorities. If there's someone here who does have the time to invest in the
conversion I'm happy to support their efforts wherever I can.

Hey friends.

I feel reasonably confident that Twisted is on the cusp of a big
renaissance.  It represents a lot of what I want communications syntax to
feel like, and the metaphors I think are reasonble for representing it, in
the future of Python.

I consider myself now somewhere between a user and a power-user, but I have
repeatedly failed to find a road to become a successful, consistent
contributor.

I count several of you (Glyph, Hawkowl, Itamar, Habnabit, among others) as
among friends and formative influences.

How can I help you with Twisted?  How can you help me move over the cusp
into active, useful contribution?

I investigated them, they're all due to Agent changes -- how they don't use connectSSL anymore, and instead use a wrapped TCP port, and how Agent now uses HostnameEndpoint's GAI resolving. I put up some fixes (although not up to spec for merge) here for JP: https://github.com/LeastAuthority/txkube/pull/135 <https://github.com/LeastAuthority/txkube/pull/135>

I would put these down to an issue in txkube, even if it's not txkube's fault, it's just that Twisted does things differently (and in the case of not using connectSSL, imo better :) ).

Message-ID: <CAEeXt4O3KYRTJkp=NvsNPM1e+UMghR1cw1XFq6_9_366EmzUJA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm pleased to announce a new release of txkube, a Twisted-based
library for interacting with Kubernetes using the HTTP API.  The big
news for this release is compatibility with Kubernetes 1.6 and an
easier path to compatibility with future Kubernetes releases.  This
release also improves txkube's ability to authenticate against
different Kubernetes configurations.


Here is an example of txkube usage, taken from the README:

   from __future__ import print_function
   from twisted.internet.task import react

   from txkube import network_kubernetes_from_context

   @react
   def main(reactor):
       k8s = network_kubernetes_from_context(reactor, u"minikube")
       d = k8s.versioned_client()
       d.addCallback(
           lambda client: client.list(client.model.v1.Namespace)
       )
       d.addCallback(print)
       return d

You can download txkube from PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>.
You can contribute to its development on GitHub
<https://github.com/LeastAuthority/txkube>.

Thanks to Least Authority Enterprises <https://leastauthority.com/>
for sponsoring this development.

OK, let's assume you've read this (have you read it? no? read it.) and that you're looking for a more specific starter task rather than the "code reviews" / "python 3" stuff which is a bit broader:

We really need to get off of the legacy logging system (twisted.python.log) and move onto the new hotness (twisted.logger).  There is implementation work to be done within the Logger system (and thanks to Wilfredo for doing the bulk of that!) but that work is only useful if all of Twisted is consistently emitting structured messages using that system.

So if you could find something that's calling 'log.msg("foo %s" % (bar,))' and make it do 'self._log.info("foo {bar}", bar=bar)', that could move the needle on Twisted's operability, and it should hopefully be easy to do.

Thanks for your interest!

Message-ID: <BB60585A-AF27-4077-ACA1-93003B07371D@atleastfornow.net>

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am honoured to announce the release of Twisted 17.5!

The highlights of this release are:

- twisted.python.url has been spun out into the new 'hyperlink' package; importing twisted.python.url is now a compatibility alias
- Initial support for OpenSSL 1.1.0.
- Fixes around the reactor DNS resolver changes in 17.1, solving all known regressions
- Deferred.asFuture and Deferred.fromFuture, to allow you to map asyncio Futures to Twisted Deferreds and vice versa, for use the with Python 3+ asyncioreactor in Twisted
- Support for TLS 1.3 ciphersuites, in advance of a released OpenSSL to enable the protocol
- Further Python 3 support in twisted.web, initial support in twisted.mail.smtp.

For more information, check the NEWS file (link provided below).

You can find the downloads at <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted>> (or alternatively <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads>>). The NEWS file is also available at <https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-17.5.0/NEWS.rst <https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-17.5.0/NEWS.rst>>.

Many thanks to everyone who had a part in this release - the supporters of the Twisted Software Foundation, the developers who contributed code as well as documentation, and all the people building great things with Twisted!

Twisted Regards,
Amber Brown (HawkOwl)

	support in Twisted
Message-ID: <6B69B266-3051-4FAD-9E5D-370BCCDE8852@atleastfornow.net>

As per our Compatibility Policy (https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/compatibility-policy.html#supporting-and-de-supporting-python-versions <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/compatibility-policy.html#supporting-and-de-supporting-python-versions>), this is an announcement that Twisted will be officially dropping support for Python 3.3 and Python 3.4 in the release after next.

We currently have no 3.3 or 3.4 builders except on Travis, so these Python versions aren't really "fully supported" per our policy, as no current version of the distributions we test against ship it. However lack of support is different from explicitly dropping support, and so in Twisted 17.5 + two versions, we will be removing compatibility hacks for supporting 3.3 and 3.4, and focusing on 3.5+.

Why don't travis builders imply full support?  My understanding was that CI == supported.

(This is just a procedural concern, I am fine with dropping >2.7<3.5 in the proposed release.)

https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/816

Without that fix, e-mail notifications from buildbot are broken in
buildbot's master branch.

With that fix, e-mail notifications from buildbot now work on Python 2 and
Python 3.

Thanks.

Yes, without this fix it is broken on python 2 also.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Custom log "files" with twisted.logger
Message-ID: <CAEeXt4OtOPKjBgwXbGyuwH5ukFE3P8199xSgyrLxFSZ1X4_0TQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I would like to be able to send events from the new logging system
(twisted.logger) to a remote log collection system.  If I'm using twist then
it seems options for configuring this part of logging are limited.  The
choices appear to be logging to stdout, stdout, or a file on the filesystem.

If I write my own command-line entrypoint then I can probably do whatever I
want by writing a custom observer and hooking it up appropriately.  I'd
rather not have to do that, though.

I could also go back to twistd and use --logger.  But since interest in
twistd appears to be on the decline, in favor of twist, I'd rather avoid
that as well.

It seems like the idea would be something like --logger for twist, perhaps
replacing the --log-file option.  If there were a way to pass some
arguments that would be pretty nice as well.

    twist --logger myapp.something:x=y,a=b
  twist --logger twisted.logger.FileLogObserver.fromPath:path=/foo/bar

(Actual syntax not that important to me; consistency with endpoint syntax
would have some advantages; something that deals with the necessities of
quoting and nesting would be better, of course.   Also, I know everyone
hates Twisted's plugins but they would make for a nicer UI than FQPNs here.)

The first thing I'm likely to do with this is bridge twisted.logger events
to Eliot.  I think this will provide the most useful logs (at least *some* of
the logs from Twisted will have a meaningful Eliot context, though
certainly nowhere near all).  Also I already have a system for configuring
Eliot log destinations (which supports passing along arguments, so I can
already tell Eliot where my remote log collector is with a command-line
argument).

What are the chances of getting support for this scenario into twist itself?

Thanks,
Jean-Paul

Our policy says "buildbot builder" explicitly as the basis for support. Plus, Travis is some Pythons yolo'd onto a random Ubuntu for the purposes of smoke testing for people without access to our full build fleet; and the support for Python in Twisted has so far been on the basis of "what are people actually using" -- hence why we don't have a 3.3 or 3.4, as they are only generally available on EOL'd or enterprise distributions (which are unlikely to be used by people who want/can get the newest Twisted).

To the Twisted infrastructure maintainers,


First and foremost, thanks for your continued efforts and keeping things running.

Second, the certificate I'm getting for https://speed.twistedmatrix.com is issued to a common name "twistedmatrix.com" with no subject alternative names matching "speed.twistedmatrix.com". I suspect this may be improved in the future.

My 2c after reading and following the links in the new wiki entry at https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Coverage

My guess is that when the policy was written, a project had to maintain its
own CI infrastructure
because nothing out there was freely available that was good enough.
Basically, the Twisted project
could either use its own self-maintained buildbot CI infrastructure, or
jhave no CI at all.

The landscape has changed a lot now.
With Github + Travis/Appveyor/etc. are very good for CI.  While the
configurations and versions of the OS and software
used by Travis and Appveyor are out of the control of the Twisted project,
they are quite good for most purposes.
I would say that the Windows configurations on Appveyor are as good or
better than Twisted's Windows buildbots.

I don't really think that Twisted's buildbot infrastructure is some holy
grail of "what are people actually using".

I think it is fair to say that the Twisted's buildbot infrastructure
represents what the Twisted
project managed to set up and get working at some point of time, and the
buildbots cover a good cross-section
of configurations and operating systems that are not covered by
Travis/Appveyor/etc.

I think it is best for the Twisted release engineer to look at the results
of all the Travis/Appveyor builds *and* the buildbot builds
and decide what is supported or not.  That already happens now, because
some of the buildbot builds are tagged as unsupported.

Counterpoint: `docker pull python:3.4`.

The 'yolo'd versions are nevertheless builds of the official pythonX.Y source, and "custom build" is a configuration that huge numbers of very prominent users stick to these days.

This guess is pretty much accurate.  At the time, "buildbot" was a synonym for "CI", and that is entirely the spirit in which it was written.

Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves :-).

The Appveyor setup is to test Windows server builds, and the buildbots are to ensure that desktop versions that users actually use are still supported.

Indeed not.

I basically agree with all of this, and I think the policy language should be changed to better reflect its original intent in a modern context.

Thanks for noticing this, exvito.

https://speed.twistedmatrix.com <https://speed.twistedmatrix.com/> should now be properly configured.

If you go to http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/newticket while you're not
logged in, you'll see a message at the top that tells you to log in (link
text is "do so"). It's pointing at that old login URL.

    ...             super(T, self).__init__()

      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py", line 737, in start
        raise RuntimeError("thread.__init__() not called")
    RuntimeError: thread.__init__() not called

I even tried to call that in __attr_post_init__(), but maybe super()
should be called in a pre-init method?

  File ".....\lib\site-packages\twisted\internet\defer.py", line 1128, in
_inlineCallbacks
    result = g.send(result)
  File "../temp/tb.py", line 9, in f1
    {'a': 'A', 'b': 'B'}['c']
exceptions.KeyError: 'c'



python 3.6.1 (twisted 17.5.0) outputs this:

  File ".....\lib\site-packages\twisted\internet\defer.py", line 1299, in
_inlineCallbacks
    result = result.throwExceptionIntoGenerator(g)
  File ".....\lib\site-packages\twisted\python\failure.py", line 393, in
throwExceptionIntoGenerator
    return g.throw(self.type, self.value, self.tb)
  File "../temp/tb.py", line 13, in f2
    yield f1()
builtins.KeyError: 'c'


I can know there is a failure in f1() but line and other specifics are
dropped
changing line #25 to call f1() gives a better message, so it's something
related to stack frame.
Is there any way (aside from adding logging at each level to
internet/defer.py:_inlineCallbacks) to get a better error message in py3?


thank you

Aaron,

Pierre Tardy submitted this patch for precisely the problem you described:

 https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/814

It needs a bit more work to pass the unit tests.

If someone could up a PR against braid (probably a redirect in https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/blob/master/services/t-web/twisted-web/twisted-web <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/blob/master/services/t-web/twisted-web/twisted-web> since that link is generated somewhere inside Trac and is not present in our configuration as far as I can tell) that would be great :)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] How to set up Twisted buildbot VM?
Message-ID: <CAG=rPVeN9XHYGPW8QJFg0g=xMpzmRO4AtmeqmpfL_Q6zq3XWSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I tried to set up a VM to test changes to Twisted's buildbot.

I did this:


git clone https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid
cd braid
vagrant up
fab config.vagrant
fab config.vagrant base.bootstrap
fab config.vagrant buildbot.install


I got some errors at this point (see attached log).

Any ideas how to get this working?

Thanks.

I am not a python packages expert, but it looks like the `pbr` lib has
some errors. And pbr was installed due to `mock`.
I think that you can try pinning an older version of the `pbr` or of `mock`.

For production usage, I think that we should pin everything, so that
we don't end up with things which might break in the future.

Cheers,
Adi

Very much agreed.  As per https://caremad.io/posts/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/ <https://caremad.io/posts/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/>, any actual deployments need to have "exact version specifiers" (i.e.: pins) on everything.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Question regarding patch submission
Message-ID: <20170626033426.GA1208@arch-tinker.localdomain>

Hello,
Quick question regarding #15 of
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedDevelopment#SubmittingaPatch.

The step indicates that history shouldn't be re-written and the branch
should be rebased over trunk.  Pretty straightforward, introduce new commits,
don't mess with the old ones.

However, after incorporating review comments in new commits and,
force-pushing the feature branch, is it expected that the review comments may
be damaged?

An example is:
 https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/793

The review comment on May 25 leads to nowhere because that file appeared in
trunk and was dropped when it was rebased.  Not the end of the world, but might
make reviewing the history on subsequent iterations of the PR a little strange.

Thanks!
-Jason Litzinger

Message-ID: <e109b1829154446d9ad2f3287d075d47@mtkmbs08n1.mediatek.inc>

Hi,

            I use Buildbot ( 0.9.7 ) and Twisted (==17.1.0) to run git poller,

            Config is below.

       c['change_source'].append(changes.GitPoller(
        repourl='git at 172.23.45.81:/home/git/201701_postrack_swfw_app', branch='master',pollinterval=300, pollAtLaunch=True,
        gitbin="C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd\\git.exe",
        encoding="big5"))

       But it always to get the following exception :
      Can anybody tell whatâ€™s going wrong ? thanks!

      Jacky

I think this is expected; this is just an unfortunate shortcoming of GitHub
PR reviews.

I have tried :
Buildbot: 0.9.8 and Python 3.6.1.
But the result is the same.

I found this particular problem was due to the fact that
if I followed the instructions in the braid README,
pip version 1.0 is installed on the system.  This is a really ancient
version of pip, and installing the latest versions of mock and pbr fail
with it.

The comment about rebasing predates our current process; it was from the days when we were using SVN.  Nowadays we usually just merge trunk in to the branch.

Yikes, definitely didn't do that on the PR above, will from now on.

If that is preferred, then should step 15 be re-worded to state:
"Don't push your changes by rewriting the history, merge trunk into your
branch."

?

I'm fine making the wiki change, but as these are part of the submission
process, seems like at least an ACK or two is in order.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] pywin32 to pywincff conversion (help needed)
Message-ID: <CAEgpGv5VmstydR5-GHq=iBSpujNqz3BUaGmeP4XC8kjo95GtqQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

So a long while back I volunteered to write a library to supply functions
to replace pywin32 with a cffi backed implementation. Quite a bit of time
has gone by since and about a year ago I closed the issue[0] where I was
keeping track of the major functions, constants and structures I needed to
implement to even consider replacing pywin32.

With that issue closed pywincffi may be in a position where the conversion
can start. Sadly however I don't have the time myself to invest in the
effort because I have a couple of other projects that have shifted my
priorities. If there's someone here who does have the time to invest in the
conversion I'm happy to support their efforts wherever I can.
