Hmmm- yes I suppose for ease of transportation to
other systems/OSes it makes sense-

&gt;<i> I strongly suggest reading the tutorial [in CVS] --
</I>&gt;<i> it starts out using
</I>&gt;<i> reactor.run(), and eventually progresses to use
</I>&gt;<i> application.
</I>
Hmmm- so there are updated docs in CVS?
I'll check them out-

Speaking of- just as commentary from someone totally
new to twisted-
There's a lot of documentation on the site- almost all
of my questions have been answered by looking through
it.
But- I must say that it is really lacking in
organization- there are very important points in
certain spots that seem like they are just anecdotally
added to the previous paragraph.  Many times I have
wanted to refer back to some document so find some
point, and I have been entirely unable to find the
right one.
(like when I was deciphering exactly what the rpy
files were supposed to be used for)
There are no less than 4 seperate places where rpys
are discussed- and only by reading *all 4* of them do
you understand.
Anyway- most of you are probably all aware of that,
but just thought I'd mention it (as someone coming in
fresh) :)
