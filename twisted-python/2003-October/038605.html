Well, I guess that means me :) 

First things first: you don't *need* app. Writing a Python script which
ends with .run() is a perfectly fine way to run Twisted. As long as you
can afford to modify it whenever you want profiling information. And
as long as you are willing to modify it whenever you want a log file.
And as long as you are sure backgrounding is a good enough approximation
for you. And as long as you don't need pid files. But at some point,
you are likely to want those things. twisted.application is a way to
*separate configuration from deployment*. It represents a layer of indirection
between your code (so-called business logic) and between the running, with
all the traditional costs and benefits of such indirection.

I strongly suggest reading the tutorial [in CVS] -- it starts out using
reactor.run(), and eventually progresses to use application. I think the
most important thing, for me, here is the core realization: your code
should (probably) know very little about whether it is being used with
an application or just a reactor.run(). Even when using Services, you
can easily have your script do something like:

s.startService()
reactor.run()
s.stopService()
