For legal questions, it's best to ask a lawyer. My non-lawyer advice is
&quot;yes&quot;, but IANAL.

That's bad. It's not a terribly good practice. If you have useful patches,
it's probably better to send them to us so we can integrate them. Better
for us, since we have a better Twisted, and better for you, since you
don't have to maintain and forward-port your changes. In some cases,
you might be fixing something that doesn't need fixing -- and then we'll
be able to show you a better way. Better for us, because we have a better
feeling of what needs more documentation, and better for you, since your
code is better.

&gt;<i> Another concern is that twisted is becoming larger and larger. I actually

</I>&gt;<i> twisted.python). Is there an easy way to make a small package? Thanks!

One easy thing to do is to base your distribution on the NoDocs packages.
Much of the size of Twisted is there. I'm not a big fan of &quot;small
distributions&quot; since that requires more support for strange configurations
from the developers. Is &lt;1MB of bzipped sources really that much? If
you want something really deployable, you'll have to include Python
anyway, and that would dwarf the size of Twisted.
