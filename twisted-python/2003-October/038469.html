  This sounds like a complex problem, and I am by no means an expert,
however, I'll take a stab...

  Returning NS records of the authority for unhandled names is something
t.names doesn't support.  It should not be difficult to add, though.  This
would probably be done by creating a new kind of Resolver, once that just
looked up and return NS records, regardless of query type, and putting it at
the back of the resolver chain.

  Aside from implementing this, everything else for the scenario you
describe is probably already supported, the trick is just configuring all
the pieces properly.

  So, you probably want just two resolvers in a ResolverChain, in a server
running on the internal interface of each of these networks (I'm not sure if
this would be the WAN network, or a private network for each participating
organisation).  The first resolver would be your preloaded CacheResolver,
the second would be the new NS resolver described above.  Arguably the NS
resolver should be present in t.names for it to be a proper nameserver
anyway... but that is a different discussion :)

  I'm not sure I've said anything insightful, but I hope it helps.
