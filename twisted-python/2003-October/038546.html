I have added some notes to other aspects of the Twisted documentation to 
try to bridge this communication gap.  Any document where the thing 
being documented is under heavy development should clearly and loudly 
say that.

I mention this because I agree with Donovan's point here, but sometimes 
writing documentation for code can be as enlightening a process as 
writing test-cases for it; possibly revealing ways to produce 
backwards-compatible refactorings without endangering correctness.  I 
don't want to discourage anyone from doing that.  If you do it, though, 
understand that you may have to maintain the document forward to a new 
interface when it changes.
