Hmm.. Well, I think it should probably expose a line-based interface,
but you may have to implement it yourself without
LineReceiver. &quot;Prompts&quot; are ubiquitous in telnet-based services, so
you're going to have to handle that case. You can never tell when a
prompt will be received, so using LineReceiver at all is
futile. Perhaps there could be two event-methods, lineReceived and
promptReceived, where promptReceived is called when input has been
received that matches a user-defined &quot;prompt pattern&quot;, and no data has
been received for N.n seconds after that input was received?

I recommend just implementing it however you need it to be implemented
and posting a patch to the bug tracker. Someone (perhaps me) will take
a look at it.
