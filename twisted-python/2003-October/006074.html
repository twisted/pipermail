Yes, we'd need to write an extension or depend on ctypes to do this for 
win32 if win32all can't do it.  Twisted is not &quot;pure python&quot;, but it 
will work without any C extension modules.

&gt;<i> Some things we would have to think of: For most of the stuff there

</I>&gt;<i> Well, just some thoughts, I didn't have time to try anything yet.
</I>
Well if it's not available, it won't work.. perhaps we'd have to divide 
it up into multiple interfaces, and have some sort of gestalt mechanism 
where you can ask if the reactor can provide the service on the 
particular platform it's currently running on.
