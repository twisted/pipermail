<PRE>well, my only use of the db object directly is for actually updating the
table. my particular implementation would have far more views than
updates, so i was going to cache the common data, or possibly pre-render
html...

wouldn't you say that these performance issues are as much of a
consequence of poor design as much as the choice to use SQL? obviously db
calls are expensive...but some of the benefits of a portable datasource
are worthwhile. as nice as it would be to live in a world where pickle was
a common data format, we're not there yet...

</I>&gt;<i> I won't reply to your question here, I'm sure someone more competent
</I>&gt;<i> than me can do so.
</I>&gt;<i> I will take a minute to note that for some reason, the instinct of
</I>&gt;<i> web developers has been to immediately write applications in the
</I>&gt;<i> LAMP model. While twisted.web is a perfectly good substitute for
</I>&gt;<i> A, and can indeed be used this way, it is much more capable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> LAMP -- Linux Apache MySQL PHP [each of those has variants]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Linux (and most other things in the &quot;L&quot; place, such as FreeBSD) has
</I>&gt;<i> an incredibly fast fork() operation. This leads people to write their
</I>&gt;<i> web code with the process-per-page model. Apache optimizes this by
</I>&gt;<i> preforking, making such code actually scalable enough to deliver good
</I>&gt;<i> response times. However, suddenly there is a problem: since different
</I>&gt;<i> processes are likely to deal with the same user, memory becomes fragile.
</I>&gt;<i> It is unsafe to put things in memory: processes switch users, get born
</I>&gt;<i> and die too often. In Linux, and most other Unices, file locking has
</I>&gt;<i> been a thorny issue. So instead of putting data in files, where the
</I>&gt;<i> subtle semantics of locking and concurrency should be dealt with,
</I>&gt;<i> data tends to end up in the database. That means *all* data. Sessions.
</I>&gt;<i> Temporary &quot;show this message when the user finished his redirect loop&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Etc. etc. Once all the data is in MySQL, which is the easiest database to
</I>&gt;<i> set up, it becomes natural for the average page to be a &quot;glorified
</I>&gt;<i> select&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> PHP was designed for this exact scenario: take a select table and spruce
</I>&gt;<i> it up with HTML.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, what LAMP deals to is exactly to this: inevitably, all
</I>&gt;<i> pages are just spruced up select-tables. This makes programming somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> unnatural unless you're programming a database viewer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With twisted.web, you don't have these problems. It is easy to keep data
</I>&gt;<i> in files, because locking is not an issue. It is easy to cache data in
</I>&gt;<i> memory
</I>&gt;<i> because everything is served from a single process. If you need to attach
</I>&gt;<i> state to a user's session, you can just keep an object in the session.
</I>&gt;<i> This means programming twisted.web should be a lot more like writing
</I>&gt;<i> a GUI application, and a lot less like writing select-with-HTML.
</I>&gt;<i> You should probably reconsider whether you really want MySQL. It adds
</I>&gt;<i> complexity to your application, and the gain is usually small. Putting
</I>&gt;<i> persistent data in files, and using liberal caching schemes, also plays
</I>&gt;<i> on the core advantage of Linux (and similar) -- it uses the incredibly
</I>&gt;<i> optimized caching algorithms.
