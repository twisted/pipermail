<PRE>
     First off, many thanks for the responses everyone, they are 
certainly appreciated!

     Comments below.

     That's interesting (and good) to know.

     However I think ultimately whether PyQt4 or PySide was used as a 
base library for the qt4reactor, the next step would still have to be 
chasing down the remaining contributors to the reactor code and 
confirming they are willing to re-license their work.

     I might attach a request to the last ticket in the tracker as a 
start, and see if that gets any response. I'm only a user of Twisted and 
don't feel comfortable directly hassling folks who were kind enough to 
donate their time to its development.

&gt;&gt;<i> The more fundamental question, IMHO, is the status and critical mass of

</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
     Not to drift too far off topic, but from some initial exploratory 
development I can confirm PySide does seem a pretty complete and 
reliable alternative to PyQt4 (at least under Linux). I've manage to 
produce a basic interface using Qt4Designer and integrate a simple JSON 
client which runs equally well under both library wrapper modules.

     In the short term QtNetwork will probably be sufficient for my 
needs, but I would still advocate and support where/as possible a stable 
qt4reactor running under Twisted.


Cheers
