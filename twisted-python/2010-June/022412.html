Can you point to some specific examples in the current release, and note what they should have been?

Generally speaking, I agree.  But I think we need to nail down a very specific proposal if this is to improve.  What should reviewers be looking for in a good news fragment?  What are pitfalls to avoid?  Asking reviewers to look at something that isn't clearly spelled out may just result in more churn in reviews; I'd hate to see an extra round trip on a ticket because of an oxford comma placement in the news fragment.

&gt;<i> If the guidelines for news fragment content on the review process wiki 
</I>&gt;<i> page are unclear or insufficient, please complain and we can work on 
</I>&gt;<i> improving the weaknesses.
</I>
There's very little in the way of stylistic guidance on this page.

For one thing, I suspect there were a lot of fixes which could have been a '.misc' but were instead a '.feature' or '.bugfix'.  We need some better guidelines for what exactly constitutes a change that is interesting to users.

It advises that a single sentence be written about a change to an FQPN.  This is hard to do well for new features.  For example, &quot;twisted.internet.endpoints now ... exists&quot; doesn't really scan, and doesn't really emphasize the importance of the feature relative to some of the other small fixes which have been added.  I feel like I probably wrote too much of a dissertation in 1442.feature and not enough of a description in 990.feature, but I don't know what would have been better.  If you know something should be a highlight, how should that be indicated?  Should the highlight text be different from the news fragment text?

For complicated bugfixes it's also sometimes awkward, because it's hard to briefly describe a subtle, but still potentially important change in behavior.

A list of 10 examples of &quot;good&quot; feature descriptions and &quot;good&quot; bugfix descriptions would go a long way towards improving this.

Thanks for raising the issue though.  I would also like to see a more coherent NEWS file for 10.2 :).
