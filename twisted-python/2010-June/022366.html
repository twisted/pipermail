This isn't storing a protocol instance, just the protocol class. It then 
instantiates that class in the buildProtocol() method. This is a common 
pattern that lets you override settings easily by subclassing.

This is also not storing an instance in a class variable. It simply has 
a 'default' value of None, which is overridden at the instance level in 
SimpleIMAP4ClientFactory.buildProtocol().

Instance variables always override class variables. Additionally, 
declaring a class variable has no effect on subsequent instance 
assignments (unless it's an attribute descriptor, but twisted doesn't 
use those). If all your initial instance values are immutable (like 
None) you can forgo having an __init__ method at all and simply declare 
them at the class level as was done here.


To answer your question in a hypothetical sense, no it would not make 
sense to store either of those things in a class variable.
