I think you nailed the status - it's an externally maintained reactor 
which probably works for some people.  As far as plans for support go, 
there aren't really any.  Most Twisted development happens without many 
specific plans though, so you shouldn't let that discourage you.

This isn't really specific to Qt - actually it's about Gtk - but it 
might be useful anyway.  A number of issues with Gtk's network support 
have recently led me to believe that a better way to integrate with it 
would be to only put a single file descriptor into its event loop and 
trigger all other event notification based on that single descriptor. 
This can be done with epoll, where Gtk would watch the epoll descriptor, 
but then Twisted's epoll reactor would deal with actual socket events. 
It might be doable with IOCP reactor too, where a Windows Event is put 
into Gtk and then all of the IOCP operations trigger that one Event. 
It's doable with kqueue in a manner similar to that which applies to 
epoll.  And if all else fails, there's the ThreadedSelectReactor 
approach.

Perhaps Qt's networking support is on par with Twisted's, though, and 
such wouldn't be necessary.  I don't know, as I have very little 
experience with Qt.  I just wanted to mention the idea.
