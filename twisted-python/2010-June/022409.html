If it's an obvious bug, it's worth fixing - but I guess you're asking
about cases that are matters of judgement, or just confusing (e.g. for
2661 I've no idea offhand what IFinishableConsumer is and who implements
it). In which case, probably not worth doing work - you don't want to
end up wasting time on work that has to be redone.

&gt;<i> What if there are several comments with disagreements as to how best

If you feel qualified, make a decision. If you don't, pick someone you
think is and ask them to comment.

&gt;<i> Perhaps these tickets should be put into a separate queue or have a

</I>
Or perhaps another state in our workflow process; all tickets would
start in this state. The state machine would be something like:

discussion -&gt; decided -&gt; coding -&gt; awaiting review -&gt; approved -&gt; closed
                            ^             |
                            |_____________|


You could then know not to start coding on anything still in discussion
state that where you feel someone should make decision. &quot;Decided&quot; state
would imply (1) the issue ought to be fixed and (2) the solution has
been decided on.
