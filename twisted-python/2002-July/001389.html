Ah, my ignorance again -- I hadn't noticed twisted.web.static.File;  
I'll look at that ... we'll be doing at least 3 interfaces that use 
HTTP anyway (web, xmlrpc, and SOAP) ... thanks!

</I>
Yeah, the non-blocking sockets might be a problem ... I'll ask about 
that.  If we do an implementation, we'll at least make an effort to 
make it multi-vendor-supporting.  Our Lisp specialists have used both 
Allegro and Harlequin at various times.  Let us know if other vendor 
or open-source Lisps are of interest, etc.  

Cheers,
