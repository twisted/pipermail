I've heard this comment several times and I don't think I've said much about it
before.  Allow me to wax philosophical for a moment.

One of my favorite things about Twisted is that, due to its origins, it
challenges people to think about what they're doing and whether &quot;work&quot; is
really any harder or more serious than &quot;play&quot;.  It turns out that building
massively multiplayer games - &quot;serious fun&quot; - may be a great deal *more*
difficult than the average &quot;software engineering&quot; project.

If someone is reading this and hasn't been thusly challenged by Twisted or by
something else, maybe they should be ;-).  &quot;The Hacker Ethic&quot; is a great book
on this.

The Twisted framework shows its Python heritage this way, too: Python is a
language designed to teach, and markedly *unlike* Pascal, it is not a stuffy,
academic pedant.  Instead, Python applies its own lessons by making the
practical work of programming easier.  It illuminates the fact that programming
*is* learning: as Perlis said, &quot;If we knew what we were doing, we would not
call it programming.&quot;
