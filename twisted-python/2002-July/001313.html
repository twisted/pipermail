<PRE>Good deal, I did a poor job of communicating my question, but I did 
understand everything.  Some of the processing I was considering doing was 
fairly CPU intensive, but some simple things reduced the processing overhead 
to almost nothing.

So, I can even assume that during processing of a request (I'm not talking 
about data transport here, just the processing) that operations on data 
members in the protocols factory can be considered atomic?  If the server 
can't &quot;process&quot; more than one request at a time, two protocols can not be 
accessing the factory members concurrently, correct?  I've got a mutex 
wrapper around some stuff in my factory right now, but it sounds like I can 
rip that stuff out.

The server I'm writing is pretty simple.  In principle, it's an ftp server 
with special restrictions.  It's a file server with the requirement that it 
provide a pool of unbound files and then a unique path/name to any file that 
has been bound.  I'm going to use it to store and retrieve graphics 
associated with entities in a database for a point of sale/inventory system 
I'm developing.

That way I can be sure that my pathnames will be at most a certain length.  
All directories will be 1 char long and filenames will be 6 chars long.  At a 
depth of 4 with 10 directories spanning from each node, I can store somewhere 
over 10E9 files. 

Thanks for the quick response,

Greg

</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I think you're misunderstanding something ;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Protocol.dataReceived is called only when data is available from a network
</I>&gt;<i> connection; therefore, partial requests coming in are partially parsed and
</I>&gt;<i> buffered by state machines (Protocol instances).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When a full request has been received, the request can be processed.  If
</I>&gt;<i> processing that request requires accessing other asynchronous data that's
</I>&gt;<i> not yet available, that's fine too -- just do your transport.write(...) to
</I>&gt;<i> respond later on, when a different event arrives.  Some parts of the
</I>&gt;<i> framework (twisted.spread, twisted.enterprise) make this extremely
</I>&gt;<i> explicit, by allowing the user to return a Deferred when their response is
</I>&gt;<i> not yet ready.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted can be &quot;processing multiple requests at the same time&quot; in the sense
</I>&gt;<i> that while it's waiting on data from the network, it won't be blocked,
</I>&gt;<i> since all I/O is asynchronous.  It will be &quot;stopped&quot; while doing literal
</I>&gt;<i> CPU-bound &quot;processing&quot; of a request; but while this may seem bad if you
</I>&gt;<i> look at it naively, 90% of all request-processing you'll do is incredibly
</I>&gt;<i> brief, and managing the resources needed to parallelize that processing is
</I>&gt;<i> an order of magnitude (or more, thanks to python's global interpreter lock,
</I>&gt;<i> mutex contention, context switching, and other thread nastinesses) more
</I>&gt;<i> intensive than just running the requests one after another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is before we even start talking about the inherent, dangerous
</I>&gt;<i> complexity of thread-based approaches to state management; they're
</I>&gt;<i> inefficient, and they're often buggy too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even given all that, Twisted does have good support for threads when you
</I>&gt;<i> really need them.

</I>&gt;<i> I hope this answers your questions.  What sort of file server are you
</I>&gt;<i> writing?
