<PRE>I'm working on a network file server right now and am using Twisted as my 
networking framework.  Overall, it's working really well.  The only thing I 
haven't been able to figure out so far is what is async and what is not.  It 
looks like data transfer is async (self.transport.write(msg)), but the 
functions called in the protocol can block the entire twisted main loop.  

Delayed has a note that it is being depreceted, but looked to be the only way 
to make the Protocol dataReceived() function run in an async manner.  What is 
replacing Delayed and is there any other way that I can cause the Protocol 
dataReceived call to handle async?  

The reason I ask is that it doesn't appear that a twisted server can handle 
processing multiple requests at the same time.  It appears that a request 
must come in and be processed before another request can be serviced.  It 
probably isn't a big deal for me as the number of requests and amount of 
processing per request will be low, but it could be that I'm totally 
misunderstanding how the framework works.  

Any insight is appreciated :)
