&gt;<i> twisted.sister is a piece of clustering infrastructure to allow a single
</I>&gt;<i> application or simulation to be distributed across multiple servers on
</I>&gt;<i> multiple hosts.
</I>
... with unit tests that aren't currently passing ;)

&gt;<i> twisted.sister has a concept of a &quot;parent&quot; server ...
</I>
We do need to rename this to the &quot;mother&quot; server sometime soon.

&gt;<i> I implemented a &quot;callDistributed&quot; on the sister server which looks like:
</I>...
&gt;<i> This appears to be inconsistent with the common twisted notion of knowing
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;who&quot; is calling a method for security reasons. Maybe there should be
</I>&gt;<i> another type of remote method called &quot;distributed_&quot; which takes the
</I>&gt;<i> identifying information of the calling distributed object as the first
</I>&gt;<i> arguments:
</I>
Hmm.  I agree with the &quot;distributed_&quot; idea, but I'm not so sure about the
identifying information being presented as such.  This seems like a use case
for &quot;shadow&quot; objects; if you're getting a message from another user, your
sister-server must know _something_ about that user.  In this case, it looks OK
to simply present their resource-ID (which should be the same, as far as we
know, as their username).

I can easily imagine adding to this use-case so that each user has a face-icon
associated with them, or some other immediately displayed information.  On IRC
this mirrors the userhost/nickname pair (immediately visible information) and
the userinfo/whois database (key queryable information).  This is a balance
point which has to be easily tunable for an application.

The other problem with this identifying information is that it's not presented
as part of a path.  My initial attempt at shoehorning twisted.sister into the
callPath paradigm was unfortunate :-)... but having an abstract hierarchy where
resources can be mounted/unmounted seems like a good idea to me, still.

I don't know if callPath is necessarily the best way to do that, though.  It
seems that twisted.web's got the best way of handling that so far; a
formalization of what twisted.web.distrib does would probably be best.  (It
would be really, REALLY nice if we could get twisted.sister clustered web
services for free out of that, somehow)

&gt;<i> where the resourecType and resourceName identify the distributed resource
</I>&gt;<i> that invoked the distributed method call. this distributed_ method would
</I>&gt;<i> only ever be invoked by remote objects managed in a twisted.sister network.
</I>
Maybe sister_... would be a better naming convention, considering its source?

&gt;<i> I thought about adding the location of the distributed caller object also,
</I>&gt;<i> but this information probably isnt required as it is known by the parent who
</I>&gt;<i> can route any further communication. the location could also change if an
</I>&gt;<i> object migrated between sisters which would invalidate any location
</I>&gt;<i> information stored on a sister, so not sending it is a better option.
</I>
Agreed -- routing information has to be handled by the parent.  I take it this
means that messages will also be queued by the parent, in order to avoid losing
them?
