<PRE>Hi again!

&gt;&gt;<i> I can't seem to find a PYTHONPATH anywhere
</I>&gt;<i>PYTHONPATH is an environment variable. If you use a flavor of Windows
</I>&gt;<i>NT, you can set environment variables through a GUI by right-clicking on
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;My Computer&quot;, selecting &quot;Properties&quot;, then selecting the &quot;Adanced&quot; tab,
</I>&gt;<i>and then clicking the &quot;Environment Variables&quot; button (IIRC - this is
</I>&gt;<i>from memory).
</I>
You have a good memory, then. I did do that in the end. An interesting
thing is that it seems this entry hasn't survived a reboot, but that may be
because I put it under &quot;System variables&quot;, instead of &quot;User variables&quot;.
I'll do some testing.

&gt;&gt;<i> you may want to skip this and simply get the Windows Installer version
</I>of
&gt;&gt;<i> Twisted from the download page.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>Terribly sorry about this: I don't think there have been any .exe-style
</I>&gt;<i>installers for a few versions.
</I>
Not to worry, setup.py must have done some good. I'm currently testing
different things for my next &quot;chapter&quot;, but so far there's nothing to
complain about.

&gt;<i>finding people to consistently delegate stuff like this to for new
</I>&gt;<i>releases (My release procedure is involved enough, and I'm lazy enough,
</I>&gt;<i>that I don't really want to add this extra work to it). So if anyone's
</I>&gt;<i>willing to consistently do this, I'd greatly appreciate it. :-)
</I>
I would like to, but can't promise much consistency I'm afraid.

&gt;&gt;<i> again, then running another full test led to another failure removed.
</I>&gt;<i>Ok, this is a known issue with threading on Win32.
</I>
Oh well. I wonder what they did to make things like MTS work with high
loads then? I'll keep the problem in mind though, and make some notes if I
stumble into useful information about this issue.

&gt;<i>Anyway, it probably doesn't matter unless you need to use threading on
</I>&gt;<i>Win32. (Can someone else comment on this?)
</I>
A registry monitor I once tried to make, failed to work as intended because
of lack of threading support (in VB). Probably very easy to do in C though.
But doing things async (like in Medusa) should still work, right?
 
&gt;&gt;<i> Still, I have had some of Twisted running! There's hope.
</I>&gt;<i>Thank you for the email! It's great to hear from newbies, especially
</I>&gt;<i>when they describe the pains and bugs that they've found in our
</I>&gt;<i>software. Hopefully by 1.0 Twisted will have a nice installation
</I>&gt;<i>experience on all platforms. :-)
</I>
If I can help in some small way with that, I'd be thrilled.

Nils
