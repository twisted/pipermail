It's simple:

1. Get everyone to use it.
2. ???
3. MONEY!

Thanks - can we ask you for a quote for our 1.0 press release?

</I>&gt;<i> Has anybody else thought about using Twisted in a unit or functional

Well, if the Twisted server is in the same process (you can run it in a 
different thread) you have two alternatives:

reactor.listenTCP(8025, myFactory)
# we don't call reactor.run() here, instead we do
while testIsntDone:
     reactor.iterate() # do a single iteration of the event loop

Or:

reactor.listenTCP(8025, myFactory)
reactor.run()
# when test is done it can call reactor.crash() to stop the event loop,
# which unlike reactor.stop() still allows us to run() again


In both cases you can use reactor.callLater() for a timoeut. We do both in 
our unit tests (twisted.test) package, so you can find some examples there.

If you want to run Twisted in a different process, you may want to look at 
how admin/accepttests does it. Basically you make a python script that has a 
twisted.internet.app.Application instance called &quot;application&quot; at module 
level, use the twistd command to run it (twistd -y myscript.py), and then 
&quot;kill `cat twistd.pid`&quot; to shutdown the server. If you want to communicate 
with it while its running xml-rpc would probably work nicely 
(twisted.web.xmlrpc and see the example in doc/examples/).
