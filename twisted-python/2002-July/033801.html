Nothing reliable.  I was just testing with doc/examples/pbbenchserver.py 
and pbbenchclient.py and looking at how many calls/second were being made.

This week, I'm planning on putting together a quick Banana bench and 
then I'll be able to test it directly and with more predictable loads to 
exercise the parts that I'm changing. :)

That'll let me get reliable and useful numbers and do some targeted 
profiling as well I hope.

Those fixes were just things that I'd noticed when reading through the 
source.

Yep.  I was originally unaware of what they were in Python. :)  Still 
learning...
