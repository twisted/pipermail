Mr. Virtanen is right. The reason you might think it's async is that most File
I/O operations in Twisted are performed in a response to some request (web,
ftp), and are treated as &quot;large file&quot; operations.  The file is read one 'chunk'
at a time, and more is only read when the network connection it's being written
to becomes available for writing again.  This is what the &quot;producer/consumer&quot;
API in twisted.internet is for.  In general, on linux, this will mean that your
data is available in most cases anyway, due to the speed difference between
network &amp; file I/O.  In the cases where it's not, it's likely that your server
is under high enough load that it's OK to block for an ms or two to wait for
the data.

Asyncore has a great little comment about this:

# After a little research (reading man pages on various unixen, and
# digging through the linux kernel), I've determined that select()
# isn't meant for doing doing asynchronous file i/o.
# Heartening, though - reading linux/mm/filemap.c shows that linux
# supports asynchronous read-ahead.  So _MOST_ of the time, the data
# will be sitting in memory for us already when we go to read it.

Hope this is enlightening.
