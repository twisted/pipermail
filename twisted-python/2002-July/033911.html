Yes, both of these are important considerations for our app.  

&gt;<i> This is also a decent basis for &quot;file transfer&quot; between two objects, since
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;very large string, stored on disk&quot; is a degenerate case of &quot;very large object,

Great -- I'll take a look at that.  Thanks!

</I>
Understood.  Since we have limited manpower for our Lisp work, we tend 
to value the power of commercial development tools, but we do care 
about portability, so we try to adhere to ANSI CL -- see:
<A HREF="http://exp-engine.sourceforge.net/lisp.html">http://exp-engine.sourceforge.net/lisp.html</A>
(And it is *very* important that there are no *run-time* license fees!
Anyone can download our stuff and run it.)

Express Engine, our Lisp project, is somewhat esoteric, so even though 
it's on SF no other developers have joined. ;^)  If anyone is curious, 
see:  <A HREF="http://exp-engine.sourceforge.net">http://exp-engine.sourceforge.net</A> 

Express Engine encapsulates some very important functions for our app, 
enabling us to munge data produced by various CAD/CAE/CAM (&quot;CAX&quot;) 
tools, for which the most widely implemented exchange standard is 
ISO 10303 (STEP).  Express Engine encapsulates our STEP data I/O and 
mapping functionality.  (Like I said, somewhat esoteric! :^)  As you 
can imagine, STEP files produced by CAX tools can be quite huge.  

This also hints at why Twisted is such a natural fit for our app:  a 
multi-player networked game environment is not all that different 
from a massive collaborative engineering environment ... at the 
infrastructure level, essentially identical.

Cheers,
-- Steve.
