<PRE>We are very happy to announce the release of version 0.75 of MV3D! This was mainly a bug-fixing release with more than 65 bugs squashed. Also, in this release, MV3D gained support for Linux with the Ogre3D renderer along with Mac OS X with the Panda3D renderer. This means that MV3D's client, server, and tools are available on Windows, Linux, and OS X! With bug-fixes across the whole platform, this is also the most stable release of MV3D to date.

MV3D is an open source multiplayer game and virtual world framework written in Python using Twisted for networking. It encompasses a scalable server with dynamic load balancing, a robust set of content creation tools, and an extensible 3D client application. MV3D provides the foundation to build anything from 3D chat rooms to full MMORPGs with the goal of letting you concentrate on creating a unique virtual world instead of the infrastructure to support it.

For more information on MV3D and this or future releases, please visit the website at <A HREF="http://www.mv3d.com">http://www.mv3d.com</A> . The full release notes for version 0.75 are available online at this URL: <A HREF="http://www.mv3d.com/trac/browser/tags/mv3d-0.75/release-notes.txt">http://www.mv3d.com/trac/browser/tags/mv3d-0.75/release-notes.txt</A> . For further inquiries, feel free to stop by our IRC channel on irc.freenode.net #MV3D.

Here are some screenshots of MV3D running on OS X and Linux:

<A HREF="http://www.mv3d.com/trac/screenshots/52">http://www.mv3d.com/trac/screenshots/52</A>

The next release is 0.80 which is set to include features aimed at improving MV3D's usability as a platform for traditional MMORPGs such as instancing along with increasing tool usability and functionality.

Enjoy,

Mike
