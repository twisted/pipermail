Well, actually no... On bsd, the /dev/* files are statically created. So as it
is now, it picks the 64 existing /dev/fd/* files, which is not correct
since higher
fd with a higher number will never be found. This is getting tricky. So if one
can't trust /dev/fd/ on some platform, maybe it should not be tried at all,
or we need to find a way to know at runtime/configure time if this is safe...

&gt;&gt;<i> Of course this means trying all fds as last resort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on platforms that don't provide a simpler way to do it. &#160;Doing it there or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing it by ignoring EBADF on close() later would be the same, as far as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;suboptimization&quot; is concerned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, and this is just what should happen on OpenBSD now.
</I>
Except for the problem above.

&gt;<i> Hopefully these are already marked as CLOEXEC, or lots of people would
</I>&gt;<i> already be having lots of problems with them. &#160;Despite that, they should be
</I>&gt;<i> closed by `reactor.spawnProcess` (because that doesn't hurt and it's simpler
</I>&gt;<i> than checking for CLOEXEC). &#160;Then the only problem is that they are
</I>&gt;<i> recreated in the child process and mess up the test's assumptions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps another approach to testing this function would be to create a file
</I>&gt;<i> descriptor and assert that:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- That file descriptor is not open in the child process
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;- stdin, stdout, and sterr are open in the child process
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Only, without some care, one of the pthread pipe fds might end up looking
</I>&gt;<i> like the probe descriptor, so maybe that can't really work.
</I>
That is closer to what the test is really about : spawnProcess don't leave
an undesired fd opened.

&gt;<i> closefrom() doesn't appear to help. &#160;Descriptors intended to be kept open
</I>&gt;<i> may be mixed together with descriptors which must be closed. &#160;This is
</I>&gt;<i> because of the `childFDs` parameter to `reactor.spawnProcess`, which allows
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary file descriptors to be passed to the child.
</I>
Right, I overlooked that.

Oh, I have just thought of another way to test all opened fds in just
one syscall.
It goes like this:

import resource
import select

_poll = [ 0, None ]

def listOpenFDs():
        maxfd = resource.getrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_NOFILE)[0]
        if maxfd != _poll[0]:
                _poll[0] = maxfd
                _poll[1] = select.poll()
                for fd in xrange(maxfd):
                        _poll[1].register(fd)
        return [ d for (d, r) in _poll[1].poll() if r != select.POLLNVAL ]
