I do despise the unittest (and hence trial) camelcaseness. I don't know
enough low level python to be able to answer whether a test() function would
have the same drawback as assert, if -O testing is really an issue.

There is a use case for this, though. py.test has a -x option that will stop
executing after one test returns an error. This is very much a time saver
when you're running a bunch of lengthy tests on a function where one initial
test failing may inevitably mean that a bunch of more sophisticated tests
involving the same item will fail. If I can predictably say that test_x will
always run before test_advanced_x, then I can try to fix the simple version
before doing a lengthy test on the advanced version.

One thing that I did like out of py.test was the ability to name a test or
test object that you wanted to run and it would do magic pattern matching on
the test's __name__ based on what you typed in. It still printed out
non-matching tests as skipped, but it only ran what you wanted. It allows
you to, again, focus on small functionality within a larger test file.

&gt;&gt;<i>4. setup_module / setup_class / setup_method.  Handy for reusing

</I>
trial.unittest.setUp was changed to work after 2.0 was released on windows,
as I needed to upgrade to twisted svn to get it working.
