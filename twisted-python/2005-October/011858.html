It does seem to be the case, yes.

Great :-) Can I quote you on that? :-D

Seriously though, I did kinda expect that. I suspect the two different ways
of writing code will be easier to different sorts of people. Personally I find
the approach natural and normal. You can take any implication you like
from that ;-)

&gt;<i> It was enough like Erlang that it would only make things easy for experts,

Interesting viewpoint. KInda at odds with what we've seen so far, but then we 
haven't had a large community react to it yet, there's also the caveat above 
of it might be a mindset thing rather than skill level this, and mainly at 
the moment I don't think it's ready for a large community yet* - if one's 
appropriate (We're still in the process of finding the best way of writing 
systems using it).
   * We're not in a rush

FWIW, it's more inspired by things which /aren't/ Erlang. I've not written 
anything in Erlang :)

If it turns out though that you're right - only makes things easy for
experts - then the project's failed (which won't be a problem, that's
the point of research to try things and see what works/doesn't, just
means I have to try again). As a result I hope you're wrong (for
once :).

Thanks for the feedback!

Best Regards,


Michael.
