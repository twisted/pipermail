It would also probably simplify the existing setup.py installations, but
agreed: let's not conflate the two discussions.

However, as long as we're talking about it... mg: What you did for Nevow
would probably be a good idea; let's have a parallel setuptools_setup.py
for a while before switching over to it.

eggs are pretty awesome though, twisted.plugin should definitely have
some way of integrating with them.  As far as dropin.cache goes, I have
some weird ideas about a &quot;path management object&quot; that wrapped around
sys.path and did things like determine if zipimport was being used at
any point in any path, to give parallel directories to write cache data
to, etc.  __file__ references can be replaced by
get_resource_mumblemumble calls entirely, right?

FWIW: I do mostly remember arguing against this initially ;-), and I
think it was probably a good idea at the time.  The &quot;topfiles&quot; idea was
pretty ingenious to keep the whole repository working with the same
structure between 1.3 and 2.0.  I just think its' time has passed.

and David, I did read the code to Pthy before I wrote Combinator, so
that project did help :-)
