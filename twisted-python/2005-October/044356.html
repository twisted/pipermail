#&gt;#&gt;&gt; I want to encapsulate deferreds into a function that looks like
#&gt;#&gt;&gt; synchronous when invoked.
#&gt;#&gt;
#&gt;#&gt;
#&gt;
#&gt;
#&gt;I use a similar mechanism in my database wrapper module.
#&gt;
#&gt;here is an example of it in use:

# the OP wanted a function that looks synchronous when *invoked* - the
# example you gave doesn't look synchronous to the caller at all - the

The origional question was:
&quot;&quot;&quot; So, how can I write mySyncFunc() so that at the end I print the result
of someCalculation() and not just 0? &quot;&quot;&quot;

My example and proposed solution does that. And as such is usable by him.

# functions decorated with &quot;genAside&quot; return deferreds.  it's easy to
# pretend that they don't, if you decorate all of your functions similarly,
# but at some point some plain, upstream  function is going to have to deal
# directly with a deferred (this is not the case with the example because it
# is a script, and nothing actually depends on the result of doit()).  also,
# if any operation inside the doit() function raises an exception, the
# reactor will not stop.  something like this would probably be better:
#
# doit().addErrback(log.err).addCallback(lambda ignore: reactor.stop())
#

it is an example usage, not a real world implementation, of course if
something fails it will die.

# i'd like to reiterate glyph's advice that suggesting generator based
# short-cuts to twisted beginners is not a good idea.  it's *very* easy to
# use these things without understanding what is actually going on under the
# hood, and massive confusion frequently arises as soon as something crops
# up that doesn't fit into that programming style.
#

Why do i hit this wall constantly when discussing twisted usage with
twisted users or developers mostly on freenode's #twisted admitedly:
Telling someone NOT to do something is not answering a question it is
avoiding it.

I pasted the url for the full source so that he could &quot;look under the
hood&quot; if he feels uncomfortable with it's mechanism he needent use it.  By
your reasoning surely he should go through the entire twisted codebase
aswell and know exactly what a deffered is doing &quot;under the hood&quot; and how
twisted does it's asyncronousity before using it ?
