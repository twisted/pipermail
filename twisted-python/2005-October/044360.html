</I>
It's not so much that &quot;K&quot; is doing something dumb (for reference: we are not talking about the successor to J, which is itself a successor to APL).  With a project like &quot;K&quot;, there would be as much focus on explaining correct usage of generators as there is in Twisted focusing on correct usage of Deferreds.  It would be hard to write a program using &quot;K&quot; and not understand the ramifications of what you're doing.

&gt;<i>I suppose one risk point of our approach is that by trying to make it easier
</I>&gt;<i>to work with we risk people thinking concurrency is naturally is easy (which
</I>&gt;<i>is potentially quite a dangerous meme, since software concurrency isn't
</I>&gt;<i>naturally easy). BTW, FWIW, I read the blog post you pointed at earlier in
</I>&gt;<i>the thread and agree with it).
</I>
I looked at &quot;K&quot;.  Reading code in it was powerfully weird - and this is coming from the author of Twisted ;-). It was enough like Erlang that it would only make things easy for experts, so I don't think that it would lead to this problem - on the other hand, I haven't seen how large communities react to it.

&gt;<i>I'll say one thing though, hopefully the original poster realises how much
</I>&gt;<i>they have to do to make their code safe when they're faking synchronous
</I>&gt;<i>behaviour and faking a single process look. If they don't then as everyone
</I>&gt;<i>has said, they're setting themselves up for a world of pain.
</I>
I have a lot of experience dealing with people that ask questions in the form that the poster did.  As a rule they don't have any idea how hard solving concurrency problems is, and have been lead to believe (by Java or whatever) that concurrency is easy, just a matter of running 2 or more &quot;simple&quot; synchronous (-looking) programs at a time.  While I don't know the OP personally, I am willing to risk their taking offense, so that I can continue to drive home the point to hordes of fledgeling developers out there that seem to desperately want to believe that massively concurrent programming is easy.
