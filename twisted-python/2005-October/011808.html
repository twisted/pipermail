I believe I've lodged a disagreement with you before about this.  If you really think it's best I'll trust your judgement more than mine, since you're certainly doing a bang-up job getting trial into useful shape, but I'll still try to convince you :).

The reactor should be started by the command-line tool and stopped after all tests are done.  Several reasons why:

 - Tests should be runnable by &quot;live&quot; processes.  *twisted* context should need to be around, not unittest context, for the tests to run properly.  This would help a lot in situations where something seems to work for the test framework but doesn't on a live server.

 - We try, but some event loops really *can't* be stopped and restarted safely or reliably multiple times within the same process.  Previous discussions on this list I believe called out cfreactor as an example.  I believe there are others.

 - Normal execution of Twisted programs has the Reactor start up once, lots of stuff run in it, and then it shuts down.  I don't mind exercising the edge cases, but this _only_ excercises the edge cases; the reactor starts up and shuts down every time something new happens.

&gt;<i>The advantages definitely include reduced duplication and less code to
</I>&gt;<i>maintain.  But another big advantage is that (when we're ready) Trial
</I>&gt;<i>can use third-party extensions of unittest straight out of the box.
</I>
Are there any such third-party extensions which have value?
