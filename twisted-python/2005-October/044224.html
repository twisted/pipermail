There have always been people who don't want to use &quot;large&quot; frameworks
because they are &quot;too big&quot;, which is to say involve having a few more MB
used on disk. This was part of the motivation for splitting up Twisted:
marketing.

pyevent: much lower level than Twisted, so requires a lot more work on
developer's part (Twisted also provides such a low level interface
though in additional to e.g. the nice high level TCP abstraction with
buffering and so on).
EventNet: requires Twisted apparently :)
kamaelia: an experimental platform for what I hear are some interesting
ideas we should look at; probably would be a good candidate for running
on top of Twisted since they seem to deal with higher levels of
abstraction mostly.

</I>
Not as far as I can tell. E.g. zope3, which had their own event loop,
just switched to Twisted
