Nope.  A test() function could do all the same stack introspection and everything as assert, but would not create problems with -O.  So it's a stealable idea.

The correct way to deal with this is to print errors immediately when they happen, like trial -e, or to run just the test that you want, like twisted-dev.el does.  If your unit test spits out the error right away, you can fix it while the rest of the tests are running, then kill and restart them immediately, for maximum user/computer parallelism.

&gt;<i>One thing that I did like out of py.test was the ability to name a test or
</I>&gt;<i>test object that you wanted to run and it would do magic pattern matching on
</I>&gt;<i>the test's __name__ based on what you typed in. It still printed out
</I>&gt;<i>non-matching tests as skipped, but it only ran what you wanted. It allows
</I>&gt;<i>you to, again, focus on small functionality within a larger test file.
</I>
Hmm, wildcards might be handy, but in practice I've never wanted more than trial's hierarchical naming.  One thing I wish trial had was a reporter mode that looked like 'make' output, eg:

% trial --gcc -e foo
trial --gcc -e foo.test
trial --gcc -e foo.test.test_whatever
trial --gcc -e foo.test.test_whatever.TestWhatever.test1
    OK
trial --gcc -e foo.test.test_whatever.TestWhatever.test2
    OK
trial --gcc -e foo.test.test_whatever.TestWhatever.test3
    FAILED: FooError
foo/bar.py:1: ...

so I could easily jump to a failed test, then copy the exact trial line needed to run it, so that I could paste that into my buffer's test line, or run trial manually on the command line to 'zoom in' to the test or suite I want.

I bet mumak has cleaned up the reporter API so this is now sane to do, I should have a look.
