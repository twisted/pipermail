I was recommending leaving it alone in slightly-broken state.

</I>
This also still be broken even if we keep semi-broken filename  
support, unless we also ensure that all of twisted's tests can be run  
without being imported under their proper module name. Sigh.

A possibly better alternative is to write a bit of Twisted-specific  
code for the buildbot quickbuilder to do the backwards translation  
from filename-&gt;modulename. That is not very hard (delete &quot;$project/&quot;  
prefix, '.py' suffix, replace '/' with '.'), but it is twisted-repo- 
layout-specific, so it can't really be reasonably done in trial itself.

Yes, I was thinking about that as well, and it looks like we should  
be able to modify the new recursive code to work inside a zipfile  
(and other setuptools-compatible-loaders). It provides replacement  
listdir, isdir, and exists functions, which is all that this code needs.
