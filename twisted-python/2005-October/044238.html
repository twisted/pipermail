</I>
 - twisted.python.log is OLDER than the Python-provided one.  Ask instead, &quot;why does Python use a custom logging module instead of the Twisted-provided one?&quot;

 - as a matter of fact, this design choice *IS* documented, <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/issue307">http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/issue307</A>

 - okay okay, you have a point, there should be documents put together somewhere, not just random things in the issue tracker :).  I thought it was amusing that you picked the _one_ design choice as an example of this that _does_ have copious documentation available somewhere public.

&gt;<i>- the tendency to advocate proprietary protocols (like PB) without
</I>&gt;<i>warning the user should be mitigated
</I>
&quot;custom&quot;, maybe.  &quot;proprietary&quot;?  no, not according to any definition of the word.  There is a Java implementation, at least half of an Emacs implementation.

PB2 is probably going to take a while to get implemented everywhere, but there is at least some effort towards making this protocol more widely available than just Python + Twisted.

&gt;<i>- the architecture is sometimes bizarre or badly described (the
</I>&gt;<i>credential stuff looks like Chinese to me); for example, why is there a
</I>&gt;<i>distinction between &quot;*Protocol&quot; and &quot;*Factory&quot; types?
</I>
I'm not sure I understand the question here.  Have you read the writing-servers and writing-clients documentation?

&gt;<i>I often recommend the use of Twisted for standard network functions. But
</I>&gt;<i>I stay away of the more sophisticated stuff (including twistd, PB,
</I>&gt;<i>Nevow, etc.). Grouping all this stuff together with the basic, trusted,
</I>&gt;<i>dependable network classes may yield a perception of twisted as
</I>&gt;<i>bloatware.
</I>
That's exactly why the project was split up.  Not only is Nevow not distributed with Twisted, we recently had a discussion on this very mailing list explaining why it is *NEVER* allowed to even *optionally* import Nevow from the Twisted codebase...
