Perhaps I was overly harsh then.  I realized that you understood the problem - I was framing it there for context, meaining to say that you could be a more direct participant in the solution, not that you were a jackass for even mentioning that there was a bug in Twisted that needed to be fixed :-).

&gt;&gt;<i> My specific suggestion to you would be to start contributing patches
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against the automated build/release scripts so that all a Twisted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> release manager has to do when the release is ready is &quot;release-twisted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> --core 2.5.2 'This release fixes several issues in tsreactor spotted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the previous release'&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Right now I see five bugs tagged with &quot;release management&quot;. I'll have a
</I>&gt;<i>proper look at them later and see what I can do. I suspect, though, that
</I>&gt;<i>much of it will require me to know the build system inside out. Is it

</I>
radix, apparently, and .au times.  Last I heard out of him before this thread, he wasn't doing it any more, but I guess we've got him hooked at least through 2.1!  Perhaps I just need to agitate for a more rapid release; there's clearly lots of forward movement in core that needs to get out there.

&gt;&gt;<i> Once this is fixed then the procedural
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems of doing a release should be quite a bit easier to deal with.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Speaking of which, I don't even think we *have* a release manager now,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to volunteer for that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What's involved? Can someone with less-than-stellar knowledge of the
</I>&gt;<i>intricacies of twisted, and an unbelievebaly small understanding of C, do
</I>&gt;<i>the job?
</I>
That sounds about right.  None of the work of an RM is hard - you just have to basically pay attention to what's going on and coordinate, and do the tedious typing-into-fields on freshmeat and the website and whatever.  Whether he's still doing it or not, radix needs a break, so my suggestion stands :).

&gt;&gt;<i> Twisted *SHOULD* be a working,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> self-contained whole.
</I>
&gt;<i>I agree, wholeheartedly.
</I>
Awesome.
