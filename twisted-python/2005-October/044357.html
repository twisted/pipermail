&gt;<i>The origional question was:

no, it really doesn't.  here is the code snippet given by the original poster:

def mySyncFunc()
   x = 0
   def done(data):
      global x
      x = data

   d = someCalculation()
   d.addCallback(done)
   &lt;something here to hold until &quot;done&quot; is really done&gt;
   return x

the desired functionality is &quot;at the end i print the result of someCalculation() and not just 0&quot;.  this could obviously be done by changing the first line of done() to &quot;print data&quot;.  but the &quot;return x&quot; betrays the intention that the function would ideally return the value of &quot;x&quot; (returning the _value_ of &quot;x&quot; is worlds away from returning a deferred that fires with the value of &quot;x&quot;).  no defgen type solution is going to make this possible

&gt;<i>Why do i hit this wall constantly when discussing twisted usage with
</I>&gt;<i>twisted users or developers mostly on freenode's #twisted admitedly:
</I>&gt;<i>Telling someone NOT to do something is not answering a question it is
</I>&gt;<i>avoiding it.
</I>
the point here is that this particular question does not have a satisfying answer.  it has been beaten to death recently that you cannot magically expose a synchronous interface to asynchronous code.  so, in summary, the question was answered, by several people in this thread, and the answer is &quot;you cannot do that and expect your code to work reliably&quot;.  is that not a valid answer?

&gt;<i>I pasted the url for the full source so that he could &quot;look under the
</I>&gt;<i>hood&quot; if he feels uncomfortable with it's mechanism he needent use it.  By
</I>&gt;<i>your reasoning surely he should go through the entire twisted codebase
</I>&gt;<i>aswell and know exactly what a deffered is doing &quot;under the hood&quot; and how
</I>&gt;<i>twisted does it's asyncronousity before using it ?
</I>
ideally yes.  somebody unfamiliar with deferreds is going to be in no position to determine whether or not they are comfortable with a generator based mechanism for handling them.  people already associate unfair amounts of magic with twisted, and i dont think suggesting such abstract interfaces to beginners is an effective way to mitigate this.
