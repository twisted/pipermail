This was the sentence I was hoping to avoid. It is a very common, and highly
merited complaint which I am very well aware of. I didn't want to appear
like just another whiny user who couldn't care less about the people behind
the project. I guess I did fail.

&gt;<i> My specific suggestion to you would be to start contributing patches
</I>&gt;<i> against the automated build/release scripts so that all a Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> release manager has to do when the release is ready is &quot;release-twisted
</I>&gt;<i> --core 2.5.2 'This release fixes several issues in tsreactor spotted
</I>&gt;<i> with the previous release'&quot;. 
</I>
Right now I see five bugs tagged with &quot;release management&quot;. I'll have a
proper look at them later and see what I can do. I suspect, though, that
much of it will require me to know the build system inside out. Is it
documented anywhre? Or who can I talk to about working out how it works and
what sort of times does he or she tend to be online?

&gt;<i> Once this is fixed then the procedural
</I>&gt;<i> problems of doing a release should be quite a bit easier to deal with. 
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking of which, I don't even think we *have* a release manager now,
</I>&gt;<i> want to volunteer for that?
</I>
What's involved? Can someone with less-than-stellar knowledge of the
intricacies of twisted, and an unbelievebaly small understanding of C, do
the job?

&gt;<i> I suggest this rather than your other recommendations as to breaking out
</I>&gt;<i> a separate tsreactor release because Twisted *SHOULD* be a working,
</I>&gt;<i> self-contained whole.  Right now there are lots of holes and lots of
</I>&gt;<i> bugs, but we shouldn't distribute separate &quot;backports&quot; of every fix and
</I>&gt;<i> additional component because making a release is hard.  We should make
</I>&gt;<i> making a release easier and just do that more often.
</I>
I agree, wholeheartedly.
