<PRE>Thanks for the response. I was thinking Pyro and PP might be
incompatible with Twisted, since they already have communication
mechanisms in them, but wasn't sure. I've also got a response from Ed
that he might try to get some sample code up on the AsynCluster site to
show how something like this could be implemented. I've got to better
define my goals and design and perhaps post that.

Again, thanks for the response,
Doug

PB (i.e. twisted.spread.pb) might be appropriate to this sort of work. 
It makes communicating between objects in multiple Twisted processes 
fairly easy.

Depending on your requirements, so might a lot of Twisted things.  If 
other code is talking to this, AMP (twisted.protocols.amp) or XMLRPC 
(twisted.web.xmlrpc) might also be appropriate.

Pyro and PP, while potentially valid approaches to your problem, are 
more or less incompatible with Twisted.  They *could* be made to work 
togther, there's no actual technical incompatibility, but they're geared

towards working with entirely different programming paradigms.

When it's all said and done, none of these things is really a turn-key 
distributed programming environment.  They're just different ways to 
communicate messages between nodes.  In order to say what would be most 
appropriate to your problem domain, you'd need to describe your 
environment and your requirements a bit better.  For obvious reasons, 
though, you're not likely to get a suggestion other than &quot;use Twisted&quot; 
in this particular venue :).

It sounds like Ed's AsynCluster might provide the sort of structure (on 
top of PB) that you're looking for, but I don't know much about it, and 
I've never used it.  However, unlike these other tools, it's not just a 
messaging system, it is specifically for doing cluster computing.
