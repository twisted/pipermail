<PRE>Many thanks to all for the helpful responses. They've given me a lot
of options to think about. I'll see where it takes me.

Some specific comments:

Thanks, that was useful.

&gt;<i>It might make a good example to work from.  Note that any call that

</I>&gt;<i>no other threaded tasks will ever be able to complete.
</I>
That's a good point. My initial thought was that I'm not writing a
long-running process here (my process runs all the threads, does a bit
of housekeeping when they complete, and then stops) and the blocking
thread condition is rare, so it shouldn't be a problem. But that's
just swapping one rare problem for another, somewhat rarer case. So
maybe I'm better fixing it properly.

</I>
Ah. That clarifies why setTimeout is deprecated, and why it's not
appropriate for me. Thanks!

Sadly, no. It's a horribly broken API in this respect. (It's the
Oracle database connection API, if you want to know - no timeout
capability, and a rare but definite chance of a complete hang, no
return *ever*).

&gt;<i>Oh -- and remember that while you can't kill threads, you *can* kill processes.
</I>&gt;<i>Consider using subprocesses to do your blocking work.
</I>
That's possible, but I'm running on Windows and subprocess management
is not as manageable on that platform (even under Python/twisted). But
it is a thought, and I'll keep it in mind.

Paul.
