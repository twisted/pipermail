Thanks Colin, this would actually work fine for what I need to do. I  
just figured that I was doing something wrong since it's mentioned in  
a few places that Twisted should be able to do this. Perhaps I am  
mistaking Copyable with Referenceable however... The example from the  
docs I was thinking of where an object is send on a round trip then  
compared using '==' is actually a pb.Referenceable (I think Copyable  
is a subclass though)?

Anyway, your solution should work and I might use that for the time  
being. All objects that could possibly go out to clients and come  
back again should be stored in the ZODB, so I might be able to use  
whatever ID it uses, or generate one myself otherwise.

If anyone knows the &quot;Twisted Way&quot; do deal with several clients  
sharing lists of objects (or even just complex objects that refer to  
other objects) please let me know.

Thanks all for the fast responses!
