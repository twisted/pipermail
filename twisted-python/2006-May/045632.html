<PRE>Nicola Larosa:
&gt;&gt;<i> In my experience, sending big files over PB takes way too much time. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is due to the serialization-deserialization process involved. Paging avoids
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> blocking, which is good, but it still takes much more than sending the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files as-is.
</I>
Justin Mazzola Paluska:
&gt;<i> How bad is the slow down?  Or, to ask the question another way, how
</I>&gt;<i> much CPU will the process actually take?  
</I>
100% CPU for all the time it takes. Serialization is CPU- and memory-intensive.


&gt;&gt;<i> You could send the files over an HTTP connection, avoiding the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> serialization overhead. Setting up HTTP clients and servers is very easy in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Twisted, as you surely know.
</I>
&gt;<i> Indeed! Using HTTP is appealing because it is closer to just stuffing
</I>&gt;<i> bits in a socket from an efficiency standpoint.  Is there a way of
</I>&gt;<i> passing a RemoteReference to an HTTP server?
</I>
I don't think so. There's no overlapping that I know of, between PB and HTTP.


&gt;<i> Or is the best thing to do just use the PB to send a URL to the DEST
</I>&gt;<i> server?
</I>
That's what I was hinting at, yes. Of course you should separately take
care of any required authentication, authorization and encryption on the
HTTP connection.
