Fair enough.

&gt;<i>The thought of using the existing reactor for communication and serving has

</I>
Despite the fact that I don't have a similar use-case on a real server or client, it's also interesting to me.  It would definitely make certain test-cases easier to write, and easier testing == more tests.  :)

I previously suggested that perhaps you could write tests for that patch, to verify that multiple reactors could actually run simultaneously.  That was a serious suggestion: if you'd like Twisted to support this feature, you can almost certainly get it accepted if there are accompanying test cases.  I'll commit to doing the reviews if you submit the patches.
