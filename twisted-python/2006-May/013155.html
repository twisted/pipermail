Well, I was a contributor to Lore in ages past and was one of the ones who
thought it was a great idea.  Now I'm in the other camp, and I actually have
been using reST for all kinds of documentation on my end.  It's just so much
more convenient to type.

I'm not opposed to saving my documents as HTML-like syntax, but I hate typing
angle brackets.  After trying out many different approaches, I have decided
that my primary requirement in a documentation system is that it be easy to
type in documentation.  That, and nothing else, keeps me updating my
documentation regularly.  That and nothing else would convince me to generate
more documentation where it's missing.

I might be dissuaded if I saw that there was excellent tool support for Lore
out there.  What tools do people use to write Lore documents? Nvu?  How do you
handle doing the special lore-specific markup like Python code snippets?

- From what I remember about Lore, it doesn't do anything reST can't do; more
than that, reST can be converted to Lore without a lot of work.  (Round-trip
should even be possible, if that was for some reason desirable.)  So the
bottom line is: It's all about editor preference.  I would happily use Nvu if
I knew that the output would be Lore without any extra fiddling.
