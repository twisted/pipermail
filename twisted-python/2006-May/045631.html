How bad is the slow down?  Or, to ask the question another way, how
much CPU will the process actually take?  

I ask because the machines in question are being used as file servers
for streaming applications like video and whatnot, so having Twisted
suck up all of the CPU may disrupt the other streams.  (We're not
using Twisted to actually serve the files, but rather as the
application framework for various web- and GUI- based management
clients.  The copy data feature would be the first time we're moving
lots of data with Twisted.)

</I>
Indeed! Using HTTP is appealing because it is closer to just stuffing
bits in a socket from an efficiency standpoint.  Is there a way of
passing a RemoteReference to an HTTP server?  Or is the best thing to
do just use the PB to send a URL to the DEST server?
