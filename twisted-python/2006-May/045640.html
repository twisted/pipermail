<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>I started using web2 in production about 4 months ago and it's stable
(there were bugs but I've fixed them all). Grepping for 'grep -ri nevow'
over my tree shows zero hits for about two months. The web2 API
rightfully isn't stable but people that is ok with slight change of APIs
(changes that hopefully won't require a total rewrite of the
application) should be allowed to start porting their apps to web2, and
infact in the last 4 months the API has not changed singificantly, and
it seems quite mature, much better than web1.

It is now time to make web2 mainstream, implementing any potentially
missing feature (I never tested the web2 client side for example, that
may not be mature as the server side yet) and leave for web3
any huge changes that isn't strictly necessary and that would requires a
total rewrite of the apps. Twisted-web userbase shouldn't lose more time
on the obsolete twisted.web1 api. There is people like me that needs
something with much more scalable and simpler to code with than
web1+neovw. twisted.web2 + cheetah (or other rendering templates) fills
this gap nicely. I hope that the huge nevow dependency of divmod
products generates no conflict of interest with change. Web2 always gest
installed in Twisted-HG (including all web2 fixes that are pending and
that I'll post to twisted-web list shortly).
