Righto. How do you know it's a valid bugfix without a test? Personally,
I know that I make mistakes from time to time, so I think it's handy to
have something that will independantly verify if I've made one or not.
Many a time I've thought I knew what was broken only to find out it was
something completely different.

The twisted folks appear to disagree with you about the necessity of
writing a unit test as part of the bugfix integration process. Since
it's their code, they get to make the rules.

&gt;<i> &gt; Incidentally, those with slightly more CS knowledge know that it is

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I mean is that a test suite cannot prove the code is bug free. Nor
</I>&gt;<i> that any bugfix is correct. If nothing else because the test suite may
</I>&gt;<i> be buggy too. This is obvious.
</I>
Obvious to you and me, perhaps, but there may be others who read this to
whom it isn't so obvious. Hopefully they find this thread helpful.

&gt;<i> Clearly a test suite is welcome and can only help, but its mandatory
</I>&gt;<i> requirement for any change to the code sounds way excessive.
</I>
I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on this point. I support
the mandatory unit test requirement.

&gt;<i> I perfectly know about formal demonstrations being possible too (I spoke
</I>&gt;<i> about those matters for a long time last year in a completely different
</I>&gt;<i> context) but they're not unit-tests (certainly not the ones you see in
</I>&gt;<i> the twisted reposistory), so I didn't mention this to avoid further
</I>&gt;<i> confusion. I doubt it's feasible to demonstrate Twisted bug free
</I>&gt;<i> formally (to back my guess I remind you Alan Cox quote saying twisted is
</I>&gt;<i> a 6m unauditable weirdness, I guess he was partly joking though).
</I>
My apologies for starting a thread derail. I was simply responding to
your assertion that nothing can be proven to be bug free. Rather petty
of me in hindsight.

&gt;<i> My current worries are the troubles with poll, I worry about the lack of
</I>&gt;<i> epoll, I worry about scaling in SMP with one thread per cpu. Those are
</I>&gt;<i> the things that should be discussed instead of receiving emails from
</I>&gt;<i> people about lack of unit tests for fixes that can be trivially verified

</I>
We disagree on the 'trivially verified by reading code' part. It is my
opinion that only trivially simple code can be correctly verified simply
by reading it, particularly by so fallible a human as myself. Perhaps
your code reading skills are far superior to my own. Unit tests help me
to understand other's code. I have enough trouble understanding my own
code six months after writing it.

As you suggest, perhaps now is the time to move on to discussing other
issues?

[snip benchmarking bits]

Interesting reading. My apologies to everyone else on the list for
contributing to the... clutter.
