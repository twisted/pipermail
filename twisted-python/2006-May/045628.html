In my experience, sending big files over PB takes way too much time. This
is due to the serialization-deserialization process involved. Paging avoids
blocking, which is good, but it still takes much more than sending the
files as-is.

At the very least, optimize serialization by enable cBanana by uncommenting
the lines 311-318 in twisted.spread.banana.py . Why are they commented?

You could send the files over an HTTP connection, avoiding the
serialization overhead. Setting up HTTP clients and servers is very easy in
Twisted, as you surely know.
