That certainly seems to be the case, at least subjectively speaking - do we actually have any metrics on this though?  It'd be kind of neat to plot a graph.

&gt;<i>If we haven't responded to

</I>&gt;<i>incorrect, or c) the change didn't include sufficient unit tests.
</I>
Generally it's (a), or that the ticket didn't even get noticed.  Trac generates a nonstop flood of email to dozens of people and I'm sure most of it gets deleted without being read.

&gt;<i>Besides, I'm not sure why you're mentioning this, as you don't even
</I>&gt;<i>seem to be suggesting we include your qt reactor in Twisted since it's
</I>&gt;<i>untested and not using the new qt4 techniques. Or are you?
</I>
He has *another* ticket which didn't get merged... (it has test cases even).  It was itamar who requested he put the qt stuff into the tracker.
