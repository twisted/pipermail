Hi Glyph. The first thing I'm looking at is putting together a sync 
server. This will take some time. Once I have something, I'll be looking 
to measure the impact on zope. This should eliminate some speculatation 
and provide a clearer picture of performance.

At this point I'm hoping to have something a bit more concrete to 
discuss. I may be surprised - who knows. I am hoping this effort will 
result in something that will work well enough to use on zope's single 
reactor (if only for lighter use) in the interim.

If performance is not so hot, I will be revisit the multiple reactor 
issue. There is another person that I have been in contact with that is 
also interested in helping. But there is no point in going this 
direction just yet. Not without at least a demonstration server and 
client, and any proof a significant performance impact.

Regards,
David
