Thanks for the offer to take on this role, Ed.  *Not* to discourage
you, but as of late, we've had quite a few offers to help out with
various parts of Twisted but a lot of them haven't come to much.
The administrative costs are getting to be a significant burden on
some team members who are already swamped.  I think the best thing
to do would be to contribute improvements to the tracker for a
while (once you're all dried off ;).  We'll absolutely take the
time to get tickets in the tracker taken care of, but for now it'd
be best if we could avoid the setting up new accounts, dealing with
keys, poking trac in all the right places for edit permissions and
whatnot.  With the review process we're currently using, this isn't
very far from what you'd be doing anyway.  Once things slow down on
the administrative end and you are contributing enough improvements
for the overhead to be worthwhile, we can get you set up with
commit access and so forth.

Again, thank you for stepping up.  I am personally looking forward
to your contributions.

Jean-Paul
