Agreed. Frankly, I think you've been amazingly patient. And I certainly 
wholeheartedly back the current development policy, warts and all. To 
paraphrase Winston Churchill:

Many forms of Development have been tried, and will be tried in this 
world of sin and woe. No one pretends that test-driven development is 
perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that TDD is the worst form 
of development except all those other forms that have been tried from 
time to time.
