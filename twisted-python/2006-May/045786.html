My apologies.  These both look like pretty good reports and they should be reviewed soon.

As far as the process being the bottleneck - it's not the process, we just don't have enough manpower.  There are currently 619 open tickets in Twisted, and only 11 maintainers.  We're overwhelmed.  New tickets can't always get the attention they deserve.  This isn't particular to Twisted's process - your tickets would require review in pretty much any open source project.

(BTW, reviewers; if you are reviewing patches from external contributors, you *don't* need to create branches first.  If the branch passes review, simply comment on the ticket and reference it in the commit message.)

The easiest way to get a branch reviewed is to look for a reviewer on #twisted on Freenode in real-time.  If you make a point of mentioning that your code already includes test-cases, it will probably get reviewed faster.

If you want to get your contributed feature-additions to get reviewed and merged REALLY fast, go through the tracker and write patches which fix existing bugs for a while.  You will have dedicated maintainers practically at your beck and call ;).
