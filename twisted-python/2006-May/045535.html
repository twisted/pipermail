<PRE>Hi,

I'm not sure you are talking about the same topic. But I have just been
thinking about a threaded reactor.

Because my biggest itch with twisted is, that it can not really make use
multi-processor systems. Especially nowadays with dual-core or even
multi-core processors hitting the market this seems like a must-have.

In theory, it would be possible to start as many threads as you have
processors. All threads would process 'events' of the main loop. See for
example the apache event MPM for a better explaination of the algorithm.

Beside allowing only one thread at a time to call select(), this would
have other implications for twisted. I'm not sure about what they are,
but I can imagine it's a non-trivial goal.

How about todays python thread implementation? Did it improve over the
years? Is it worth using? What must be considered to get a reasonably
good performance using python threads?

..just some ideas. I'd be thankfull for hints, though.

Regards

Markus
