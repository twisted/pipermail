I think often a combination of checks are used: in particular, reading the code
and seeing that the fix &quot;makes sense&quot; in addition to an empiricial demonstration
of absence (exercising the fixed bug manually or by automated test) is very
common.  A fix is rarely accepted if it doesn't &quot;make sense&quot;, even if there's an
automated test case that suggests it works.

I think the problem may be different perspectives.

For Andrea, he's apparently already manually verified that his patches solve the
problems he's seen, so that's good enough.  Ignoring for a moment the issue of
what it takes to get it merged into official Twisted, further effort is wasted.

For people maintaining Twisted, a once-off manual verification isn't enough, for
the reasons you give.

So for Andrea's fixes to make the leap from &quot;good enough for him&quot; to &quot;good
enough to be merged into Twisted&quot;, they need more work: they need automated
tests.

-Andrew.
