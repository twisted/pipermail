If I'm not lazy this input driver is going to get written to convert the
existing web2 docs anyway.  I think he's mainly saying he's against it
for the purposes of allowing multiple documentation formats in the
source tree.  I don't think he'd find it terribly objectionable as a
&quot;feature&quot; of lore.  Atleast not enough to finding the energy to prevent
it from happening.

&gt;<i> I disagree with that conclusion, but have given up arguing the point. If

</I>
I just don't see any clear benefit ReST has over lore.  Especially not
with the amount of existing documentation that is in lore.  If anyone
would like to point out the benefit I'll gladly listen.
