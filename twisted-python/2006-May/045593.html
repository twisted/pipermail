If you were using digest auth, correct use of the headers (I can't
remember which one off the top of my head) it would allow &gt;1 http auth
session. I looked at this a while back; the issue being few orgs. have
an authentication database that can serve digest.

There's nothing to stop you sending a cookie AND requiring
WWW-Authenticate. Whether a non-browser client would see and round-trip
the cookie is another matter of course.

Possibly judicious use of 302s and url-based sessions would suffice, but
I don't know if that would impress or enrage REST purists - arguably you
could say the redirect was to a &quot;representation&quot; of the object hierarchy 
- google do something similar with the gdata API and rel=&quot;edit&quot; for 
Atom+HTTP based deletes.
