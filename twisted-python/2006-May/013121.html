<PRE>sAsync: SQLAlchemy Made Asynchronous
----------------------------------------
<A HREF="http://foss.eepatents.com/sAsync/">http://foss.eepatents.com/sAsync/</A>

&quot;sAsync offers asynchronous access to the outstanding SQLAlchemy package
by Michael Bayer. It also provides SQLAlchemy enhancements including
persistent dictionaries, text indexing and searching, and an access
broker for conveniently managing database access, table setup, and
transactions. Everything can be run in an asynchronous fashion using the
Twisted framework and its deferred processing capabilities.&quot;

As the site goes on to say, this package is very much a work in
progress, and it's not even close to a release yet. It has only the
beginning of a test suite, none of the planned searching capability is
close to working, and it needs some more packaging work, for starters.
However, you can browse the package source files from the current SVN
trunk on the Trac site, or check out the current SVN trunk as follows:

svn co <A HREF="svn://eepatents.com/var/svn/sasync/trunk">svn://eepatents.com/var/svn/sasync/trunk</A> sasync

I very much hope that SQLAlchemy and Twisted users (especially those
interested in the integrated use of both projects) will offer
submissions. That can be done by creating tickets with uploaded files,
editing the Wiki page <A HREF="http://foss.eepatents.com/sAsync/wiki/Submissions,">http://foss.eepatents.com/sAsync/wiki/Submissions,</A>
or (if you're serious about this), by requesting and obtaining SVN
commit privileges for the project from me.

It would be great to see some collaborate work getting done on this. I'm
also interested in whether this would be a prospect for an add-on to SA
itself rather than a separately maintained package.

Best regards,
Ed Suominen
