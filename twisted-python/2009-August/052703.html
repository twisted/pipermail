Thanks for doing this.   All documentation help is useful :).

I've added a review of this document to my personal to-do list, but that
might take another couple of days.

In the meanwhile, I think the stuff you're trying to communicate is
valuable, but some of it seems pretty vague, and the ordering is a little
confusing.  For example,

For simple network activity you do not need to use deferreds
&gt;<i>
</I>
what constitutes &quot;simple&quot; network activity?  Does this means that there are
some types of network activity do require deferreds?  For that matter, is
&quot;network activity&quot; everything Twisted does, or just sending/receiving
bytes?  etc, etc.  I think it would be better to clearly and simply lay out
how to do &quot;simple&quot; network operations like sending and receiving data before
talking about Deferreds at all.  It may still be useful to say &quot;you don't
need Deferreds&quot; at some point, to make sure this is clear to the new user,
but that should come later, when you can illustrate more clearly *why* they
don't need Deferreds.

You also use the word &quot;seem&quot; a lot.  You should be more assertive, and just
say what things are or aren't, not what they seem like.  Don't worry about
being wrong.  If you write something wrong, we will correct you before it
goes into the docs :).
