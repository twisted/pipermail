No, it's a good suggestion - the only problem is that it makes the
problem happen far less often! What I've done is to capture the first
few bytes of each packet, enough to show the whole of the AMP reply
packets (which are just {'_answer':tag, 'status':True}) without any
need for full-scale analysis and reassembly.

I'm pleased to say that after many hours of watching tcpdump,
the bug eventually happened again just minutes before I left
for a long weekend. Sure enough, TCP/IP delivers the packet
successfully. Tomorrow's first task is going to be putting
tracing into the low-level code where the reactor is meant
to receive the packet and call the AMP _outstandingRequests
entry for it.

It would have been almost impossible to get even this far
without the Manhole feature. I've been using it all along
to inspect the workings of the client code, and it was a big
help on the server side too. The server handles a lot of
connections, and I was able to set a debug flag in the protocol
object for the connection I was tracing. There would have been
very much more log data otherwise. It makes a big difference
being able to see values of variables without having to add
new log statements and spend another working day waiting for
the bug. Whoever invented it - thank you!

Peter.
