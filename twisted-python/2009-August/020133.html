<PRE>&gt;<i> I get it, really.

Duly noted ;-).

&gt;<i> Where would we put an &quot;inventory&quot; project for it to be most useful?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  As JP mentioned earlier in this thread, some work has already taken

</I>&gt;<i> DocumentationAnalysis&gt;.
</I>
It doesn't really look like that effort went anywhere.

On:

	<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/DocumentationAnalysis/DocumentList">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/DocumentationAnalysis/DocumentList</A>

The first document is User reviewed by JoeBlow with Expert Reviews by  
JaneBlogs.

There are only five more entries and only one is &quot;completed&quot; with a  
User and Expert review.

What the heck that properly vetted doc has to do with anything is not  
particularly clear.

Maybe we should have an auction?

     Auction: Document blah-de-blah

	Supplier will document blah-de-blah, work with Sponsors to  
incorporate blah-de-blah into their apps, and release the copyright to  
the resultant documentation and copyright to the Twisted Software  
Foundation.

	Supplier will provide up to X hour of consulting to each of the first  
three Sponsors (Founding Sponsors) to help refine the documentation  
and make sure it can be used in real-world projects.

	Minimum Founder bid is $50.

	Minimum Contributor bid is $35.

	Sponsor1:
		I'll give $50 for someone to explain blah-de-blah and how to use it  
in my app

	Sponsor2:
		I'd give another $50 if I could get this working in my app

	Supplier1:

		I'd have to have $200 to take this on.

		I'll also offer discounted consulting on the same topic at $??/hr.  
to anyone who contributes $35 or more to this documentation project  
after

	 Sponsor3:	

		I'll chip in the extra $100 if I can be one of the first three.  I'm  
really stuck on blah-de-blah and could use some help.

	Moderator:

		Ok, we seem to have a deal.  Sponsor 1 is in for $50, Sponsor 2 is  
in for $50, Sponsor 3 is in for $100.

		Each of them receives X hours of help from Supplier 1 which will be  
used to advance their projects and improve the documentation.

		Any future Contributors, over $35, receive discounted consulting  
from Supplier1 at $??/hr. for any work related to this issue as well  
as access to beta versions of the documentation and early-release  
versions of the sample code.

		Please sign off on this agreement and submit your payment.

		Supplier1 agrees to provide a first draft within X-period-of-time.
	
		Consulting arrangements begin then.  The Twisted Software Foundation  
accepts a donation of 10% of all transactions for facilitating these  
transactions and to generally advance Twisted.  (<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedSoftwareFoundation">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedSoftwareFoundation</A> 
)

Just a thought...

P.S. I apologize in advance for any formatting issues with the above.   
Obviously, I'm not following the coding spec and pylint barfed on the  
whole thing... ;-).
