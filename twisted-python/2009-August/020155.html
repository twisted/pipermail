<PRE>Kevin
Thanks for the reply.

It's good to get some feedback on how someone else would go about tackling a
particular issue. It helps to confirm whether what you a retrying makes
sense.

Thanks

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is a really basic problem we are trying to decide about,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We have programs that run quite happily, so far. Its main task is to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> receive data from port A and send it out via port B. Then receive data via
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> port B and send it out via port A. It's pretty much like a chat setup. You
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just build up a list of connected clients and send data to them as required
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One side A receives some input from a tcp port - about 100-200 characters,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and forwards it to another port B. We do not need to wait for any response.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we get a response we pick that up through line receiver. We also run a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> calllater to check if we got a response on linereceiver within the timeframe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specified. If not we drop the connection.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Traffic coming in from port B is analysed and some subset is sent back to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> port A.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ignoring port A for the moment, just concentrating on port B, we have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tried three options:--
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. We set up a defer to handle the sendline to port B so that the reactor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would schedule it in its own good time. No threads involved using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standard twisted setup. When we get a response through receiveline we fire
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the callback defer. If we timeout via callLater we fire the errback to clear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the defer. In this case the defer does not seem to be doing very much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Now a fresh pair of eyes is looking at the code and saying why are we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using a deferred for sending data to port B. We could just issue a straight
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sendline as part of the main code and carry on. If we get a response via
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> linereceiver,we process it normally, otherwise we set our callLater running
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and timeout and lose the connection. So no deferreds required at all. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does seem to work.What we are not sure about is what penalty is incurred in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> terms of reliability or throughput by using sendline without a deferred. We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are not too sure what the holdup will be and whether it could end up halting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the show. Is it better to schedule these messages via deferreds or am I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> missing something obvious
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. So we then did an experiment and used defertothread to run the sendline
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a separate thread with its own defer to maximise the asynchronous running
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the code. So now we are running threads when one of the reasons for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> looking at twisted was that we could avoid threads as much as possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The conundrum we are trying to resolve now is which option should we use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do any of the options have a built-in problem awaiting the unwary. In theory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all 3 options work. But if No 1 works well enough for our volume of traffic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should we adopt that one. Or is it better to start using the defertothread
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> option. Is there a simple answer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The traffic is not large, upto a 100-200 remote devices on port B. They
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will send GPS data every 20 secs, and about 500 messages of about 200 bytes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> average throught the day. The remote devices will respond in an irregular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manner without dropping the connection, so we force a disconnectf if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important messages are not getting through. They are then forced to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reconnect.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We have looked through the code searching for enlightment and it does seem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be well documented, but the information we are looking for comes well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before the doc strings.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hopefully, someone can give us some pointers in the right direction.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for any help.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that the volume of traffic you are dealing with isn't so
</I>&gt;<i> high that you need to worry too much about direct sendline causing
</I>&gt;<i> problems.  If I were writing this from scratch based on my understanding of
</I>&gt;<i> what you've written above, I would probably go with option 2. (Keep in mind,
</I>&gt;<i> my understanding may be flawed...so...)  However, if you've already got
</I>&gt;<i> things working with option 1, and the added complexity isn't causing you any
</I>&gt;<i> trouble, I don't see any real reason not to use that, since you've already
</I>&gt;<i> got that working.  Others may disagree...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Option 3 seems totally unnecessary to me.  I typically stay away from
</I>&gt;<i> threads in Twisted unless I have a long running non-network process to deal
</I>&gt;<i> with (disk access, db access, heavy math processing, etc.).  Especially
</I>&gt;<i> because of the relative &quot;heaviness&quot; of threads when using Python (due to
</I>&gt;<i> complex interactions with the GIL), I would avoid this method...it will
</I>&gt;<i> probably hurt performance more than Option 1 (though still probably not
</I>&gt;<i> enough to matter).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Others feel free to slap me if I'm giving bad advice :)
