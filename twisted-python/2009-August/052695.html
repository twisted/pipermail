<PRE>&gt;<i> Have you read this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2009/02/explaining-why-interfaces-are-great.html">http://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2009/02/explaining-why-interfaces-are-great.html</A>
</I>
Yep, I have (and just read it again).  I think I get it, sort of, kind
of, but I don't think I'll really understand it until it all comes
together.

&gt;&gt;<i> The thing is, t.p.nmea.NMEAAdapter needs to (at least, I think so)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implement all of the methods of t.p.ipositioning.IPositioningProvider,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because people will subclass t.p.nmea.NMEAAdapter and override the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corresponding (stub) methods.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think this is the case.  NMEAAdapter implements INMEAReceiver.  It
</I>&gt;<i> should take an IPositioningProvider as an argument somewhere, not implement
</I>&gt;<i> that interface itself.
</I>
Ah, that makes much more sense, indeed. I'm guessing that people
should be allowed to connect multiple such providers, instead of just
one? Otherwise I could always implement one that takes multiple such
providers as *its* argument later of course.

&gt;<i> A user implementing a position-aware application should be encouraged as
</I>&gt;<i> strongly as possible to avoid any NMEA-specific junk in their application
</I>&gt;<i> until it comes time to connect the app logic (IPositioningProvider) to the
</I>&gt;<i> actual device spitting out NMEA data.  After all, they're not going to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to easily make use of cell-tower positioning information if their
</I>&gt;<i> application class is hard-coded to subclass NMEAAdapter.
</I>
That makes even more sense.

&gt;&gt;<i> In order to get all of the stub methods implemented (otherwise people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using the class need to implement *every* method, which is dumb, since a lot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of people won't care about things like GPS climb),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The general sentiment here is right, despite the terminology problem I
</I>&gt;<i> pointed out: somewhere, a user is going to implement an IPositioningProvider
</I>&gt;<i> and it's quite likely that they won't want to implement every method.  So
</I>&gt;<i> let's assume there's going to be a BasePositioningProvider which stubs out
</I>&gt;<i> many of these methods or unifies / simplifies them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would basically be copying every line of the body of the interface into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the t.p.nmea.NMEAAdapter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not quite.  For one thing, your method declaration lines will have a 'self'
</I>&gt;<i> in BasePositioningProvider, and in IPositioningProvider they won't.  (I
</I>&gt;<i> notice that this is not currently the case.  You should probably fix that:
</I>&gt;<i> interface method definitions should never include 'self'.)
</I>
Fixed in trunk, thanks.

&gt;<i> Also, your methods' docstrings won't need to be as complete as those on the
</I>&gt;<i> interface, since they can just say &quot;implement L{IPositioningProvider.foo}
</I>&gt;<i> to...&quot;.
</I>
&gt;<i> Finally, I hope most of the methods will actually have a body that has some
</I>&gt;<i> implementation; some default behavior that will be useful  For example,
</I>&gt;<i> remembering the last position / heading / speed / error so that
</I>&gt;<i> 'positionReceived' can conveniently expect the last error received without
</I>&gt;<i> implementing that method itself.  One or two might be completely stubbed
</I>&gt;<i> out, but the interface can't contain any implementation.
</I>
The adapter already keeps state. I think this is necessary, because of
the way NMEA fragments information in sentences. I'm not sure how that
implementation would work though -- wouldn't people that care about
position end up overriding that method, hence making the non-stub
useless?

&gt;&gt;<i> This sounds like a dumb idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's assume the worst case: BasePositioningProvider has absolutely no
</I>&gt;<i> default behavior besides a no-op.  The level of duplication we're talking
</I>&gt;<i> about here is this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     def positionReceived(self, latitude, longitude):
</I>&gt;<i>     def positioningErrorReceived(self, positioningError):
</I>&gt;<i>     def headingReceived(self, heading):
</I>&gt;<i>     def headingErrorReceived(self, headingError):
</I>&gt;<i>     def magneticHeadingReceived(self, magneticHeading):
</I>&gt;<i>     def altitudeReceived(self, altitude):
</I>&gt;<i>     def altitudeErrorReceived(self, altitudeError):
</I>&gt;<i>     def speedReceived(self, speed):
</I>&gt;<i>     def speedErrorReceived(self, speedError):
</I>&gt;<i>     def climbReceived(self, climb):
</I>&gt;<i>     def climbErrorReceived(self, climbError):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, the duplicated code in question will be considerably shorter
</I>&gt;<i> than the body of the message you composed to fret about code duplication,
</I>&gt;<i> and way shorter than my response :-). This doesn't really seem excessive,
</I>&gt;<i> considering that there's no duplication of functionality (the interface only
</I>&gt;<i> specifies behavior, the base class implements it), only duplication of text.
</I>
Okay, I'll implement that class, expect it in trunk soon :-)

thanks for your response
Laurens
