</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Unfortunately, some of Trial's cleanup code spins the reactor (see

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are saying this part of the plan will happen post-2.5, I assume?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
At the least, post #2091. The first wave is &quot;deal with dirty reactor
failing the suite&quot;, the second wave is &quot;drastically increase standards
of cleanliness&quot;.

This gets taken up below.


&gt;<i> &gt;2. Tighten test cleanup errors. (Twisted 2.5)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;#2091 (ready for review) fulfils a long-standing promise. The &quot;reactor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;unclean&quot; warnings have been turned into errors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would really like it to be possible to turn these errors into warnings by passing a command-line flag, mainly for the migration path between 2.4 and 2.5.
</I>
As you have wished, so have I done.


&gt;<i> Twisted's buildslaves should _NOT_ use this flag, nor should it still be present in 2.6.  I am suggesting it _ONLY_ as a migration tool.
</I>
Good. I wasn't looking forward to fighting you to the death: my mech
is in dry-dock.


&gt;<i> &gt;That means we will have to either:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;a) surprise our users with new errors in their tests
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;b) find some way to introduce this gradually.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this might be another use-case for a flag.  Really, developers should be alerted
</I>&gt;<i> to these changes as soon as possible (warnings are too easily ignored), but have a way
</I>&gt;<i> to give themselves a little leeway to fix the problems before the next release.
</I>
The --unclean-warnings flag will take care of this.


&gt;<i> &gt;Currently TestCase.run() is a blocking call. I wish it could remain a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;blocking call, but it can't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why do you say you wish it could?  Isn't the whole point here to make it not be a blocking call?
</I>
If the reactors were restartable, it could remain a blocking call
without sucking. As it is, I can't have both &quot;blocking&quot; and &quot;not
sucking&quot;. So I'm sacrificing the former to get closer to the latter.


&gt;<i> &gt;4. Deprecate TestSuite.run and TestCase.run. (Twisted 2.6)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In what sense are these APIs &quot;public&quot;?  Are there really people calling them outside of the 'trial' tool?
</I>
Some people use Trial tests with other tools. Similarly, overriding
run() is the place to start if you want to extend TestCase
functionality.


&gt;<i> &gt;[1] Incidentally, all of this would be superfluous if reactors were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;restartable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A clean restart() API would be a possible way of fixing some things, but I think you
</I>&gt;<i> are underestimating how much code would break with a clean restart() method, too.
</I>&gt;<i> For example: the threadpool would be stopped after each test.  Would that make any
</I>&gt;<i> existing Twisted tests fail?  I don't know, but operating under your (probably correct)
</I>&gt;<i> pessimistic assumption that any change to the test framework's interaction with the
</I>&gt;<i> reactor will break some things, I'd have to say yes.
</I>
Yes, they would fail. We currently kill the threadpool after every
test *class*, not test case, because some people put certain things in
setUpClass once.


 &gt; Then there is the issue that Bob recently brought up, which is that
in a 'normal' Twisted
&gt;<i> application the reactor is only started once, and so it's not really a representative test to
</I>&gt;<i> constantly be pausing and resuming it.  If we implement a restartable reactor it would
</I>&gt;<i> probably be a good torture-test though.
</I>
Lots of unit test tropes aren't representative of real applications.
&quot;Normal&quot; applications don't establish a connection, do one thing, then
disconnect.


Thanks for replying!
