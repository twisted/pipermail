I started off doing this actually, and decided to switch to Axiom  
because it was object-relational. I've had some no-so-fun experiences  
with Plone and ZODB madness, but it probably has more to do with not  
understanding what was going on.

For the most part, as long as all the database-related work goes on  
on the server side, whether I use ZODB or Axiom probably doesn't make  
much of a difference to the rest of the application.

Thanks. Actually most of my database access so far is along the lines  
of the client sending an object to the server (along with its child  
objects), and the server persists it (and add/edits/removes the  
children to suit). Your typical CRUD GUI.

&gt;<i> Regardless of these

</I>
I have heard this before yes. Actually I there will be more reading  
going on than writing. The application is your basic database-with- 
reports type application, so I'd say it would not be write heavy.

As am I :) What I'm trying to I believe can be done with Twisted PB.  
Calling remote methods on all clients who have an object which is  
pb.Cacheable is quite easy to do. I am just unsure about how to go  
about it in a generic way. Also I'm sure there's a lot more to  
creating a distributed object system than meets the eye, but then  
again Twisted PB handles much of the heavy lifting.

Originally, I planned to do much of the work on the server, and one  
thing I liked about Twisted was that I could easy decide what work  
was done on the client, and what on the server. Now that I'm a little  
further in developmentI realise that the clients would really benifit  
from having much of that data locally, so that can search/make PDF  
reports etc. easily. Perhaps I'm just using Twisted wrong and I  
should be doing this on the server? I'm really I'm happy for the  
clients do *all* the work, which is why I'm back to considering ZEO  
again. The server just needs to handle authentication and access  
control, ensuring everyone has the latest copy of an object, make  
sure two users aren't allowed to open a edit GUI for some object at  
the same time, etc.

One important point, is that with ZEO I just code as if the database  
was a local ZODB. I like that because it saves literally hundreds of  
lines of code dealing with sending objects back and forth, notifying  
clients etc.

&gt;<i> I think I've heard noises about
</I>&gt;<i> Axiom starting to support other databases beyond sqllite, so  
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps it is
</I>&gt;<i> not beyond the realm of possibility that you could connect a bunch of

</I>&gt;<i> For that matter, sqlite has

</I>&gt;<i> way, I think
</I>&gt;<i> you'd be on the bleeding edge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If I were to go this way, then I wouldn't really be using Twisted  
right? In this case, I may as well use ZEO. Perhaps I'm taking the  
wrong approach - maybe all I need is a database server which clients  
connect to, and do away with the whole of Twisted cred/PB etc. that  
I'm using?

&gt;<i> Boy, I'm a big help, eh?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Actually you were thanks!
