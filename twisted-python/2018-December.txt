Are you using coverage.py?  I don't know offhand but does Twisted use `thread` or `threading`?

You have to be using one of those to use threads in Python. Does Twisted 
use the older/lower level `thread` library?

Saw this...

Was wondering if there's a fastcgi client out there for twisted?

Thanks,

The fact that a reactor is returned by install is a bit of a mistake and is
not really part of the interface of *install.*

For whatever reason, asyncioreactor.install doesn't bother to return the
reactor it creates.

You should do this instead:

from twisted.internet import wxreactor

wxreactor.install()

from twisted.internet import reactor


Or don't do reactor installation yourself at all, use twistd or twist or
some other similar tool.
