Message-ID: <CAEeXt4P86U5Ry_9QfmXSHmDC080cebzK+H+BR4On_BDEBuPCqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm pleased to announce the release of txAWS 0.3.0.  txAWS is a library for
interacting with
Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Twisted.

You can download the release from PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txAWS>
 (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txAWS).

txAWS development uses GitHub for issues and source control
<https://github.com/twisted/txaws> (https://github.com/twisted/txaws).

Since the last release, the following enhancements have been made:

   - Jean-Paul Calderone added basic Route53 support.
   - Mark Williams add Auth v4, now used by the S3 and Route53 support.
   - Francisco Souza added support for VPCs to some EC2 APIs.
   - Drew Smathers added multi-part S3 upload support.
   - Several people added other S3 client features such as pagination and
   streaming uploads.
   - *txaws.testing* now provides S3 and Route53 support.

Additionally, the following APIs have been deprecated:

   - The *client* attribute of *txaws.client.base.BaseQuery*
   - The *date* attribute of *txaws.s3.client.Query*

Thanks to everyone who contributed and to Least Authority Enterprises
<https://leastauthority.com/> (<https://leastauthority.com/>) for
sponsoring my work on this release.

Message-ID: <CAEeXt4PHtC9kGC-Qo4DoLqEJg0nCBZ3Lmm64naSnMAfXyW09vg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm pleased to announce the first release of txkube, a Twisted-based
library for interacting with Kubernetes using the HTTP API.

This release supports several of the most commonly used basic Kubernetes
objects, including Services, ConfigMaps, Deployments, ReplicaSets, and
Pods.  While Kubernetes has many, many more object kinds, this collection
of kinds already supports a very useful set of interactions.

Here is an example of txkube usage, taken from the README:

   from __future__ import print_function
   from twisted.internet.task import react

   from txkube import v1, network_kubernetes_from_context

   @react
   def main(reactor):
       k8s = network_kubernetes_from_context(reactor, u"minikube")
       client = k8s.client()
       d = client.list(v1.Namespace)
       d.addCallback(print)
       return d

You can download txkube from PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>.
You can contribute to its development on GitHub
<https://github.com/LeastAuthority/txkube>.

Thanks to Least Authority Enterprises <https://leastauthority.com/> for
sponsoring this development.

Thanks for the announcement!

I do have one question about txkube, since this comes up periodically in every higher-level networking layer, and it's a place where I think Twisted has some advantages over other HTTP clients: is there a way to specify custom trust roots, or construct a custom Agent to pass in to txkube?

There's another constructor for IKubernetesService
<https://github.com/LeastAuthority/txkube/blob/b2e81400e40989696f82cabfd575d5283f7180e8/src/txkube/_interface.py>,
network_kubernetes
<https://github.com/LeastAuthority/txkube/blob/b2e81400e40989696f82cabfd575d5283f7180e8/src/txkube/_network.py#L41-L56>.
It takes an IAgent.  So one can do:

    network_kubernetes(base_url=url, agent=Agent(contextFactory=...))

Does that approach fit with any emerging conventions for exposing this kind
of functionality?  I'd be happy to adapt it if there's a better pattern.

Also note that it's common for Kubernetes to be deployed with a self-signed
or other non-cartel certificate.  So even the API in the example,
network_kubernetes_from_context, doesn't trust the usual web-oriented
collection of CAs.  It only respects the certificate found in the local
Kubernetes configuration.  This means that there's another way to control
this - edit ~/.kube/config and put the desired CA certificate there.

I think that's the state of the art, and it's a good primitive to build upon. If something needs to change, it's not the way txkube (et. al.) accept their argument, but rather a function in Twisted somewhere that computes the Towers of Hanoi Agent-stacking solution that Treq contains: https://github.com/twisted/treq/blob/b436c6c89b3a1b7fb2ecb5300ae24bcbea20fad0/src/treq/client.py#L198-L217

> Also note that it's common for Kubernetes to be deployed with a self-signed or other non-cartel certificate.  So even the API in the example, network_kubernetes_from_context, doesn't trust the usual web-oriented collection of CAs.  It only respects the certificate found in the local Kubernetes configuration.  This means that there's another way to control this - edit ~/.kube/config and put the desired CA certificate there.

Cool.  Although this is actually exactly what I'd expect (as I would imagine most Kubernetes users) this behavior sounds like something that might be worth calling out in the README.

Hey! I don't know I should ask this question or not but as a beginner I
have to ask.
I have just started learn python network programming and fortunately found
such an amazing Twisted Framework. As a beginner I could not be able to
decide where to start I mean what should I make first using twisted
framework. I would be very thankful to you for guiding me.
Pardon me for bad english!

Welcome! Glad you found Twisted, it really is awesome!

I personally like telnet-like servers. They are very easy to make with 
the LineReceiver protocol (hint hint), and you can do a lot with them.

I guess the most basic one is some kind of echo server / client that 
simply echos back whatever you type.

For more help, don't forget the Twisted documentation and the examples 
therein on http://www.twistedmatrix.com

> Pardon me for bad english!

Not to worry at all, everyone is welcome.

If you want *telnet* then you should probably use *twisted.conch.telnet*.
It's a little bit more complicated than *LineReceiver* but it will actually
speak telnet for you.  LineReceiver will get you some simple line-oriented
interactions, though.

Ah, than you. I could never figure out how to make the proper 
TelnetProtocol to do anything useful, and line-based is all I've ever 
really needed.

Thank you for the tip though.

The module would certainly benefit from some prose documentation.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] txtorcon versioning
Message-ID: <864lxtmkzx.fsf@atlantis.meejah.ca>


I will soon release the next version of txtorcon with a ton of cool new
features. This will be called 0.19.0. More details: 

   http://timaq4ygg2iegci7.onion/releases.html

Going forward, versioning will switch to a "CalVer.org" variant. At one
point, I thought of breaking a few now-regrettable APIs.

However, I will not do this.

The next version after 0.19.0 will be 17.x.y
Changes in any existing APIs will be done by first introducing the new
thing, deprecating the old thing and eventually removing the old
thing. The new documentation's "programming guide" includes some notes
on API stability. I have not to date broken/changed any existing
API. Also at this point nothing is deprecated (but there are "preferred"
APIs).

The onion services APIs *will* change for the 17.x release.

New code should follow the recommendations in the programming
guide. Existing code will continue to work for the forseeable future.

thanks,
meejah

If you don't mind, could you describe your reasoning behind this decision?
I am always curious to learn any concrete reasons behind this. If this
seems spammy to the mailing list, please feel free to respond only to me.

Mostly because I don't want to ever have breaking changes, so then
you're "not supposed" to upgdate the big version number. I haven't found
that "semantic versioning" has been working very well for the
release-style of txtorcon.

Other, less important reasons: Twisted does this; it's easier to tell
"how new" a release is; and big version numbers are cool (just kidding).

Hi,

Moshe Zadka recently gave a very good presentation on using Twisted as a
WSGI container for Django or Flask apps at the San Francisco Django Meetup:

https://rawgit.com/moshez/talks/master/twist-wsgi/twist-wsgi.html

The examples in this presentation should be cleaned up and maybe put on the
front page of the twistedmatrix web site.  Many Python developers are using
frameworks like Django and Flask.  That would be a good way to get new
developers interested in Twisted.

Thank you, this looks very interesting.

As I was planning to ask a relevant question, let me add it here:

Are there any similar resources for other web frameworks, for example
Pyramid? And when I say resources, I mean talks, presentations or just a
web page with example code.

I think it would be helpful to have a page in the Twisted site, with links
to such resources - and perhaps a page for each (Django, Flask, Pyramid,
etc) with sample code and specific issues/tips than have been encountered
when combining Twisted with other frameworks.

"Hendrix" is a tool for running various frameworks under Twisted; I'm pretty sure Pyramid is one of them (although I don't have a direct link to pyramid-specific docs handy):

https://hendrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ <https://hendrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

For the most part, general WSGI documentation should get you most of the way there with specific frameworks though.  This used to be a lot worse but in recent years there's been a lot of convergence.

The Twisted site is a wiki, and if you are interested in curating such a page, I'm happy to give you the relevant edit permissions.

I have to disagree here BTW.  When I started using Twisted as a WSGI container, I was vexed by its lack of docs (and I’m still confused about many details).  There’s a few blog posts around but none of them reach the straight-forwardibility of e.g. gunicorn’s docs.  I’ve ended up asking around on IRC, stealing from Donald/PyPI, and reading source code.

I honestly believe, we’re leaving money on the table here.  Using Twisted as a WSGI container should be first class use case on the web page since it presents a nice entry drug into the ecosystem.

There’s also barely any information on *why* one would want to use Twisted as a WSGI container.  And please keep in mind that to many, many (most likely: the majority) of Python users “pure Python” doesn’t mean “safe” but “slow.” C.f. all those “lightning fast pure C” frameworks popping up left and right, upvoted to nirvana on reddit and its likes.   If we want to do marketing, we have to be a tad more user-focused. :)

***

What I’m saying is that this topic shouldn’t be relegated into some wiki (where information famously is going to die) but should be a prominent tab on the landing page (maybe with additional information for specific frameworks in the wiki).

Cheers,

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Elliptic Curve support
Message-ID: <CACyevsWjNPeuahTn3WU1yVOi8thL+ex6Q6o03S8ea146=i5Rhg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm taking Glyph's suggestion and bringing this to the mailing list. :)

I still believe it was unwise to remove the support for the extra EC curves
in PR #749 for a few reasons that I've said in a few different places so
I'll summarize them here.

*  Support for more curves is better.  It gives more options to users and
developers such as myself who want to use Twisted for custom environments.
All of this widens the support base.

*  These are all curves suggested in RFC 5656, and I believe the more
Twisted supports the RFC the better.

*  There are cases for using alternative curves.  NIST-T-571 is stronger
than any of the currently supported curves.  NIST-K-163 is weaker, but
there are still uses for it. I may be working in an embedded environment
where every CPU cycle counts and I just need simple encryption to protect
against simple plain text scanning.

* Having extra curves does not make Twisted less secure.  SSH negotiates
encryption based on a list of preferred ciphers.  We put the strongest
ciphers first and the weaker curves only get used if nothing better is
available where weak encryption is still better than no encryption.

There are other reasons why I think it makes sense to have the curves in
Twisted but these are the main ones.

Message-ID: <CAEeXt4OFr+wN0iPjqQSL+n4N+MiM_9-dFLncXtHt5DQV4bVh_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm pleased to announce the initial release of kubetop, a command-line tool
in the style of top(1) for displaying current usage and activity of a
Kubernetes cluster.

kubetop 17.4.17.1 will format information about your Kubernetes cluster
like this:

kubetop - 13:02:57
Node 0 CPU%   9.80 MEM% 57.97 (   2 GiB/   4 GiB)  POD%  7.27 (  8/110) Ready
Node 1 CPU%  21.20 MEM% 59.36 (   2 GiB/   4 GiB)  POD%  3.64 (  4/110) Ready
Node 2 CPU%  99.90 MEM% 58.11 (   2 GiB/   4 GiB)  POD%  7.27 (  8/110) Ready
Pods:       20 total        0 running        0 terminating        0 pending
                 POD               (CONTAINER)        %CPU         MEM   %MEM
s4-infrastructure-3073578190-2k2vw                    75.5  782.05 MiB  20.76
                      (subscription-converger)        72.7  459.11 MiB
                                 (grid-router)         2.7   98.07 MiB
                                         (web)         0.1   67.61 MiB
                        (subscription-manager)         0.0   91.62 MiB
                       (foolscap-log-gatherer)         0.0   21.98 MiB
                                       (flapp)         0.0   21.46 MiB
                              (wormhole-relay)         0.0   22.19 MiB


kubetop is meant as a handy tool to use at the spur of the moment.  It is
not intended to replace a real monitoring system.

kubetop's presentation is preliminary and a work in progress.
Contributions welcome.

You can find kubetop on PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/kubetop> and
GitHub <https://github.com/LeastAuthority/kubetop>.  Install it in the
usual way:

pip install kubetop


Thanks to Least Authority Enterprises <https://leastauthority.com/> for

Hi,

I do think letting users configure the permissible curves (and their 
priority) using a public tx API, and exposing all of the curves that the 
underlying openssl provides is important.

FWIW, the german BSI (a state IT security institute that provides 
recommendations, and certifications) now recommends:

brainpoolP256r1, brainpoolP384r1, brainpoolP512r1

and only if none of these is avail, falls back to

secp256r1, secp384r1

Page 15 (3.6.1) here:

https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/TechnischeRichtlinien/TR02102/BSI-TR-02102-2.pdf?__blob=publicationFile

--

Currently, eg Crossbar.io is using secp256r1 (not configurable)

https://github.com/crossbario/crossbar/blob/master/crossbar/twisted/tlsctx.py#L331
https://github.com/crossbario/crossbar/blob/master/crossbar/twisted/tlsctx.py#L206

and we would like to move to a configurable, maintainable solution.

Cheers,
/Tobias

All I was saying here is that frameworks have gotten better about being "just WSGI" and not requiring a lot of crazy customization on the framework side of things.  But, you're absolutely right that we need better docs, many parts of the setup are not obvious!

Also agreed here.

Yep.  And things like Moshe's talk are wonderful resources to try to illuminate this unfortunately dark area, so I do appreciate people taking the time to do them.  I do also think that being a bit more strategic about it might result in vastly greater adoption though.

The front page is also the wiki :-).  I'm happy to have it there, I just think that it should perhaps be workshopped a little bit on a draft page first.

Personally I'm not using Kubernetes much, but this looks SUPER handy.  And it seems to install cleanly with `pipsi install kubetop` :-).  Thanks for the announcement!

I did see this in my install output though:

  Running setup.py bdist_wheel for attr ... done
  Stored in directory: /Users/glyph/Library/Caches/pip/wheels/39/a7/44/cce905c824a2266d3e5747b2de72c8d73f9c8e9f0a71f066cd

Is this actually supposed to depend on https://pypi.python.org/pypi/attr <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/attr> ?  It seems likely to me that this was a typo somewhere in the dependency chain for https://pypi.python.org/pypi/attrs <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/attrs> .

Thank you :).  Hopefully some people more qualified than me will comment...

> I still believe it was unwise to remove the support for the extra EC curves in PR #749 for a few reasons that I've said in a few different places so I'll summarize them here.

I have some arguments with the form of your argument here, but I should emphasize that I don't know enough about the specific underlying crypto to go one way or another - mostly I'm trusting the opinions of Alex Gaynor, and your counterpoints are not convincing (yet).

> *  Support for more curves is better.  It gives more options to users and developers such as myself who want to use Twisted for custom environments.  All of this widens the support base.

Not necessarily.  Support for more curves may allow or encourage the use of insecure curves by naive users.

> *  These are all curves suggested in RFC 5656, and I believe the more Twisted supports the RFC the better.

RFC 5656 is very old.  Specifically: pre-heartbleed, pre-snowden, pre-BULLRUN revelations.  Just because it's in that RFC is not a compelling argument for its inclusion.

> *  There are cases for using alternative curves.  NIST-T-571 is stronger than any of the currently supported curves.  NIST-K-163 is weaker, but there are still uses for it. I may be working in an embedded environment where every CPU cycle counts and I just need simple encryption to protect against simple plain text scanning.

These types of use-cases do not require these curves to be enabled by conch by default.  They just require there being a public API to enable these things.

> * Having extra curves does not make Twisted less secure.

If they are enabled by default, it very well can.

> SSH negotiates encryption based on a list of preferred ciphers.  We put the strongest ciphers first and the weaker curves only get used if nothing better is available where weak encryption is still better than no encryption.

Or if an adversary successfully executes a downgrade attack.

There's downgrade detection in SSH, but we shouldn't rely on it to be perfect.

> There are other reasons why I think it makes sense to have the curves in Twisted but these are the main ones.

I think it might be more productive to argue for the inclusion of individual curves on a case-by-case basis.  "should it be included at all" and "should it be enabled by default" are also separate questions.

There’s a few blog posts around but none of them reach the straight-forwardibility of e.g. gunicorn’s docs.  I’ve ended up asking around on IRC, stealing from Donald/PyPI, and reading source code.

Yeah, I didn’t actually mean to disagree as much as use it as an opportunity to voice something that has been brewing in me for a while. :)

>> There’s also barely any information on *why* one would want to use Twisted as a WSGI container.  And please keep in mind that to many, many (most likely: the majority) of Python users “pure Python” doesn’t mean “safe” but “slow.” C.f. all those “lightning fast pure C” frameworks popping up left and right, upvoted to nirvana on reddit and its likes.   If we want to do marketing, we have to be a tad more user-focused. :)
> Yep.  And things like Moshe's talk are wonderful resources to try to illuminate this unfortunately dark area, so I do appreciate people taking the time to do them.  I do also think that being a bit more strategic about it might result in vastly greater adoption though.

Yeah Moshe’s evangelism made me interested in the topic but it’s hard to find anything more than his material.  Particularly a good reference guide.  As you wrote, the particular integration with web frameworks is trivial (but should be provided!)

>> What I’m saying is that this topic shouldn’t be relegated into some wiki (where information famously is going to die) but should be a prominent tab on the landing page (maybe with additional information for specific frameworks in the wiki).
> The front page is also the wiki :-).  I'm happy to have it there, I just think that it should perhaps be workshopped a little bit on a draft page first.

Heh absolutely.  Just wanna stress that it should come right after “Web Server” in the “Code Examples” tabs. :)

Oh and I’d like to propose to officially merge the twisted-web mailing list into this one.  I don’t think it makes any sense to separate those two anymore.  It’s hard to do anything without web nowadays. :)

I'm definitely inclined to agree about this. I don't think it's had enough independent activity to justify its continued existence.  The perceived need for a separate list was a cultural feature of an earlier time :).

I think if you log in you should be able to create and edit most pages, although the front page will be locked.  Let me know if that is not the case.

Glyph, I understand your and other's concerns, and while clearly I feel a
little differently, my real concern was how the curves I was using were
suddenly not supported at all. Which is why I think the API you and Tobias
suggested is a good compromise.

I have the code to do this just about ready and will submit a ticket and PR
shortly.

I'm still a little unclear as to why you were specifically using these curves, which I think informs this discussion somewhat :).  For example, if you're testing with intentionally weak curves then we should be putting these behind an API that is as awkward to use as possible :).

> I have the code to do this just about ready and will submit a ticket and PR shortly.

Cool.  Hopefully our cryptographers in residence will have no issue with an API that you have to call to specifically enable these.

If someone was not dedicated to Twisted, why would they even bother going
through all the steps that you did to
figure out how to use Twisted as a WSGI container?  I'm amazed that even
you did not give up. :)

Do you have any idea how Twisted fares in performance benchmarks of WSGI
containers?
Moshe's presentation didn't cover this, and I forgot to ask him at the
presentation.
I also couldn't find any WSGI benchmarks which included Twisted.

Do be honest, it probably doesn't do all that well.  Making the container multi-process (as Moshe notes) would be a good first step to getting something worth benchmarking.

But, I should note, the obsession with benchmarks in WSGI containers is a symptom of a generally industry-wide lack of understanding of good performance analysis.  The fastest WSGI container is probably 2% of your application's overhead; the slowest possible one, maybe 3%.  The differences look huge when you're comparing servers against each other, but throw a real application and a database and some load balancer latency in there and the app server container utterly disappears.  Even multi-process support isn't really about optimizing for performance (although certainly leveraging multiple cores helps), it's about being able to safely crash a WSGI container process without bringing down the whole server.

This is a problem in twisted.  Buldbot uses twisted.

To make buildbot git polling work for me, I had to make the change below.

I left a comment on that ticket forwarding the straightforward fix that can
be applied to BuildBot to address this problem.

It's certainly true that there are shortcomings in the spawnProcess API so
I won't try to argue that this *isn't* a problem in Twisted.  However, some
of those very problems make it difficult to *fix* any of the problems.  It
seems more likely that spawnProcess will eventually be replaced by a better
API (if the problems are ever fixed at all, that is).  Meanwhile, since the
fix in BuildBot is quite simple, that seems like a good direction to pursue.

spawnProcess may remain a useful primitive for something higher-level, or it might be replaced, but there has been some discussion of what that might be for quite some time:

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2415 <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2415>

Getting some new momentum on that ticket would be good.

Message-ID: <86tw5ijn0j.fsf@atlantis.meejah.ca>


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I'm very happy to release txtorcon 0.19.0. This merges most of the
development that happened over the last several months on the
release-1.x branch. Featuring:

 * Full Python3 support (and universal wheels)

 * Drop txsocksx and use a custom implementation (this also implements
   the custom Tor SOCKS5 methods RESOLVE and RESOLVE_PTR). Uses
   Automat for the state-machine.

 * Drop support for older Twisted releases (12, 13 and 14 are no
   longer supported).

 * Add a top-level API object (txtorcon.Tor) that abstracts a running
   Tor. Instances of this class are created with txtorcon.connect or
   txtorcon.launch. These instances are intended to be "the"
   high-level API and most users shouldn't need anything else.

 * Integrated support for twisted.web.client.Agent, baked into
   txtorcon.Tor. This allows simple, straightforward use of treq or
   "raw" twisted.web.client for making client-type Web requests via
   Tor. Automatically handles configuration of SOCKS ports.

 * new high-level API for putting streams on specific Circuits. This
   adds txtorcon.Circuit.stream_via and txtorcon.Circuit.web_agent
   methods that work the same as the "Tor" equivalent methods except
   they use a specific circuit. This makes
   txtorcon.TorState.set_attacher the "low-level" / "expert"
   interface. Most users should only need the new API.

 * big revamp / re-write of the documentation, including the new
   Programming Guide:
   https://txtorcon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html

 * Issue 203: https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon/issues/203

 * new helper: txtorcon.Router.get_onionoo_details which downloads
   JSON for a particular relay from OnionOO

 * new helper: txtorcon.util.create_tbb_web_headers which returns
   headers resembling a recent Tor Browser suitable for use with
   Twisted or treq web agents.

 * Issue 72: https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon/issues/72

 * Specific SocksError subclasses for all the available SOCKS5 errors
   added by https://github.com/felipedau

 * (more) Python3 fixes from https://github.com/rodrigc

You can download the release from PyPI or GitHub (or of course "pip
install txtorcon"):

   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txtorcon/0.19.0
   https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon/releases/tag/v0.19.0

As per our previously documented entirely arbitrary[1] and ad-hoc[2] process, I'd like to welcome - should he choose to accept it - Tom Most to be a member of the Twisted project.  You've probably seen him around on IRC, as 'twm'.  Tom's been reporting nuanced web-related bugs in Twisted since at least 2011, if not longer: https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5434 <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5434>

Tom has been around in the Twisted community for the last few years, and he's been particularly helpful in some recent discussions around correct behavior with respect to various web standards, and participation in Treq and Klein.  He's been stalled a number of times by not having commit access, so: no more excuses, now.

Tom, please read https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CommitterCheckList <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CommitterCheckList> and then go do some code reviews :).

Message-ID: <FDB99B9F-64AE-43E7-8028-E551A0B984ED@twistedmatrix.com>

Hello Twisted Community,

Since I changed jobs, maintaining Twisted is no longer one of my formal professional responsibilities.  There have also been a number of recent events in my personal life which have reduced the amount of free time that I have, and impending changes that will reduce it even further.

This doesn't mean that I won't be contributing to Twisted at all as part of my job (in fact I probably have something coming later this month), just that since I no longer work for an infrastructure provider, "open source qua open source" is no longer part of the job description.

As such, I've been contributing to Twisted somewhat less lately, and I expect that contribution to further decline at least for a while.

Rather than this just resulting in an overall decrease in activity, I wanted to send an explicit message asking the community for help, to try to use this as an opportunity.  In the past, when prominent members of the project (myself included) have stepped back, others have stepped in to fill the void, and this has often been the catalyst for significant community growth.  However, this has always been a slow, organic process, because core project members (again, myself included) haven't always been clear about when they were going to be active.

So, if you are wondering, "what can I do for Twisted"?

If you area already a commit member with repo:write, you know what to do.  Get cracking.
Reply to this message.  Let's get a conversation going.  Maybe someone else has some good ideas.
Check out https://twisted.reviews <https://twisted.reviews/>.  The one advantage of remaining on Trac (as opposed to moving fully to Github) is that you can see at a glance, by looking at which rows are not greyed out on that report, what tickets that you have the ability to submit an authoritative code review for.  The rule is: external contributors can review stuff submitted by project members.
Our main hosted machine now supports Docker!  Volunteer for some operational responsibilities, or move more of our infrastructure into containers so that more of the maintenance work can be reliably tested by folks without permissions to access the actual infra.  Have a look over at https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid>.
Everyone's favorite owl also seems to have been somewhat more busy with non-Twisted stuff of late: volunteer to be a release manager to keep our pace of releases up!
Finish porting us to Python 3.  We are very, very close: http://blog.habnab.it/twisted-depgraph/ <http://blog.habnab.it/twisted-depgraph/>

Looking forward to see what y'all can do in my (mostly) absence,

That's a sad thing, seeing I was getting used to reading you
_everywhere_. But I highly appreciate your forwardness and specially you
paving the way for your somewhat stepping down!

I _was_ wondering "what can I do for Twisted?"! So I'm shamelessly
applying your number 2 and adding to the list what I have noticed.

Please note: I mean any critiques in the most constructive way and out
of the respect I have for the team and the love I've grown to have for
the framework.

7. Documentation *needs* an update. This goes mainly for everything that
can be found on twistedmatrix.com. And very specifically for the
developer docs. As a symptom: I don't recall having seen any reference
to the "twisted.reviews" domain anywhere! Right now, the project depends
heavily on _a lot_ of implicit knowledge, which is quite frustrating for
newcomers (hi!).

8. The website has to be restructured. Some things _are_ there,
somewhere, documented in some obscure wiki page linked to from some wiki
page three levels deep. As an anecdotal, but surely representative
example: I've spent hours in Twisted's docs and webpage and right now
I'm reading the DocumentationAnalysis page [1] for the first time.
I think the essence expressed in [1] is critical for the future of the
project, yet besides existing and having an email without replies on the
mailing list [2], that's all there is to it.
Stuff like this has to be more prominent!

9. A clear path for Contribution has to be established. Yes, there is
Wiki page dedicated to that but I think it can be improved a lot.
As, again an anecdotal but representative example: I've been trying to
fix #9100 [3] [4] it's an easy one (that's why I picked it), yet even
when reading the documentation for contributors, I missed a few things
that have complicated the process. And here is the thing: I am actively
trying! This basically means, if somebody sees a bug in Twisted that is
easy to fix, they won't. Or they will, it just won't end up reaching
Twisted's trunk.
Moving the load away from core developers starts by making the
contributing process easier for external contributors, with Glyph kind
of gone, this will be even more important (0.8 core contributors less!).
The following is based on the PR for #9100 [4] and  a couple others [5]
[6], from the POV of an external contributor:
- Bug is reported
- Bug is fixed by someone
- PR is made
- Comments are made
- Comments are discussed / implemented
- Stuff works
- PR remains open without further comments.
- External contributor forgets about Twisted and moves on or waits
indefinitely, while they could be fixing more stuff.

This could be because of a lack of active core-developers, which leads
me to:

10. "Project Governance", which has already been indirectly raised by
Glyph this week when presenting Tom Most (welcome, and thanks!).
Who works on twisted? When? Are they active? Partially active? What do
they do? What needs to be worked on? How does Twisted as an organisation
work? All of these are questions that don't seem too important when it
comes to code, but they extremely relevant when it comes to the project
and when it comes to users deciding Twisted over other options.
I explain further: if person A at company X uses Twisted and they have
the feeling, that Core-Developers are overwhelmed, person A could put
pressure in company X to get some of their time going to helping out in
Twisted. But if they don't know this, they can't. And if they knew this,
how would they?
Notice that I said "uses Twisted", Twisted is quite mature and it is
very possible to use it for a long time without hitting bugs. That's why
the health of the project (as opposed to the code) needs to be visible
from the outside, to non Twisted developers (either core or external).

11. Twistedchecker: from what I've been reading in open PRs, right now
it may be doing more harm than good. What's the coding standard?
testAll? test_all? Twistedchecker says something, documentation says
nothing. Core developer says something different. What About newlines?
Same issue. This is also a key point in getting stuff done by non-core
developers; if they can't trust the tools to help them produce a worthy
patch, why bother? As a side question: do core-developers use
twistedchecker? I would have imagined these issues would have resulted
on bug tickets that do not (yet) exist.

12. Bug discussion integration between Github and Trac? Discussion about
bugs is taken place on GitHub. At least about bugs someone is working
on. This makes sense, since the workflow involves a PR and GH makes
reviewing easier, that's where it ends being discussed. Why is this a
problem? Well, anyone who is not familiar with Twisted's development
will judge this from Trac:
- Oldest bug is #50. Open for nearly 16 years.
- There is nearly no discussion on newer bugs.
- Bugs that get closed, have usually no discussion.
- Therefore, users are being neglected.
That's, of course, an exaggeration and over-simplification; but the
point stands for outsiders. Some integration could mitigate that.

That being said, I could help with some things for a few hours a week. I
just... you know, can't.
I guess, since I'm hijacking threads, I might as well go all-in and ask
for Wiki edit permissions to begin with.

PS: This email got so long, my bread was burning in the oven! Sorry
about that, but I hope it is somehow beneficial.

Message-ID: <CAEeXt4P86U5Ry_9QfmXSHmDC080cebzK+H+BR4On_BDEBuPCqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm pleased to announce the release of txAWS 0.3.0.  txAWS is a library for
interacting with
Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Twisted.

You can download the release from PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txAWS>
 (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txAWS).

txAWS development uses GitHub for issues and source control
<https://github.com/twisted/txaws> (https://github.com/twisted/txaws).

Since the last release, the following enhancements have been made:

   - Jean-Paul Calderone added basic Route53 support.
   - Mark Williams add Auth v4, now used by the S3 and Route53 support.
   - Francisco Souza added support for VPCs to some EC2 APIs.
   - Drew Smathers added multi-part S3 upload support.
   - Several people added other S3 client features such as pagination and
   streaming uploads.
   - *txaws.testing* now provides S3 and Route53 support.

Additionally, the following APIs have been deprecated:

   - The *client* attribute of *txaws.client.base.BaseQuery*
   - The *date* attribute of *txaws.s3.client.Query*

Thanks to everyone who contributed and to Least Authority Enterprises
<https://leastauthority.com/> (<https://leastauthority.com/>) for
sponsoring my work on this release.

Message-ID: <CAEeXt4PHtC9kGC-Qo4DoLqEJg0nCBZ3Lmm64naSnMAfXyW09vg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm pleased to announce the first release of txkube, a Twisted-based
library for interacting with Kubernetes using the HTTP API.

This release supports several of the most commonly used basic Kubernetes
objects, including Services, ConfigMaps, Deployments, ReplicaSets, and
Pods.  While Kubernetes has many, many more object kinds, this collection
of kinds already supports a very useful set of interactions.

Here is an example of txkube usage, taken from the README:

   from __future__ import print_function
   from twisted.internet.task import react

   from txkube import v1, network_kubernetes_from_context

   @react
   def main(reactor):
       k8s = network_kubernetes_from_context(reactor, u"minikube")
       client = k8s.client()
       d = client.list(v1.Namespace)
       d.addCallback(print)
       return d

You can download txkube from PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>.
You can contribute to its development on GitHub
<https://github.com/LeastAuthority/txkube>.

Thanks to Least Authority Enterprises <https://leastauthority.com/> for
sponsoring this development.

Thanks for the announcement!

I do have one question about txkube, since this comes up periodically in every higher-level networking layer, and it's a place where I think Twisted has some advantages over other HTTP clients: is there a way to specify custom trust roots, or construct a custom Agent to pass in to txkube?

There's another constructor for IKubernetesService
<https://github.com/LeastAuthority/txkube/blob/b2e81400e40989696f82cabfd575d5283f7180e8/src/txkube/_interface.py>,
network_kubernetes
<https://github.com/LeastAuthority/txkube/blob/b2e81400e40989696f82cabfd575d5283f7180e8/src/txkube/_network.py#L41-L56>.
It takes an IAgent.  So one can do:

    network_kubernetes(base_url=url, agent=Agent(contextFactory=...))

Does that approach fit with any emerging conventions for exposing this kind
of functionality?  I'd be happy to adapt it if there's a better pattern.

Also note that it's common for Kubernetes to be deployed with a self-signed
or other non-cartel certificate.  So even the API in the example,
network_kubernetes_from_context, doesn't trust the usual web-oriented
collection of CAs.  It only respects the certificate found in the local
Kubernetes configuration.  This means that there's another way to control
this - edit ~/.kube/config and put the desired CA certificate there.

I think that's the state of the art, and it's a good primitive to build upon. If something needs to change, it's not the way txkube (et. al.) accept their argument, but rather a function in Twisted somewhere that computes the Towers of Hanoi Agent-stacking solution that Treq contains: https://github.com/twisted/treq/blob/b436c6c89b3a1b7fb2ecb5300ae24bcbea20fad0/src/treq/client.py#L198-L217

> Also note that it's common for Kubernetes to be deployed with a self-signed or other non-cartel certificate.  So even the API in the example, network_kubernetes_from_context, doesn't trust the usual web-oriented collection of CAs.  It only respects the certificate found in the local Kubernetes configuration.  This means that there's another way to control this - edit ~/.kube/config and put the desired CA certificate there.

Cool.  Although this is actually exactly what I'd expect (as I would imagine most Kubernetes users) this behavior sounds like something that might be worth calling out in the README.

Hey! I don't know I should ask this question or not but as a beginner I
have to ask.
I have just started learn python network programming and fortunately found
such an amazing Twisted Framework. As a beginner I could not be able to
decide where to start I mean what should I make first using twisted
framework. I would be very thankful to you for guiding me.
Pardon me for bad english!

Welcome! Glad you found Twisted, it really is awesome!

I personally like telnet-like servers. They are very easy to make with 
the LineReceiver protocol (hint hint), and you can do a lot with them.

I guess the most basic one is some kind of echo server / client that 
simply echos back whatever you type.

For more help, don't forget the Twisted documentation and the examples 
therein on http://www.twistedmatrix.com

> Pardon me for bad english!

Not to worry at all, everyone is welcome.

If you want *telnet* then you should probably use *twisted.conch.telnet*.
It's a little bit more complicated than *LineReceiver* but it will actually
speak telnet for you.  LineReceiver will get you some simple line-oriented
interactions, though.

Ah, than you. I could never figure out how to make the proper 
TelnetProtocol to do anything useful, and line-based is all I've ever 
really needed.

Thank you for the tip though.

The module would certainly benefit from some prose documentation.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] txtorcon versioning
Message-ID: <864lxtmkzx.fsf@atlantis.meejah.ca>


I will soon release the next version of txtorcon with a ton of cool new
features. This will be called 0.19.0. More details: 

   http://timaq4ygg2iegci7.onion/releases.html

Going forward, versioning will switch to a "CalVer.org" variant. At one
point, I thought of breaking a few now-regrettable APIs.

However, I will not do this.

The next version after 0.19.0 will be 17.x.y
Changes in any existing APIs will be done by first introducing the new
thing, deprecating the old thing and eventually removing the old
thing. The new documentation's "programming guide" includes some notes
on API stability. I have not to date broken/changed any existing
API. Also at this point nothing is deprecated (but there are "preferred"
APIs).

The onion services APIs *will* change for the 17.x release.

New code should follow the recommendations in the programming
guide. Existing code will continue to work for the forseeable future.

thanks,
meejah

If you don't mind, could you describe your reasoning behind this decision?
I am always curious to learn any concrete reasons behind this. If this
seems spammy to the mailing list, please feel free to respond only to me.

Mostly because I don't want to ever have breaking changes, so then
you're "not supposed" to upgdate the big version number. I haven't found
that "semantic versioning" has been working very well for the
release-style of txtorcon.

Other, less important reasons: Twisted does this; it's easier to tell
"how new" a release is; and big version numbers are cool (just kidding).

Hi,

Moshe Zadka recently gave a very good presentation on using Twisted as a
WSGI container for Django or Flask apps at the San Francisco Django Meetup:

https://rawgit.com/moshez/talks/master/twist-wsgi/twist-wsgi.html

The examples in this presentation should be cleaned up and maybe put on the
front page of the twistedmatrix web site.  Many Python developers are using
frameworks like Django and Flask.  That would be a good way to get new
developers interested in Twisted.

Thank you, this looks very interesting.

As I was planning to ask a relevant question, let me add it here:

Are there any similar resources for other web frameworks, for example
Pyramid? And when I say resources, I mean talks, presentations or just a
web page with example code.

I think it would be helpful to have a page in the Twisted site, with links
to such resources - and perhaps a page for each (Django, Flask, Pyramid,
etc) with sample code and specific issues/tips than have been encountered
when combining Twisted with other frameworks.

"Hendrix" is a tool for running various frameworks under Twisted; I'm pretty sure Pyramid is one of them (although I don't have a direct link to pyramid-specific docs handy):

https://hendrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ <https://hendrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

For the most part, general WSGI documentation should get you most of the way there with specific frameworks though.  This used to be a lot worse but in recent years there's been a lot of convergence.

The Twisted site is a wiki, and if you are interested in curating such a page, I'm happy to give you the relevant edit permissions.

I have to disagree here BTW.  When I started using Twisted as a WSGI container, I was vexed by its lack of docs (and I’m still confused about many details).  There’s a few blog posts around but none of them reach the straight-forwardibility of e.g. gunicorn’s docs.  I’ve ended up asking around on IRC, stealing from Donald/PyPI, and reading source code.

I honestly believe, we’re leaving money on the table here.  Using Twisted as a WSGI container should be first class use case on the web page since it presents a nice entry drug into the ecosystem.

There’s also barely any information on *why* one would want to use Twisted as a WSGI container.  And please keep in mind that to many, many (most likely: the majority) of Python users “pure Python” doesn’t mean “safe” but “slow.” C.f. all those “lightning fast pure C” frameworks popping up left and right, upvoted to nirvana on reddit and its likes.   If we want to do marketing, we have to be a tad more user-focused. :)

What I’m saying is that this topic shouldn’t be relegated into some wiki (where information famously is going to die) but should be a prominent tab on the landing page (maybe with additional information for specific frameworks in the wiki).

Message-ID: <CACyevsWjNPeuahTn3WU1yVOi8thL+ex6Q6o03S8ea146=i5Rhg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm taking Glyph's suggestion and bringing this to the mailing list. :)

I still believe it was unwise to remove the support for the extra EC curves
in PR #749 for a few reasons that I've said in a few different places so
I'll summarize them here.

*  Support for more curves is better.  It gives more options to users and
developers such as myself who want to use Twisted for custom environments.
All of this widens the support base.

*  These are all curves suggested in RFC 5656, and I believe the more
Twisted supports the RFC the better.

*  There are cases for using alternative curves.  NIST-T-571 is stronger
than any of the currently supported curves.  NIST-K-163 is weaker, but
there are still uses for it. I may be working in an embedded environment
where every CPU cycle counts and I just need simple encryption to protect
against simple plain text scanning.

* Having extra curves does not make Twisted less secure.  SSH negotiates
encryption based on a list of preferred ciphers.  We put the strongest
ciphers first and the weaker curves only get used if nothing better is
available where weak encryption is still better than no encryption.

There are other reasons why I think it makes sense to have the curves in
Twisted but these are the main ones.

Message-ID: <CAEeXt4OFr+wN0iPjqQSL+n4N+MiM_9-dFLncXtHt5DQV4bVh_g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm pleased to announce the initial release of kubetop, a command-line tool
in the style of top(1) for displaying current usage and activity of a
Kubernetes cluster.

kubetop 17.4.17.1 will format information about your Kubernetes cluster
like this:

kubetop - 13:02:57
Node 0 CPU%   9.80 MEM% 57.97 (   2 GiB/   4 GiB)  POD%  7.27 (  8/110) Ready
Node 1 CPU%  21.20 MEM% 59.36 (   2 GiB/   4 GiB)  POD%  3.64 (  4/110) Ready
Node 2 CPU%  99.90 MEM% 58.11 (   2 GiB/   4 GiB)  POD%  7.27 (  8/110) Ready
Pods:       20 total        0 running        0 terminating        0 pending
                 POD               (CONTAINER)        %CPU         MEM   %MEM

                        (subscription-manager)         0.0   91.62 MiB
                       (foolscap-log-gatherer)         0.0   21.98 MiB

                              (wormhole-relay)         0.0   22.19 MiB


kubetop is meant as a handy tool to use at the spur of the moment.  It is
not intended to replace a real monitoring system.

kubetop's presentation is preliminary and a work in progress.
Contributions welcome.

You can find kubetop on PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/kubetop> and
GitHub <https://github.com/LeastAuthority/kubetop>.  Install it in the
usual way:

pip install kubetop


Thanks to Least Authority Enterprises <https://leastauthority.com/> for
sponsoring this development.

Hi,

I do think letting users configure the permissible curves (and their 
priority) using a public tx API, and exposing all of the curves that the 
underlying openssl provides is important.

FWIW, the german BSI (a state IT security institute that provides 
recommendations, and certifications) now recommends:

brainpoolP256r1, brainpoolP384r1, brainpoolP512r1

and only if none of these is avail, falls back to

secp256r1, secp384r1

Page 15 (3.6.1) here:

https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/TechnischeRichtlinien/TR02102/BSI-TR-02102-2.pdf?__blob=publicationFile

--

Currently, eg Crossbar.io is using secp256r1 (not configurable)

https://github.com/crossbario/crossbar/blob/master/crossbar/twisted/tlsctx.py#L331
https://github.com/crossbario/crossbar/blob/master/crossbar/twisted/tlsctx.py#L206

and we would like to move to a configurable, maintainable solution.

Cheers,
/Tobias

Also agreed here.

Yep.  And things like Moshe's talk are wonderful resources to try to illuminate this unfortunately dark area, so I do appreciate people taking the time to do them.  I do also think that being a bit more strategic about it might result in vastly greater adoption though.

The front page is also the wiki :-).  I'm happy to have it there, I just think that it should perhaps be workshopped a little bit on a draft page first.

Personally I'm not using Kubernetes much, but this looks SUPER handy.  And it seems to install cleanly with `pipsi install kubetop` :-).  Thanks for the announcement!

I did see this in my install output though:

  Running setup.py bdist_wheel for attr ... done
  Stored in directory: /Users/glyph/Library/Caches/pip/wheels/39/a7/44/cce905c824a2266d3e5747b2de72c8d73f9c8e9f0a71f066cd

Is this actually supposed to depend on https://pypi.python.org/pypi/attr <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/attr> ?  It seems likely to me that this was a typo somewhere in the dependency chain for https://pypi.python.org/pypi/attrs <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/attrs> .

Thank you :).  Hopefully some people more qualified than me will comment...

> I still believe it was unwise to remove the support for the extra EC curves in PR #749 for a few reasons that I've said in a few different places so I'll summarize them here.

I have some arguments with the form of your argument here, but I should emphasize that I don't know enough about the specific underlying crypto to go one way or another - mostly I'm trusting the opinions of Alex Gaynor, and your counterpoints are not convincing (yet).

> *  Support for more curves is better.  It gives more options to users and developers such as myself who want to use Twisted for custom environments.  All of this widens the support base.

Not necessarily.  Support for more curves may allow or encourage the use of insecure curves by naive users.

> *  These are all curves suggested in RFC 5656, and I believe the more Twisted supports the RFC the better.

RFC 5656 is very old.  Specifically: pre-heartbleed, pre-snowden, pre-BULLRUN revelations.  Just because it's in that RFC is not a compelling argument for its inclusion.

> *  There are cases for using alternative curves.  NIST-T-571 is stronger than any of the currently supported curves.  NIST-K-163 is weaker, but there are still uses for it. I may be working in an embedded environment where every CPU cycle counts and I just need simple encryption to protect against simple plain text scanning.

These types of use-cases do not require these curves to be enabled by conch by default.  They just require there being a public API to enable these things.

> * Having extra curves does not make Twisted less secure.

If they are enabled by default, it very well can.

> SSH negotiates encryption based on a list of preferred ciphers.  We put the strongest ciphers first and the weaker curves only get used if nothing better is available where weak encryption is still better than no encryption.

Or if an adversary successfully executes a downgrade attack.

There's downgrade detection in SSH, but we shouldn't rely on it to be perfect.

> There are other reasons why I think it makes sense to have the curves in Twisted but these are the main ones.

I think it might be more productive to argue for the inclusion of individual curves on a case-by-case basis.  "should it be included at all" and "should it be enabled by default" are also separate questions.

Yeah, I didn’t actually mean to disagree as much as use it as an opportunity to voice something that has been brewing in me for a while. :)

Yeah Moshe’s evangelism made me interested in the topic but it’s hard to find anything more than his material.  Particularly a good reference guide.  As you wrote, the particular integration with web frameworks is trivial (but should be provided!)

Heh absolutely.  Just wanna stress that it should come right after “Web Server” in the “Code Examples” tabs. :)

Oh and I’d like to propose to officially merge the twisted-web mailing list into this one.  I don’t think it makes any sense to separate those two anymore.  It’s hard to do anything without web nowadays. :)

Oops!  Thanks for pointing that out.  It is indeed a mistake.

I'm definitely inclined to agree about this. I don't think it's had enough independent activity to justify its continued existence.  The perceived need for a separate list was a cultural feature of an earlier time :).

I think if you log in you should be able to create and edit most pages, although the front page will be locked.  Let me know if that is not the case.

Glyph, I understand your and other's concerns, and while clearly I feel a
little differently, my real concern was how the curves I was using were
suddenly not supported at all. Which is why I think the API you and Tobias
suggested is a good compromise.

I have the code to do this just about ready and will submit a ticket and PR
shortly.

I'm still a little unclear as to why you were specifically using these curves, which I think informs this discussion somewhat :).  For example, if you're testing with intentionally weak curves then we should be putting these behind an API that is as awkward to use as possible :).

> I have the code to do this just about ready and will submit a ticket and PR shortly.

Cool.  Hopefully our cryptographers in residence will have no issue with an API that you have to call to specifically enable these.

If someone was not dedicated to Twisted, why would they even bother going
through all the steps that you did to
figure out how to use Twisted as a WSGI container?  I'm amazed that even
you did not give up. :)

Do you have any idea how Twisted fares in performance benchmarks of WSGI
containers?
Moshe's presentation didn't cover this, and I forgot to ask him at the
presentation.
I also couldn't find any WSGI benchmarks which included Twisted.

Do be honest, it probably doesn't do all that well.  Making the container multi-process (as Moshe notes) would be a good first step to getting something worth benchmarking.

But, I should note, the obsession with benchmarks in WSGI containers is a symptom of a generally industry-wide lack of understanding of good performance analysis.  The fastest WSGI container is probably 2% of your application's overhead; the slowest possible one, maybe 3%.  The differences look huge when you're comparing servers against each other, but throw a real application and a database and some load balancer latency in there and the app server container utterly disappears.  Even multi-process support isn't really about optimizing for performance (although certainly leveraging multiple cores helps), it's about being able to safely crash a WSGI container process without bringing down the whole server.

I left a comment on that ticket forwarding the straightforward fix that can
be applied to BuildBot to address this problem.

It's certainly true that there are shortcomings in the spawnProcess API so
I won't try to argue that this *isn't* a problem in Twisted.  However, some
of those very problems make it difficult to *fix* any of the problems.  It
seems more likely that spawnProcess will eventually be replaced by a better
API (if the problems are ever fixed at all, that is).  Meanwhile, since the
fix in BuildBot is quite simple, that seems like a good direction to pursue.

spawnProcess may remain a useful primitive for something higher-level, or it might be replaced, but there has been some discussion of what that might be for quite some time:

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2415 <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2415>

Getting some new momentum on that ticket would be good.

Message-ID: <86tw5ijn0j.fsf@atlantis.meejah.ca>


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I'm very happy to release txtorcon 0.19.0. This merges most of the
development that happened over the last several months on the
release-1.x branch. Featuring:

 * Full Python3 support (and universal wheels)

 * Drop txsocksx and use a custom implementation (this also implements
   the custom Tor SOCKS5 methods RESOLVE and RESOLVE_PTR). Uses
   Automat for the state-machine.

 * Drop support for older Twisted releases (12, 13 and 14 are no
   longer supported).

 * Add a top-level API object (txtorcon.Tor) that abstracts a running
   Tor. Instances of this class are created with txtorcon.connect or
   txtorcon.launch. These instances are intended to be "the"
   high-level API and most users shouldn't need anything else.

 * Integrated support for twisted.web.client.Agent, baked into
   txtorcon.Tor. This allows simple, straightforward use of treq or
   "raw" twisted.web.client for making client-type Web requests via
   Tor. Automatically handles configuration of SOCKS ports.

 * new high-level API for putting streams on specific Circuits. This
   adds txtorcon.Circuit.stream_via and txtorcon.Circuit.web_agent
   methods that work the same as the "Tor" equivalent methods except
   they use a specific circuit. This makes
   txtorcon.TorState.set_attacher the "low-level" / "expert"
   interface. Most users should only need the new API.

 * big revamp / re-write of the documentation, including the new
   Programming Guide:
   https://txtorcon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html

 * Issue 203: https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon/issues/203

 * new helper: txtorcon.Router.get_onionoo_details which downloads
   JSON for a particular relay from OnionOO

 * new helper: txtorcon.util.create_tbb_web_headers which returns
   headers resembling a recent Tor Browser suitable for use with
   Twisted or treq web agents.

 * Issue 72: https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon/issues/72

 * Specific SocksError subclasses for all the available SOCKS5 errors
   added by https://github.com/felipedau

 * (more) Python3 fixes from https://github.com/rodrigc

You can download the release from PyPI or GitHub (or of course "pip
install txtorcon"):

   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txtorcon/0.19.0
   https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon/releases/tag/v0.19.0

Releases are also available from the hidden service:

   http://timaq4ygg2iegci7.onion/txtorcon-0.19.0.tar.gz.asc

You can verify the sha256sum of both by running the following 4 lines
in a shell wherever you have the files downloaded:

cat <<EOF | sha256sum --check

As per our previously documented entirely arbitrary[1] and ad-hoc[2] process, I'd like to welcome - should he choose to accept it - Tom Most to be a member of the Twisted project.  You've probably seen him around on IRC, as 'twm'.  Tom's been reporting nuanced web-related bugs in Twisted since at least 2011, if not longer: https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5434 <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5434>

Tom has been around in the Twisted community for the last few years, and he's been particularly helpful in some recent discussions around correct behavior with respect to various web standards, and participation in Treq and Klein.  He's been stalled a number of times by not having commit access, so: no more excuses, now.

Tom, please read https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CommitterCheckList <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CommitterCheckList> and then go do some code reviews :).

Hello Twisted Community,

Since I changed jobs, maintaining Twisted is no longer one of my formal professional responsibilities.  There have also been a number of recent events in my personal life which have reduced the amount of free time that I have, and impending changes that will reduce it even further.

This doesn't mean that I won't be contributing to Twisted at all as part of my job (in fact I probably have something coming later this month), just that since I no longer work for an infrastructure provider, "open source qua open source" is no longer part of the job description.

As such, I've been contributing to Twisted somewhat less lately, and I expect that contribution to further decline at least for a while.

Rather than this just resulting in an overall decrease in activity, I wanted to send an explicit message asking the community for help, to try to use this as an opportunity.  In the past, when prominent members of the project (myself included) have stepped back, others have stepped in to fill the void, and this has often been the catalyst for significant community growth.  However, this has always been a slow, organic process, because core project members (again, myself included) haven't always been clear about when they were going to be active.

So, if you are wondering, "what can I do for Twisted"?

If you area already a commit member with repo:write, you know what to do.  Get cracking.
Reply to this message.  Let's get a conversation going.  Maybe someone else has some good ideas.
Check out https://twisted.reviews <https://twisted.reviews/>.  The one advantage of remaining on Trac (as opposed to moving fully to Github) is that you can see at a glance, by looking at which rows are not greyed out on that report, what tickets that you have the ability to submit an authoritative code review for.  The rule is: external contributors can review stuff submitted by project members.
Our main hosted machine now supports Docker!  Volunteer for some operational responsibilities, or move more of our infrastructure into containers so that more of the maintenance work can be reliably tested by folks without permissions to access the actual infra.  Have a look over at https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid>.
Everyone's favorite owl also seems to have been somewhat more busy with non-Twisted stuff of late: volunteer to be a release manager to keep our pace of releases up!
Finish porting us to Python 3.  We are very, very close: http://blog.habnab.it/twisted-depgraph/ <http://blog.habnab.it/twisted-depgraph/>

Looking forward to see what y'all can do in my (mostly) absence,

That's a sad thing, seeing I was getting used to reading you
_everywhere_. But I highly appreciate your forwardness and specially you
paving the way for your somewhat stepping down!

I _was_ wondering "what can I do for Twisted?"! So I'm shamelessly
applying your number 2 and adding to the list what I have noticed.

Please note: I mean any critiques in the most constructive way and out
of the respect I have for the team and the love I've grown to have for
the framework.

7. Documentation *needs* an update. This goes mainly for everything that
can be found on twistedmatrix.com. And very specifically for the
developer docs. As a symptom: I don't recall having seen any reference
to the "twisted.reviews" domain anywhere! Right now, the project depends
heavily on _a lot_ of implicit knowledge, which is quite frustrating for
newcomers (hi!).

8. The website has to be restructured. Some things _are_ there,
somewhere, documented in some obscure wiki page linked to from some wiki
page three levels deep. As an anecdotal, but surely representative
example: I've spent hours in Twisted's docs and webpage and right now
I'm reading the DocumentationAnalysis page [1] for the first time.
I think the essence expressed in [1] is critical for the future of the
project, yet besides existing and having an email without replies on the
mailing list [2], that's all there is to it.
Stuff like this has to be more prominent!

9. A clear path for Contribution has to be established. Yes, there is
Wiki page dedicated to that but I think it can be improved a lot.
As, again an anecdotal but representative example: I've been trying to
fix #9100 [3] [4] it's an easy one (that's why I picked it), yet even
when reading the documentation for contributors, I missed a few things
that have complicated the process. And here is the thing: I am actively
trying! This basically means, if somebody sees a bug in Twisted that is
easy to fix, they won't. Or they will, it just won't end up reaching
Twisted's trunk.
Moving the load away from core developers starts by making the
contributing process easier for external contributors, with Glyph kind
of gone, this will be even more important (0.8 core contributors less!).
The following is based on the PR for #9100 [4] and  a couple others [5]
[6], from the POV of an external contributor:
- Bug is reported
- Bug is fixed by someone
- PR is made
- Comments are made
- Comments are discussed / implemented
- Stuff works
- PR remains open without further comments.
- External contributor forgets about Twisted and moves on or waits
indefinitely, while they could be fixing more stuff.

This could be because of a lack of active core-developers, which leads
me to:

10. "Project Governance", which has already been indirectly raised by
Glyph this week when presenting Tom Most (welcome, and thanks!).
Who works on twisted? When? Are they active? Partially active? What do
they do? What needs to be worked on? How does Twisted as an organisation
work? All of these are questions that don't seem too important when it
comes to code, but they extremely relevant when it comes to the project
and when it comes to users deciding Twisted over other options.
I explain further: if person A at company X uses Twisted and they have
the feeling, that Core-Developers are overwhelmed, person A could put
pressure in company X to get some of their time going to helping out in
Twisted. But if they don't know this, they can't. And if they knew this,
how would they?
Notice that I said "uses Twisted", Twisted is quite mature and it is
very possible to use it for a long time without hitting bugs. That's why
the health of the project (as opposed to the code) needs to be visible
from the outside, to non Twisted developers (either core or external).

11. Twistedchecker: from what I've been reading in open PRs, right now
it may be doing more harm than good. What's the coding standard?
testAll? test_all? Twistedchecker says something, documentation says
nothing. Core developer says something different. What About newlines?
Same issue. This is also a key point in getting stuff done by non-core
developers; if they can't trust the tools to help them produce a worthy
patch, why bother? As a side question: do core-developers use
twistedchecker? I would have imagined these issues would have resulted
on bug tickets that do not (yet) exist.

12. Bug discussion integration between Github and Trac? Discussion about
bugs is taken place on GitHub. At least about bugs someone is working
on. This makes sense, since the workflow involves a PR and GH makes
reviewing easier, that's where it ends being discussed. Why is this a
problem? Well, anyone who is not familiar with Twisted's development
will judge this from Trac:
- Oldest bug is #50. Open for nearly 16 years.
- There is nearly no discussion on newer bugs.
- Bugs that get closed, have usually no discussion.
- Therefore, users are being neglected.
That's, of course, an exaggeration and over-simplification; but the
point stands for outsiders. Some integration could mitigate that.

That being said, I could help with some things for a few hours a week. I
just... you know, can't.
I guess, since I'm hijacking threads, I might as well go all-in and ask
for Wiki edit permissions to begin with.

PS: This email got so long, my bread was burning in the oven! Sorry
about that, but I hope it is somehow beneficial.
