Somehow, I feel as though the God of Ethical and Intelligent Marketing 
Practices is posting to this mailing list.

Yes.  This is definitely not a good idea.

First of all, do we really want to attract managers who are swayed by 
glossy brochure marketing material?  We have a top-notch user community 
at the moment, and I know there are a lot of really interesting 
projects going on in the Twistedverse; while it is certainly tempting 
to attempt Total World Domination (TM), eliminating PHP/mod_perl/your 
favorite sucky web technology, the only real benefit is enabling smart 
people who work for stupid people to have a good time.

We could always use improvement of our technical documentation, but I 
think that as a technical community, we generally have a poor 
understanding of what makes the stereotypical bad manager's mind work.  
We need to be able to understand their legitimate concerns without 
caving in to their apparently irrational need for a security blanket of 
&quot;web services&quot; and &quot;b2b p2p&quot; and &quot;enterprise ready&quot;.

I have a feeling that if we _did_ try to produce such a website, the 
resulting material would sound indistinguishable (to our ears) from the 
average industry rag advertisement, but that it would feel vaguely 
insulting to the people we were trying to reach, because it would be an 
unintentional parody of that style.
