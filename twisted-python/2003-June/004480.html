Great to hear it!

</I>&gt;<i> the Twisted way, and my thoughts on how to fix it.  Comments and
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions are welcome.
</I>
I'll try to give you a brief survey.

&gt;<i> * The application: Hep should be a .tap-able twisted plugin.
</I>
As Moshe says, this should be super-easy.  Not much more to say here.

&gt;<i> * The web server: The current code is Hep CVS is an excellent example 
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> what happens when you write Twisted.web code without understanding how
</I>&gt;<i> Resources work.
</I>
Yup.  That seems to be the case.

&gt;<i> Please refrain from commenting on just how bad it is -
</I>
Sorry, couldn't resist.

OMG IT IS SO BAD LOLOLOLOL

&gt;<i> I started rewriting the web interface in Woven this weekend, so this
</I>&gt;<i> should be fixed soon :-)
</I>
Cool.  Much as it's improved, Woven needs more deployments to help it 
with polish :-)

&gt;<i> * Users and authentication:  I have a vague idea that I should be using
</I>&gt;<i> Perspectives and/or Cred for authenticating users and accessing user
</I>&gt;<i> data.  Currently each server in Hep does the work of authentication and
</I>&gt;<i> setting up user access.  It would be nice to have this centralized, so
</I>&gt;<i> you could (for example) see which users are currently connected to Hep.
</I>
Itamar and my aforementioned rewrite will help you with this.  Stall 
this a few weeks, and there should be good documentation on how to do 
it.

&gt;<i> * The SMTP server: Currently going through a rewrite in CVS.  I need to
</I>&gt;<i> set up code to manage the outgoing message queue, and keep track of
</I>&gt;<i> which messages have been delivered to which locations.  Is there code 
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> twisted.mail to do this? (Keep in mind some messages are being 
</I>&gt;<i> delivered
</I>&gt;<i> to blogs and other non-SMTP locations)
</I>
I need to rewrite twisted.words to accomodate use-cases like this at 
some point; however, it keeps falling off the end of my queue.  It 
certainly wouldn't be a good idea to wait for me to come up with that, 
but in a few months we should re-group and see if we can refactor the 
code that we've both written into some generally useful core 
abstraction.

&gt;<i> I think that just about covers it... Thoughts?
</I>
Sounds like a good laundry list.  I would be interested to know where 
and if you hit any snags, even if you get past them on your own - I'd 
love to see a paper or something about this.  It would really be nice 
to show to other application authors who are struggling with the same 
sort of issues.  I even have a tentative title - &quot;Submitting to the 
hive mind for fun and profit - making your project Twisted-friendly 
even though you don't want to&quot;.  What do you think? :)
