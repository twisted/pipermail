  Cool!

  Hmm, this is the only part of the patch I am unsure about.  The API seems
a little too tuned to your use-case.  I think the way to go for this would
be to have a Producer passed in and make the NNTP protocol a Consumer
for that (in turn acting as a Producer for its transport object).  Would you
be willing to make this change? (If you need an example of how this might
work, check out smtp.py)

&gt;<i> There is one somewhat- incompatible change here, in that I return the GROUP 
</I>&gt;<i> results (article count, high and low numbers) as integers, not as text. In 
</I>&gt;<i> practice they're going to be int()ized anyway, so this should not be a

  I think this is fine.

  Thanks for these test fixes/cleanups, too.

In the days when Sussman was a novice Minsky once came to him as he sat
hacking at the PDP-6. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; asked Minsky. &quot;I am training a
randomly wired neural net to play Tic-Tac-Toe.&quot; &quot;Why is the net wired
randomly?&quot; asked Minsky. &quot;I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how
to play.&quot; Minsky shut his eyes. &quot;Why do you close your eyes?&quot; Sussman asked
his teacher. &quot;So the room will be empty.&quot; At that moment, Sussman was
enlightened.
