  Close -- the directory won't be added to the seen-directory-cache unless
it also contains a file named &quot;plugins.tml&quot;.  It is true that it is added to
this cache even if it does not contain __init__.py.  This is to keep it from
taking one hundred million years to run (if it checked to see if it was a
package in Python's eyes, it would need to do between 1 and 6 extra
os.path.exists() calls: utterly unacceptable in terms of performance).

In the days when Sussman was a novice Minsky once came to him as he sat
hacking at the PDP-6. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; asked Minsky. &quot;I am training a
randomly wired neural net to play Tic-Tac-Toe.&quot; &quot;Why is the net wired
randomly?&quot; asked Minsky. &quot;I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how
to play.&quot; Minsky shut his eyes. &quot;Why do you close your eyes?&quot; Sussman asked
his teacher. &quot;So the room will be empty.&quot; At that moment, Sussman was
enlightened.
