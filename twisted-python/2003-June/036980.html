The bottom line: it should be dead easy. I recommend also reading
the &quot;application&quot; document. Also, there's no documentation for
ApplicationService, but there are lots of time where ApplicationServices
are the correct way to share information between services. The source
(and the API reference) is the best documentation here. Of course,
as always, more documentation would be appreciated.
 
&gt;<i> * The SMTP server: Currently going through a rewrite in CVS.  I need to

</I>&gt;<i> to blogs and other non-SMTP locations)
</I>
twisted.mail is also going a rewrite, so I'd wait for Jp to comment.
Note that again, ApplicationService may be a nice thing here, especially
if it's data that you *could* recover from the messages themselves on
startup. Otherwise, it is better to look into some safer persistence
strategy such as dirdbm or world (although world is fairly unstable).

Bottom line: put configuration data in the Application, share configuration
between multiple servers via ApplicationServices, put non-critical data
in ApplicationServices and critical data in safer formats like databases.
