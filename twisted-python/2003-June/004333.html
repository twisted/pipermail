No -- see below.

You're misunderstanding the purpose of Deferreds.  They don't do any magic
to make blocking calls happen asynchronously.

A Deferred is simply a result that hasn't arrived yet.  When the result of
some function can take some arbitrary amount of time to happen, it will
return a Deferred, rather than holding up the execution of the rest of the
program.  A Deferred is a promise that a result (or failure) will arrive
eventually, and provides a convenient abstraction to attach callbacks to
that is far more usuable than riddling your code with functions that take a
method to callback when they're done.

How the result arrives later is entirely up to the code that returns the
Deferred.  It might simply send an HTTP request, and wait for the result to
arrive off the network; it might query a database; it might split the work
up into small chunks that it schedules using callLater; or it might just use
deferToThread.  All that matters is that at some point &quot;d.callback(result)&quot;
or &quot;d.errback(failure)&quot; is called (or you could call d.setTimeout(...) if
you aren't sure you want to wait indefinitely).

Does this make sense?

Regards,

-Andrew.
