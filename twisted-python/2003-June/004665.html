  Yea, it isn't perfect.

  They can complete in any order because the code responsible for the
Deferred's callback must buffer the message in memory.

</I>
  At the very least, the object that is currently a string should become a
file object (This should have minimal impact on your code -- if buffering in
memory is acceptable to you, you only have to build a StringIO object from
your string), and the NNTP protocol class should consume it in a manner
similar to that of smtp.py.  It -does- seem that this is becoming a common
task (smtp.py and pop3.py do it, imap4.py needs to do, and now nntp.py), so
maybe I'll write a utility mixin to help out, and I'll see if I can
generalize it away from just file-like objects too.

  This gives clients at least the opportunity to avoid loading entire
messages into memory, which is what I am looking for.  Am I right in
thinking this leaves you with all the functionality you want?
