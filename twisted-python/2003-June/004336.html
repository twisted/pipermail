All backwards compatability has to be in the Request class interfaces -
whatever stuff a end user might be using.

&gt;<i> What about using just rfc822.Message?  That's in Python 2.2.
</I>
Not good enough - MIME stuff should be stored on disk if its large (i.e.
file uploads). I did it using cgi.FieldStorage, and it was backwards
compatible too, but it broke twisted.web.distrib, which *sucked* :(
distrib needs to be fixed so it gets a stream, and then we can mess with
Request as much as we want.

&gt;<i> I used the wrong term.  I said &quot;replacement&quot; when I should have

</I>&gt;<i> isn't out yet!)
</I>
I'd have to see the code before deciding.

&gt;<i> My major complaint, by the way, is not that there are small problems
</I>&gt;<i> with the code.  It's that Twisted duplicates functionality from
</I>&gt;<i> standard Python, when the Python code is just as usable for that
</I>&gt;<i> situation and has fewer problems.  And going the other way, the Python
</I>&gt;<i> 2.3 implementation
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have the &quot;\r\n&quot; workaround Twisted has for handling IE
</I>&gt;<i> problems. If those could be combined, then there are more people
</I>&gt;<i> supporting the same
</I>&gt;<i> codebase, so hopefully fewer bugs, and easier to share experience 
</I>&gt;<i> between
</I>&gt;<i> the two.
</I>
A lot of this is for historical reasons - Twisted only depending on
1.5.2, and then 2.1. 2.2 support is really new.

&gt;<i> A downside is the dependency on Python releases to fix patches, but
</I>&gt;<i> any bugs at this point will be distributed at the patch level, and
</I>&gt;<i> there's always the possibility of just including the patched code
</I>&gt;<i> with Twisted until the next Python update.
</I>
Because we can release Twisted so much faster, we usually prefer to just
patch Twisted.

&gt;<i> &quot;Backwards compatible&quot; is somewhat of an issue.  I don't know which
</I>&gt;<i> methods are published and which are unpublished.  Is it expected that
</I>&gt;<i> people will (or do) derive from twisted.protocols.http.HTTPChannel ?
</I>&gt;<i> If so, then can I change the behaviour or simply eliminate the
</I>&gt;<i> headerReceived method?  (I would rather accumulate all headers then
</I>&gt;<i> parse them into a Message in one go.)  What about the other methods?
</I>
Request methods and attributes that users are likely to use is what
counts.
