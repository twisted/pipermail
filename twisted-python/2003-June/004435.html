I think it would be hacky because Woven spits out XML, not HTML. One
thing I tried the other day (as noted on this list) is using Woven to
spit out WML for my mobile phone, instead of HTML for my browser. WML
doesn't (as far as I know) have even the concept of block-vs-inline
elements. 

An XSLT engine I worked with once had several 'output modes' which
changed how it spat out data - if you set it to XML mode, it would
work as you expect. If you set it to text mode, I think it refused to
do XML-style entity references and escaping. And if you set it to HTML
mode, it would 'tidy up' some tags (&quot;&lt;hr/&gt;&quot; -&gt; &quot;&lt;hr&gt;&quot;, etc), and
pretty-print.

That's all very nice and useful, but I expect it would be a reasonable
amount of work - work that will only ever become less important as
time wears on and XHTML becomes more common. It's not a sufficiently
crucial feature for me to look into creating.
