I just spent some time looking playing with t.i.app. If I understand it
correctly, you run a bunch of services, each of which provides certain
functionality, and all of the services get registered with the
application.  So each service can access any of the other services like
so:

otherService = self.serviceParent.getServiceByName('otherService')

This is a really natural fit for Hep and looks easy as pie to
implement.  One question, though.  Say I run a server by creating a
Factory and running application.listenTCP(myFactory, port).  What's the
preferred way to access services from inside that Factory?

&gt;<i> twisted.mail is also going a rewrite, so I'd wait for Jp to comment.

Ok, I'll wait for Jp :)

&gt;<i> Note that again, ApplicationService may be a nice thing here, especially
</I>&gt;<i> if it's data that you *could* recover from the messages themselves on
</I>&gt;<i> startup. Otherwise, it is better to look into some safer persistence
</I>&gt;<i> strategy such as dirdbm or world (although world is fairly unstable).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bottom line: put configuration data in the Application, share configuration
</I>&gt;<i> between multiple servers via ApplicationServices, put non-critical data
</I>&gt;<i> in ApplicationServices and critical data in safer formats like databases.
</I>
The only variable that I think I'd want to maintain in the Application
is the location of it's data directory.  That way when the app starts it
knows where to look to find messages, user prefs, etc, and I can ditch
the hep.ini file.
