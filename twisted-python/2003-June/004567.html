Thanks for catching this. We should change the hack. The hack is so I 
can create and run a second TestSuite inside a UnitTest, so that the 
entire second TestSuite can run between the first UnitTest's setUp and 
tearDown. It's in Divmod/divmod/web/functionaltester.py

Feedback on how to do this better would be greatly appreciated...

I did run the tests before I checked in and it wasn't obvious that my 
changes had broken anything. There were broken tests, but I didn't 
realize they were my fault. Sorry.
