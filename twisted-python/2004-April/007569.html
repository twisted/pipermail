</I>&gt;<i> &gt;even though the name is changing, why is the new package &quot;lowdown&quot; and not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&quot;twisted.lowdown&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It was decided that doing package names like this would be too 
</I>&gt;<i> problematic. Unfortunately, Python isn't as cool as Java. The name was 
</I>&gt;<i> changed to lowdown because &quot;news&quot; is a bad top-level package name and 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;twistednews&quot; and &quot;tnews&quot; and various permutations so forth were also 
</I>&gt;<i> lame. Also, &quot;Low Down&quot; is cool. Get it? The LOW DOWN??? The NEWS??? Ha Ha!
</I>
I get the name, I just wanted to know why exactly it was chosen over other
names :)

What are the problems you allude to with keeping &quot;twisted.news&quot;?  I was
under the impression that Zope 3 is planning to go this route.

&gt;<i> &gt;I'm also interested to see that NNTP protocol support has also migrated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;to lowdown -- I was expecting that protocol implementations were going to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;stay in Twisted (or perhaps a twisted.protocols project, if that gets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;split off), and just the apps (i.e. direct subpackages of twisted, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;news, mail, web, names, conch, ...) would be seperated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nah. These split-offs are going to contain protocols and minimal 
</I>&gt;<i> framework for implementing apps, along with maybe a very simple 
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of an actual app.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;So, I assume that this is the policy that other splits should follow?  If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;so, this needs to be documented.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let it be known that the split-offs will contain relevant protocols.
</I>
Ok :)

&gt;<i> &gt;I'd like to see the reasons for these decisions summarised in that document
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;too -- I can guess at them, but it would be nice to know, and will help
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;future splits of subprojects go smoothly and consistently.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not interested in creating a &quot;Split Document&quot;, because that's an 
</I>&gt;<i> inherently temporal thing. With the help of exarkun, there does exist a 
</I>&gt;<i> small file documenting the process that I must go through to do a split 
</I>&gt;<i> for a particular project, but it is not of general interest (no 
</I>&gt;<i> rationale, etc).
</I>
Well, when I say &quot;document&quot;, a post to the mailing list would do just fine.
Just somewhere public that can be referred to later, if necessary.
