I had a thought briefly yesterday that got lost in my helpful (off-list)
exchange with radix about whether policy could keep cross-projects tasks
like docs (and testing I suppose) sane: a policy doc would be most
helpful for newcomers to the Twisted community who've decided their itch
is a new subproject, because they want to add support for a blah
protocol. Reading a policy doc would be a lot faster than absorbing
policy on IRC for an outsider. Or at least so it appears to me.

&gt;<i> Twisted, to many developers, is the extremely consistent coding style,
</I>&gt;<i> packaging style, and central point of distribution.  A project
</I>&gt;<i> developed by 'the labs' also implicitly depends on some other core
</I>&gt;<i> packages, and we need policy about things like running regression
</I>&gt;<i> tests with multiple versions of dependencies in order that those core
</I>&gt;<i> packages continue to support their clients correctly to even maintain
</I>&gt;<i> parity with our current development process's quality level.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the policy will seem obvious, but other packages don't follow
</I>&gt;<i> it.  For example, we should make sure that everything uses distutils
</I>&gt;<i> as its build process.
</I>
If people want a policy doc, send me notes towards it and I'll happily
turn it into something doc-like or a series thereof. I know there's
coding standards already.
