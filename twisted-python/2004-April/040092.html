<PRE>Radix/Itamar,

It's clear that y'all have put a good deal of thought into this,
so please take my feedback as just meandering thoughts.

I suppose that lockstep has caused release management problems?  How
is this going to solve the problem?  (ie, are you sure it is a
problem, and that the solution fixes it?)

</I>
This seems primarly a documentation problem, that is, 
it is solved with a README document in the package.  Personally,
I've never had issues with modules being stable or not.  Perhaps
a package manager could use a list of packages that are stable?
ie, &quot;python setup.py --with-experimental install&quot;

In any case, I think this package management issue needs to be
addressed no matter what your naming convention is.

|<i> &gt; twisted.xish -&gt; No idea.
</I>|<i> &gt;    No idea. I imagine this will just be made a part of the Jabber
</I>|<i> &gt;    package, whatever that is.
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> Yeah. Jabber will probably be in the Words pacakge, so xish will end up
</I>|<i> there (unless people tell us it is generally applicable).
</I>
So, it will be in jabber (which I don't need?) till at some
time it turns out that someone needs it, and then it will
move somewhere else.

Bings,

Clark
