Luckily for you, I've already changed my mind on this, in favour of building
timeouts on top of some sort of cancellation support (see my reply to Bob).

Well, that's one way to look at it, I suppose.  Certainly, deferreds that
can support cancellation should be declared that way when they are created,
whether by a flag to the constructor or by using a subclass.  DeferredList
changes its behaviour pretty significantly based on constructor flags, and I
think we made the right decision there.  Cancellations aren't all that
similar to &quot;fireOnOneErrback&quot;, though.  I don't have a strong preference on
flags vs.  subclasses here, except that I would tend to lean towards
whichever one has the simpler implementation.

&gt;<i> Perhaps we're putting the responsibility in the wrong place entirely.  
</I>&gt;<i> Deferreds which can be timed out are often tracked with some kind of ID

</I>&gt;<i> DeferredOperationManager is used, would remove the Deferred from the 
</I>&gt;<i> mapping.  Regular Deferreds would then have no setTimeout, and Bob 
</I>&gt;<i> could use them without importing all of Twisted.
</I>
This idea sounds equally applicable to cancellable deferreds as to just
timeoutable deferreds.  I'd be happy to see any that eases the
implementation of creating Deferreds that can be cancelled -- I think that
that is really the hardest part of the whole problem (aside from desigining
an API everyone likes ;)
