Ahem, I've been working on release-twisted full-time for the past 2 or 3 
days :-)

Anyway, I see no point in making it bootstrapped. The only 
&quot;bootstrapping&quot; that would theoretically be necessary is for releasing 
Twisted itself, where r-t is contained, and that's been possible since 
its conception. All of the other projects can just rely on the presence 
of twisted during their release.
