afraid you haven't picked a very easy task for which to start using =

</I>  More likely you'll want either a RawUDPProtocol subclass, or something =

very much like one.  You'll also need to create a new transport class =

which works on raw sockets.  There isn't really any documentation for =

this, as it is something that needs to be done very infrequently.  There =

is one example of creating a new transport type in my sandbox:

  =

<A HREF="http://svn.twistedmatrix.com/cvs/trunk/sandbox/exarkun/ipv6.py?root=3DTwist=">http://svn.twistedmatrix.com/cvs/trunk/sandbox/exarkun/ipv6.py?root=3DTwist=</A>
ed

It is for TCP/IPv6 only, but should mostly be applicable to your case.

&gt;<i>How can I get at the 'raw' udp packets for receiving and sending?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Sorry if this is obvious.
</I>&gt;<i>  =
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>  Certainly not.  :)  If you get it working (documented, tested,etc ;), =

it might be nice if you could contribute it back, since raw socket =

support is something that does get asked for every once in a while.  =

It'd be nice to be able to tell someone how to use existing support, =

instead of telling them they have to implement it.
