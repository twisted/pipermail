I think that we are going to need some of #2 as well.  Without the 
Imposition From Above, the subprojects are likely to start in a similar 
place (modeled after Twisted.Web, as you suggest) and gradually diverge 
based on evolutionary needs, leaving them all completely different and 
weird in a year's time.

Your focus on docs is correct, though, because what we really need is a 
shared policy document :).

What we ALSO need, Christopher Armstrong, if you are reading this, is a 
release-twisted script which is its own, bootstrap-released project 
that can be run on ANY of the twisted subprojects to generate an 
instant release.
