I'd be happy for a compromise of installing the new twisted.web (which I
like calling Unwound) as tmlabs.web.

But frankly, I find it a pain in the butt to have to refer to things by
python module name when discussing them.  In the past I've had to get
sidetracked by explaining twisted to people when trying to talk about
twisted.web.  If I had to explain tmlabs.web I'd have to explain that
tmlabs is a seperate name space for non twisted core subprojects THEN
explain what the heck twisted is.  

I think having a short simple, and indeed clever or catchy product name
is much easier.  I like the sound of jelly,banana,pb,lowdown,unwound
because if I have to explain what they are, they're atleast something
that people will remember, and indeed are google friendly.

Not to mention the fact that Open Source (not just Twisted) has a great
history of clever names, Apache is a-patchy webserver because it started
out as a bunch of patches, Linux was originally going to be called
Freenix by Linus, which might be descriptive as it is a Free Unix, but
not nearly as interesting.  I think the only real concern with choosing
names for twisted subprojects is not picking something that we'll be
forced to change every couple of months.

On another note Unwound seems to be free from any software product
naming conflicts, and I think it is very descriptive as a &quot;rewrite of
twisted.web&quot;
