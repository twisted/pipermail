&gt;<i> &quot;Always, always, always use good, unabbreviated, correctly-spelled
</I>&gt;<i> meaningful names.&quot; - <A HREF="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MeaningfulNames">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MeaningfulNames</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I've posted on the twisted.web list and ranted on #twisted,  I feel very
</I>&gt;<i> strongly that the proposed subprojects for twisted should  have meaningful
</I>&gt;<i> names that convey their function and relationship with each other. On the
</I>&gt;<i> #twisted IRC channel, Itamar talked about the use of tmlabs as a prefix for
</I>&gt;<i> the subproject names. This makes perfect sense to me. What would you rather
</I>&gt;<i> see in a list of packages, this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> TimmysToy
</I>&gt;<i> Lowdown
</I>&gt;<i> Dot
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> or this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> tmlabs.web
</I>&gt;<i> tmlabs.news
</I>&gt;<i> tmlabs.dns
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which is easier for the uninitiated user or potential user of twisted to
</I>&gt;<i> comprehend? Do you want to convey information in a name or hide it?
</I>
Well, I am pretty uninitiated, so I'll describe how the things are from my
perspective. The answer is:

That depends.

I know, what does serializer do. I hardly had any idea what does &quot;Jelly&quot; do,
when I've seen that name for the first time. On the other hand, when I've
learned it, I prefer the name &quot;Jelly&quot;, it is easier to use, than
&quot;TwistedPickle&quot;, &quot;TwistedSerializer&quot;, &quot;SamePickleOnlyPortable&quot;. Is &quot;Jelly&quot; a
meaningful name for a serializer? I really doubt that, perhaps that's
obvious for native American/English people, not for me. Anyway, since I
understood it, I like it. That's one thing.

Here goes another: I know, what DNS mean and what does it stand for; I have
no idea what &quot;Twisted Dot&quot; is. Of course, I could learn it (&quot;dot&quot; is more
meaningful name for a dns, than &quot;oak&quot;, for example - there's already such
product, and it does dns in python, btw). Also it is easier to create a cool
webpage graphics logo for &quot;Twisted Dot - the DNS server&quot; (you could just use
dot.kde.org slogan ;), than just for &quot;Twisted DNS server&quot;. Perhaps it could
be called &quot;tmlabs.dns&quot;, but then question arises:

	What is tmlabs.dns?
	
	[ ] DNS client
	[ ] DNS server
        [ ] DNS client library
	[ ] DNS server library
	[ ] All of the above
	[ ] None of the above
	
For example, currently phrase &quot;use conch&quot; is meaningless without the
context; it should be either &quot;use conch server&quot; or &quot;use conch client&quot;. And I
really, really, really have no idea if naming server/client in a different
way would be a good thing.

Another thing... I don't really known if vendor-name-as-prefix is a good
idea. I like &quot;twisted.*&quot; more, than &quot;tmlabs.*&quot; ;)
