Does XPath actually specify transformation operations? I thought that 
was up to something like XSLT. I agree that XPath should only be used 
for node matching, and that transformation should be done in other 
ways.

</I>&gt;<i> I'll be glad to add additional logic as necessary to enhance the

</I>
This is not related to the current discussion, but I have been 
contemplating replacing nevow's fixed scheme which only looks for nodes 
with nevow 'specials' on them (such as render and data) with a 
dictionary of {xpath expression object: transformation function}. It is 
not something I am planning on doing right away, but eventually, and it 
would be nice to use some existing code for this.

&gt;<i> FWIW, xish.xpath is &quot;actively developed&quot;, there just haven't been any
</I>&gt;<i> feature or bug requests against it for a while. :)
</I>
I wish more software were in this mode. &quot;It's flexible enough to use 
without having to change the internals&quot; is the holy grail of software 
engineering.
