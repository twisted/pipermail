  Just to be sure I'm reading this correctly, you have something like...

    class Foo:
        bar = []

    Foo.bar.append(baz)
    someRemoteRef.callRemote('doStuff', Foo)

  where you want 'remote_doStuff' to receive a class object whose &quot;bar&quot; attribute is [baz] (or possibly [RemoteReference(baz)], or *something* containing baz)?  If not, disregard the rest of my post :)  Otherwise ...

  You're going to have difficulty using PB with this approach.  PB can serialize classes, but it does so in exactly the way Andrew described: it looks up their name and sends it, and the other side turns the name back into an object.  Any mutable class state you change on one side will *not* be reflected on the other side.

  I'd recommend moving your mutable state off these class objects and onto instances of some sort.  Otherwise, you will have to implement special jelliers/unjelliers for the class objects you want treated specially.
