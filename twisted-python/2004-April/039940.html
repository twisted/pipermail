  Twisted doesn't enforce any design strategies with respect to any GUI
code you use it with.  If you simply require that your ServerFactory
or ClientFactory be able to reference multiple GUI objects, this seems as
simple as:

    f = YourFactory(chatRoomGUIObject, privateRoomGUIObject,
                    gameGUIObject, ...)

  Not that I would go down that particular road myself.

</I>
  Think about what information needs to move between the network layer
(where information is received from sockets), the application layer (where
messages from a particular user are differentiated from messages from 
another particular user), and the UI layer (where messages are rendered
in some fashion so as to be visible to the end user).

  Try and come up with the narrowest interface possible that lets that
information move between those layers.  In this instance, &quot;narrow&quot; would
mean not passing every GUI class you have to your factory.  Perhaps an
event broadcasting system would be useful, or maybe a single &quot;GUI&quot; class
that knows how to delegate messages down to the various other GUI classes
you have defined.
