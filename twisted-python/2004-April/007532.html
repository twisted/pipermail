+10, setTimeout as-is is just about the absolute worst way it could 
possibly be implemented, and this version makes sense.  The only 
&quot;problem&quot; is that existing APIs will have to be refactored such that 
there is something useful and public you can use for 
&quot;handleTimeoutCondition&quot;, because IIRC most of them don't have a 
cancellation feature at all -- let alone one that's public and usable.
