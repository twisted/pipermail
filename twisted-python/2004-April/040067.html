Gross.

This is really my problem with setTimeout, really.  Right now it 
changes the semantics of .callback() and .errback() subtly - adding an 
'allowTimeouts' flag effectively changes the object's contract at 
run-time.  I know that callback and errback do this already, but it's 
implied that there is a single source of responsibility for calling 
those methods.

What we've really got here is two separate interfaces: IDeferred and 
ITimeoutableDeferred.  I think that it might be appropriate to 
implement one as a subclass, which does the twisted.internet-related 
stuff.

Perhaps we're putting the responsibility in the wrong place entirely.  
Deferreds which can be timed out are often tracked with some kind of ID 
in a map of Deferreds.  Maybe we should have a DeferredOperationManager 
class which abstracts that functionality, removing the deferred from 
the map when its callback/errback is called whether it's called by a 
timeout or not...?  Constructing a TimeoutableDeferred would then 
*require* a callback that, in the common case where a 
DeferredOperationManager is used, would remove the Deferred from the 
mapping.  Regular Deferreds would then have no setTimeout, and Bob 
could use them without importing all of Twisted.
