<PRE>I had been trying to straighten out the model for the split since my
first post to twisted-web regarding it.  Now that radix, and exarkun
have split twisted.news out of the core codebase as &quot;lowdown&quot;. Since
then I have begun work on my own source tree of twisted.web, the module
has been split as &quot;unwound&quot; which is my proposed name as mentioned in
the numerous naming threads (to be installed as tmlabs.unwound if
desired.)  

So far I've done the following:

 * duplicate the source tree renaming the toplevel module and changing
the imports accordingly.

 * run the tests (everything passes just as it does in twisted.web)

 * removed modules that were deprecated BY woven, and added a
Deprecation Warning message to unwound.woven.__init__

If there are no complaints about this I'm asking someone (like radix) to
help me complete the rest of the steps necessary to make this the
official split so i can start working on changes and enhancements.  The
things I can't do on my own, atleast not as part of twistedmatrix.com is
setup the SVN repo and the project page.  

Also it appears if radix and exarkun did not solve (or atleast did not
implmenet a solution for) the tap naming conflicts.  I.E. if lowdown or
tmlabs.lowdown is going to use mktap news or mktap lowdown instead.

Other than that, Unwound is currently a useable tree of twisted.web At
revision 10601.

(I'm open to changing the name to either tmlabs.web or some cute/catchy
name other than 'unwound', but ultimately I think that is a policy
decision that falls on the core twisted devs.)
