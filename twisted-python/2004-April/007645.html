I don't think the distinction between code and data is necesarrily so
clear...  Basically my point was that I wasn't interested in something like
XML RPC, and would rather treat remotely passed objects as if they were
local to the extent possible.

Using `Terrain.moveCost` instead of `unserialize(&quot;Terrain&quot;).moveCost` seems
good to me.

Ok.  I'm perfectly happy to get a critique of my design out of this if I
can! ;-)  I'll try to keep it concise.

I have a dictionary of hexes keyed by their grid location.

map.cells = {(1,1):hexCellInstance, ...}

Each of these cells has a .terrain, which is a reference to a Terrain
subclass.  These have static data and methods, for use by various game
algorithms, e.g. how far can unit Foo move through Mountains.

On each turn a (filtered) version of this state is passed to game clients,
so that they can view it, validate their orders against it, etc.

PS I'm off to watch a movie, so won't be able to respond further until
later tonight.
