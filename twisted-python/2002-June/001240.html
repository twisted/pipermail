<PRE>Hello,

After some speculation I stumbled across a little nut, what happens if I use LGPLed examples. Are these a part of the library and thus define the code itself as a library, or will they give Glyph a pica-percentage copyright on huge works based on the code?

So, there's this file LICENSE that everyone must read through for fun. There's also an EULA coming up each time I install something on windows that I've never read through, except for fun. However, there are people believing in such inane matters, so I found this portion:

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

That states: The examples are not a part of the library, thus they are just copyrighted by glyph. So, everyone who used the pb-echo-examples, Glyph owns that code (partly). I don't know what rights he inherently has, but he has the copyright.

What kind of licence should the example have? I would like to place it in Public Domain, because if stuff can be taken from there, then we should be able to place stuff there as well.
