The error may be fine as a string instead of a status code - depends on 
the requirements.

You still need to deal with connectionLost, which is in the Protocol 
still. But, if all Protocols have a factory, we could have them report 
to their factory that they are closed as part of their interface 
definition. But note that currently we do *not* require that protocols 
refer to a factory - it's merely a common implementation. Some protocols 
only refer to their service (e.g. in words, IIRC).

</I>
Well, for servers, just logging errors when attempting to listen on a 
port it, as we do now is acceptable - most servers work this way, where 
errors are logged. It's connections that really need error reporting, 
for clients. Of course, some client applications (p2p, FTP) listen on 
ports as well...
