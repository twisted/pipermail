<PRE>First off, thanks for the reply!  My responses/questions are inline below.

Sure, not per se.  However, you can essentially send copies of objects 
through PB, provided both sides of the wire have the same class definition.


&gt;<i> Are you talking about a particular protocol in Twisted?  Serializing 
</I>&gt;<i> large objects through PB might take a long time.  In that case, it's 
</I>&gt;<i> not &quot;Twisted&quot; that is busy, but your program which is busy serializing 
</I>&gt;<i> that object.
</I>
It comes in the twisted installation package, in the module 
&quot;twisted.spread.pb&quot; ;-)

Anyway, the delay comes in a call to (a) perspective.callRemote().  I 
understand that this isn't a reactor scheduled action, but nonetheless I 
don't have any direct control over how things are jellied without 
hacking Twisted.


&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure of a good/nice way to deal with this.  Slicing 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transmissions into a sequence of smaller chunks seems like a fair 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pain in the ass, but then again the alternatives are punting to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another thread/process. :-/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, punting to another thread or process is still going to slow 
</I>&gt;<i> down your rendering, but in a much less deterministic way.  The OS 
</I>&gt;<i> scheduler is going to be interrupting the rendering rather than the 
</I>&gt;<i> long-running serialization function.  Breaking down the serialization 
</I>&gt;<i> work into smaller chunks will allow you to better control what's going 
</I>&gt;<i> on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sending the work of serializing a large object to another process 
</I>&gt;<i> won't work anyway: how are you going to get that large object to the 
</I>&gt;<i> other process to serialize in the first place, without serializing it? 
</I>&gt;<i> Sending it to another thread probably won't work either, since if the 
</I>&gt;<i> object is large it is likely shared (and therefore will involve 
</I>&gt;<i> locking large portions of the data structure for long periods of time) 
</I>&gt;<i> and Python's GIL will introduce deleterious effects for your framerate 
</I>&gt;<i> anyway.
</I>
In hindsight I see a separate process won't work (duh!)  However, I was 
thinking a thread might work, since the data I'm sending (players get a 
filtered view of the game's true state) isn't used by anything else, and 
the data isn't /that/ large. ;-)  Am I missing something low level 
here?  Would this end up locking bits other than those being serialized?

I suppose it's a bit moot, as I'm reluctant to fiddle with threading.


&gt;<i> Fundamentally what you are doing here is optimizing your program.  
</I>&gt;<i> Your serialization is slow and it needs to be faster so that it does 
</I>&gt;<i> not impact your framerate.  This is a difficult problem, one which is 
</I>&gt;<i> made worse by the fact that Python does not have a particularly fast 
</I>&gt;<i> runtime. There's no quick answer: you don't need to restructure your 
</I>&gt;<i> main loop, you need to think about what your program is spending its 
</I>&gt;<i> time doing.
</I> 
Optimizing my program (e.g. by sending a bunch of smaller data chunks) 
feels like the wrong way to go...  Wouldn't it make more sense to hack 
PB's callRemote() to do this in a more general manner?  I'm thinking 
somewhere around jelly._Jellier.jelly()'s recursive calls to itself;  
perhaps using generators, although I'm fuzzy on the implications of 
recursion + generators...

Either way it's definitely optimization, so not exactly a pressing issue 
for me to resolve until the end.
