Nice to hear that we're helping to increase the transistor density of 
the universe.

I've seen Twisted Wars.  It's flattering, but I hope it's going to 
evolve from beyond its, ahem, &quot;humble&quot; beginnings into something more 
interesting :).  Nice to unveil the mystery of its author, though ...
&gt;<i>To my surprise, after changing the core runtime to a cooiterator, my 
</I>&gt;<i>frame
</I>&gt;<i>rate improved (albeit only about +5 - but this might be more noticeable 
</I>&gt;<i>if I
</I>&gt;<i>had a decent frame rate to start with).  I explained to a friend who's 
</I>&gt;<i>also
</I>&gt;<i>working on the game and they refused to believe me! Ha!
</I>
Although I'm glad you've gained some insight into the exciting world of 
improving performance (or not) with parallelism, I wouldn't read too 
much into this.  threadedselectreactor is a particularly poorly-tested 
piece of code and it might have performance bugaboos of its own that 
have nothing to do with concurrency.  Also, as I said, I've tried 
Twisted Wars; one of the things I noticed about it is that the framerate 
seems to degrade slowly over time until the game becomes sluggish and 
unplayable.  It seems like you're leaking computation somewhere.  So 
you've got a lot of factors to consider when measuring your overall 
framerate.
