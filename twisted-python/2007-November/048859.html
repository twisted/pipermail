<PRE>
We are looking for a friendly and talented Twisted programmer to work 
part-time on an interactive museum exhibit.

Some background.  &quot;On April 29, 1903, at 4:10 a.m., 82 million tonnes of 
limestone crashed from the summit of Turtle Mountain and buried a 
portion of the sleeping town of Frank [Alberta] ... The primary cause of 
the Frank Slide was the mountain's unstable structure.&quot;  Here's a good 
aerial photo of the mountain and slide debris:
    <A HREF="http://ess.nrcan.gc.ca/rrnh-rran/images/proj1_fig2.jpg">http://ess.nrcan.gc.ca/rrnh-rran/images/proj1_fig2.jpg</A>

Our exhibit, due to be deployed in January at the Frank Slide 
Interpretive Centre (white building adjacent to debris in above image), 
is tasked with the reason for the collapse.  To do this, we have opted 
to use a virtual time-line with a 65&quot; screen moving electronically along 
a 14ft (4m) industrial slide track.  The visitor, kept back from the 
screen mechanism by a parallel guard rail, controls the screen position 
via a slideable block.  The content, synced with the screen position, 
shows the 150 million-year formation of the mountain and its eventual 
collapse in 1903.

The Twisted work involves ethernet interfacing with a Gemini GV6K 
hardware controller and PB communication with the pyObjC-based Quicktime 
display code.  (An aside, we are also interested in logging visitor 
usage to a local or remote database.)  As my Twisted experience is 
limited, I can only guess that we are looking at 40-80 hours of work in 
total.  While the schedule is flexible, we do need to start coding ASAP 
to meet our first prototype deadline.  Work is remote, connecting by VPN 
to the hardware in question.  As the deployment platform is OS X, 
ideally the programmer would be using a Mac ... this isn't critical.

If you're interested, please contact me directly (<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">darran at edmstudio.com</A>) 
with your resume/experience, hourly rate, and availability.

Cheers,
Darran.
