</I>&gt;<i> If you've got a large object, let's say the state of the game world, 
</I>&gt;<i> and you need to lock it for use within a thread, it is likely that 
</I>&gt;<i> other things in your program will want to access it before long.  You 
</I>&gt;<i> can only have so many &quot;large&quot; objects in a program, after all, and 
</I>&gt;<i> they tend to be shared.  The one you referred to, &quot;the game's true 
</I>&gt;<i> state&quot;, is obviously going to be accessed by a lot of code unless you 
</I>&gt;<i> have a very strange game indeed.
</I>I don't send the players the &quot;True State&quot;, I first calculate a trimmed 
and altered copy of it, according to what they can perceive.  I then 
send this, which in practice isn't used by anything else on the server.


&gt;&gt;<i> Optimizing my program (e.g. by sending a bunch of smaller data 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chunks) feels like the wrong way to go...  Wouldn't it make more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sense to hack PB's callRemote() to do this in a more general manner?  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm thinking somewhere around jelly._Jellier.jelly()'s recursive 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> calls to itself; perhaps using generators, although I'm fuzzy on the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implications of recursion + generators...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> callRemote *can't* do this in a general manner and remain compatible 
</I>&gt;<i> with PB's existing semantics.  It would be extraordinarily difficult 
</I>&gt;<i> to come up with semantics that would make sense for this.  Consider:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  bob = Mob(hitPoints=3)
</I>&gt;<i>  jethro = Player()
</I>&gt;<i>  jethro.callRemote(&quot;enterSensoryRange&quot;, bob)
</I>&gt;<i>  bob.hitPoints += 1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How many hit points does Jethro think Bob has?  Probably 3, but if PB 
</I>&gt;<i> might be breaking up serialization work into separate reactor turns 
</I>&gt;<i> for you behind your back, then maybe 4.  Given that there's no way to 
</I>&gt;<i> know, you don't know whether you have to send Jethro an update to 
</I>&gt;<i> bob's hit points or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can figure out how to answer this question in a way that makes 
</I>&gt;<i> sense (i.e. never uses the word &quot;maybe&quot;) then you might be able to 
</I>&gt;<i> implement something very cool and useful.  I certainly can't think of 
</I>&gt;<i> a way to do it, though.  Good luck!
</I>
For my game, that's actually pretty straight forward, as I don't allow 
such complex situations.  I allow 3 things though PB:
1) Ask for status
2) Request current state
3) send actions for the current turn

Clients never actually /do/ anything (eg &quot;enterSensoryRange), but 
instead schedule actions for the game server to carry out on their 
behalf at a later time (simultaneously with other players' actions).

The only time a client get a large chunk of data is when it's asked for 
it, and clients know enough to wait for a response.  It's possible for 
the client to send actions based on an old turn right before a new turn 
is processed, but these are simply tossed out with a warning that 
they're out of date, and the client should update it's state.

Reworking the above example, Jethro would always see that Bob has 3 
hitpoints on turn X, and 4 hitpoints on turn X+1.  Jethro's 
&quot;enterSensoryRange&quot; attempt would be made for a specific turn, say X.  
If it arrives before turn X+1 is calculated, he gets his result on turn 
X+1.  If it arrives late, well then Jethro was too slow.

For a more general case perhaps it's more complicated...
