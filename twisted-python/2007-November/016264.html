Thanks for the information. I would love to say that I would look at 
this, but I really don't have the knowledge of Twisted, or the time to 
do a decent job. I'll certainly add it to my to do list, but although I 
love twisted in theory, in practice, I don't write enough of the type of 
software it's good at, for me to more than dabble. My main use, as I 
hinted at in my original mail, is to just use the prepackaged 
functionality - for which you have my eternal gratitude. (As it happens, 
the need I originally had for a DNS server has passed - I found an 
easier workaround for the specific case I was interested in).

If anyone does want to work on this, I'd certainly be happy to help 
where I can - I have a reasonable amount of Windows coding experience, 
both in Python and otherwise.

Thanks once again for the detailed reply.
Paul.
