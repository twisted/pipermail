Super well!

Super DUPER well!!!
&gt;<i>In particular,  how easy is it to write applications using Twisted,

2 EASY !!!!!! [1]
&gt;<i>and how maintainable and reliable those applications will be?

A billion kajillion megamaintainotrons and a quintillion reliabinos.
&gt;<i>what might be the pros n cons of using twisted.

Pro: Twisted is great!!!!

Con: Twisted is so great, everything else will seem pretty bad after you 
have used it.
&gt;<i>any comments?

In all seriousness, it sounds like your application is pretty well- 
suited to Twisted's problem domain.  I suspect that you could use it and 
be very successful - probably more successful than if you used something 
else.

However, your applications' success, maintainability, ease of 
implementation and time to market depend on thousands of factors, and 
choice of infrastructure can influence some of them but it hardly 
dominates.  Depending on other issues, you could possibly succeed wildly 
while using a terrible environment, writing everything from your own TCP 
stack on up entirely in assembler, or fail horribly while using Twisted 
and doing everything right.

That's compounded by the fact that your questions are both highly 
subjective and only have meaning in relation to other, similar tools - 
and there are a lot of other tools like Twisted, depending on what you 
think Twisted is like.  Is Twisted good?  Yes.  How good?  More good 
than bad.  You're unlikely to get other answers on this list, after all, 
everyone listening here has most likely decided to use Twisted for one 
reason or another.

Do you have specific aspects of Twisted you intend to use, or 
maintenance tasks that you expect to perform?  What would you like us to 
compare it to?  What other technologies are you considering?  Have you 
implemented anything like this before?  Using what infrastructure?  What 
problems did you have?  How did you solve them?  Are you used to working 
with the open source community?

Sorry I couldn't provide a more useful answer, but I hope I've at least 
explained why I couldn't :).
