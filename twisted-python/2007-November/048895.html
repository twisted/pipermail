<PRE>Hello all,

As you may know, radix and others are working on automating the
Twisted release process so that we can move to a more frequent,
predictable release cycle.

The tickets to do so are here:
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;component=release+management&amp;milestone=twisted-7.0&amp;order=priority">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;component=release+management&amp;milestone=twisted-7.0&amp;order=priority</A>

Our goal is to do a release using the automated tools before the end
of this year.

If you want to help out, there are three things you can do:

1. Help implement one of the release tickets.
The release tickets need coding. Some of the tickets have fairly poor
descriptions -- but that's ok. All that means is that your first step
is hassling radix to clarify what he means.

If you are going to hack on these, it's very important that you do
test-driven development. We want this code to be first-class.

2. Fix tickets more generally.
I *was* going to recommend that you work on some of our tickets with
'high' and 'highest' priority, but it turns out that they represent
one quarter of all open tickets. Still, if that doesn't daunt you then
please start hacking. I promise that the regular developers will be
extra nice and friendly in helping get started with the Twisted code
base.

3. Review branches
All code that goes into Twisted must be reviewed before it lands. It
doesn't really take much arcane knowledge to do a code review. All you
have to do is make sure the code conforms to our conventions, check
the test coverage and then ask questions about any bit you don't
understand. The idea is that if you don't understand it, the code
should be clearer.

Branches up for review are listed here: <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/report/15">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/report/15</A>

There's general information about Twisted development here:

Happy hacking,
jml
