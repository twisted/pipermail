As you've explained it here, that should be impossible under any 
circumstances.

Can you provide a minimal, runnable example that demonstrates what you 
mean by &quot;losing messages&quot;?

Given Twisted's pretty awesome track record in this regard, I'd say that 
it's most likely that your networking code is not dealing with different 
levels of latency very well - a common error is treating a chunk sent to 
dataReceived as a single message (it isn't, it's a randomly-sized chunk 
of data received from the network).
&gt;<i>The second is that my application hangs randomly.  When I call 
</I>&gt;<i>renderFrame()
</I>&gt;<i>in a simple loop (no Twisted), everything is rock-solid.
</I>
Most likely an event handler registered on a network socket is doing 
something that blocks or takes a long time to complete.  That isn't 
Twisted, that's your application.  Tools like 'strace' can help you 
figure out what's going on.
&gt;<i>Has anyone done anything like this before (realitime 3D application 
</I>&gt;<i>with
</I>&gt;<i>Twisted), or am I breaking new ground here?
</I>
Twisted was originally designed for MMORPGs; its very first commercial 
applications were integrated with a real-time 3D engine (a very distant 
cousin of which, I believe, now powers the game Tabula Rasa).  I had no 
issues with it then, and I don't believe anyone who has used it more 
recently has had problems like the ones you're describing.
