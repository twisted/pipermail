</I>&gt;<i>thread so I can manage other server tasks distinctly.
</I>
&quot;so I can manage other server tasks distinctly&quot; doesn't make a lot of
sense as a motivation here.  Maybe that's because you don't have the
right idea about how to write servers with Twisted yet, or maybe it's
just because you haven't explained your requirements sufficiently.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I realise this is probably a critical misunderstanding on my part of

</I>&gt;<i>on this point that I wasn't able to find in the documentation.  Which,
</I>&gt;<i>again, is probably just a critical failure of mine to find.
</I>
It's possible to run the reactor in a different thread, but the reason
to do so is usually that you already have a second mainloop which you
can't easily integrate with the reactor's mainloop.  In other cases, you
can typically accomplish whatever you need without starting any threads.
