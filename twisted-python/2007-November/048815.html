__call__ doesn't have much benefit over a method which a useful name,
for what it's worth.  This isn't really related to your question or
problem, though.

&gt;<i>

</I>
Inheritance makes sense for sharing code.  It doesn't make sense for
the case you're describing.  You could just as easily have your class
create a LoopingCall in its __init__ and start it, rather than making
your class _be_ a LoopingCall.

More generally, some classes in Twisted are classic because they predate
Python's new-style classes.  We can't simply change them all to be new-
style now since there are various incompatibilities between classic and
new-style classes.

Speaking of super() specifically, it isn't even correct to use super()
even if you have new-style classes.  super() is for cooperative multiple
inheritance: all of the classes in the inheritance hierarchy have to agree
to use it.  Even if LoopingCall were new-style, it would also have to
claim that using super() with its __init__ method was supported (actually,
required).  And even then there would be no benefit until you also had
multiple inheritance.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Is there any practicular reason for that? Am I wrong to try inherit
</I>&gt;<i>the Looping Call ? Basically my code looks like :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>class SillyPinger(object):
</I>&gt;<i>        def __init__(self, factory):
</I>&gt;<i>            self.factory = factory
</I>&gt;<i>            self.pingTargets = {}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>            pingTask = task.LoopingCall(self)
</I>&gt;<i>            pingTask.start(5.0)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        def __call__(self):
</I>&gt;<i>            # do stuff
</I>&gt;<i>            pass
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The above is good.  Do that.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>while I'd like to be doing:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>class SillyPinger(task.LoopingCall):
</I>&gt;<i>        def __init__(self, factory):
</I>&gt;<i>            super(SillyPinger, self).__init__(self)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>            self.factory = factory
</I>&gt;<i>            self.pingTargets = {}
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>            self.start(5.0) # get value from .ini here
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This will always be more fragile, even if you ignore the fact
that super() doesn't work here.
