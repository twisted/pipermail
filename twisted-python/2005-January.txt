Subject: [Twisted-Python] Problem with Echoserver (TCP), Help!
Message-ID: <41D8CD3A.6030802@263.net>

Hi, I am new to Twisted. I use a Twisted 1.3.0 on MS Windows XP Home 
Edition, my python version is 2.3

I try the TCP echoserv.py and echoclient.py example. But the client 
always fail with following message:

Unhandled error in Deferred:

What is the matter? Thanks.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Interactive Twisted client (newbie question?)
Message-ID: <1104793201.41d9ce715e8e8@www.nerc-essc.ac.uk>

Hi all,

I'm new to Twisted, and I'm trying to create an implementation of a client
program that communicates over a network with a server using a protocol called
Styx.  (In case you're interested, Styx is a protocol for distributed systems,
as used by the Inferno operating system:
http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/styx.html.)  In short, Styx is a pretty
simple call-response type of protocol, in which the client sends a T-message
and waits for the corresponding R-message from the server.  There is a
one-to-one correspondence between T- and R-messages.

I understand that Twisted is an event-driven framework and I have written a
basic client program.  My initial attempt has involved creating a StyxProtocol
class that inherits from protocol.Protocol, in which I override key methods
such as dataReceived() and connectionMade().  Having created this protocol and
told it how to respond to messages that arrive, I created a simple Factory
class, then set the whole thing running with reactor.run().  It works fine, but
it's not quite in the form I'd like.  In my current attempt, what I've done is
essentially to create a load of callbacks and "press GO".  Once I've set the
program running I can't interact with it until one of the methods calls
reactor.stop().

What I'd like to be able to do is illustrated by the following pseudo-Python. 
This could be a script or could be typed into an interactive Python shell:

conn = StyxConnection("myserver.remotehost.com", 6666)
conn.connect() # Starts the reactor going and performs handshakes
# The connection is now open and I can interact with it
myRemoteFile = conn.openFile("/path/to/myfile") # Gets handle to file on remote
server, by exchange of a few messages
data = myRemoteFile.read() # Reads data from the remote file, again by exchange
of some messages
conn.close() # Closes the connection to the remote server and stops the reactor

How can I do this with the Twisted framework?  As far as I can tell,
reactor.run() will not return until something calls reactor.stop().  I could
achieve what I want using threads (I think), but I'd like to avoid this if
possible.

I'm sure I'm not the first to ask this sort of question, but I've looked through
the docs and example code and haven't been able to track down an answer.  I'd
be very grateful for any pointers that anyone could offer.

Regards,
Jon

According to distrowatch.com, all recent releases of gobolinux have at least
Python 2.2, so any version of Twisted should work just fine.  I'd recommend
the current release, 1.3.0.

A Gobolinux mailing list sounds like a better place to ask such a question.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] nevow.compy.CannotAdapt: WovenContext...
Message-ID: <1104874643.31904.249.camel@6 webmail.nil8r.net 

I copied some code from an existing site of mine to a new machine and
boom.... does not work anymore :) the code is based on the guard
example... I actually went on to remove more and more of my code till I
realized that even with the basic example itself it fails after the user
logged in :

It seems the code that fails is:

def render_sessionId(self, context, data):
		sess = inevow.ISession(context)
		return context.tag[sess.uid]

The complete trace follows. Any ideas? I probably forget to install
something... did I?

this is gentoo standard ebuilds for python, twisted and nevow:

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Beginners confusion on components tutorial
Message-ID: <1104876260.22279.11.camel@flocke.chester.at>

Hi TwistedListUsers,

ive started to work with twisted, and learned from the howtos/docs on
the webpage.

I got a little bit confused on trying to understand how components work
in twisted as describe on
"http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/howto/components"

ive tryed the HairDryer Example and got wrong as the expected 
"AdaptToAmericanSocket" didnt work as described in the example.

as my understanding of this the example code of the HairDryer Class
is wrong, as it should call
"assert socket.voltage() == 110, 'BOOM'" 
as
"assert adapted.voltage() == 110, 'BOOM'"

which makes the example work as expected.

if im wrong please correct me and point me to my miss understanding of
the example and components.

thanks,
kind regards
Michael Lang

Known bug, fixed in SVN:

Now's probably a good time to remind people that you can see the development
version of the howtos here, updated after every commit:

This is why I often suggest the use of 'twistd' for running your Twisted
code - the reactor.run() call is confusing, because it makes it seem as
though it's your code's responsibility to start and stop the reactor,
and possibly to do things before or after that has happened.

Even if you need to start the reactor yourself - for example, if you are
writing a GUI program - it is best to abstract out the reactor
start/stop far from your application code.

If I understand the core of your question correctly, it's "How do I use
Twisted at the interactive Python interpreter?"

There is no easy answer.  Twisted is not well-suited towards use at a
normal Python prompt, because the normal Python prompt is not
event-driven.  There have been a few different forays into interactive
Python/Twisted integration.  The 1.3.0 release includes a 'manhole'
client/server pair which will allow you to log in and run python code
inside a running Twisted process.  JP Calderone has recently done quite
a bit of work on a new, better interactive interpreter (including SSH
access and command-line editing) which looks more like a regular Python
prompt.

Although there are several different avenues you can take to get there,
what you probably want to arrive at is a Twisted server that is
listening on one port for Python commands, and on another for whatever
protocol it is you are trying to implement.  For convenience, it may be
useful for the "port" that it's listening on to actually be standard
I/O.  This is possible using twisted.internet.stdio.

Hi Glyph,

Thanks very much for your reply, very useful.  I've had another think about my
problem and I guess it boils down to this question: when I'm writing a client
program, how can I simulate a synchronous function call (avoiding callbacks)
like this pseudo-Python, which sends a message then returns its reply:

def sendMessage(message):
   transport.send(message)
   # Wait for reply to arrive
   reply = getReplySomehow()
   return reply

In the protocol I am implementing, I expect most messages to be replied to
immediately by the server so this function would not block for long (I'm only
writing a simple, naive client at the moment).  The event-driven model seems to
me to be great for implementing servers, but a little more awkward for
implementing simple client programs.  Is this comment fair?

I can see how I would implement the above pseudo-function using threads (indeed
I have done so in Java) - perhaps this is my only option to avoid blocking?

Thanks,
Jon

  One way is to have getReplySomehow() context switch out of sendMessage() 
and into something capable of constructing getReplySomehow()'s return 
value, then switching back and returning it to be bound to the name reply.

  Twisted has ignore this rather successfully up until recently.  It is,
after all, a basic language feature, and should be provided by the runtime.
Nothing about it is Twisted specific, and it is perfectly possible to write
a Twisted program without this trick.

  Recently Chris Armstrong's "deferred generator" support was added to 
t.i.defer, though.  With it, you write code something like this:

    from twisted.internet import defer

    def sendMessage(message):
        transport.send(message)
        intermediate = defer.waitForDeferred(getReplySomehow())
        yield intermediate
        reply = intermediate.getResult()
        yield reply
    sendMessage = deferredGenerator(sendMessage)

  This supposes that getReplySomehow() returns a Deferred, and causes
sendMessage to also return a Deferred (one which fires with reply 
eventually).  The benefit is not immediately obvious here, since you 
are handing reply back to your caller, rather than using it.  The exact
equivalent code without this technique is:

    def sendMessage(message):
        transport.send(message)
        return getReplySomehow()

  However, there is some benefit if, instead of returning reply, sendMessage
uses it locally a bit.

  There are other solutions, of course.  You can use pre-emptive threads,
as provided by Python's threading module (or Twisted's thin layer on top
of it).  Keep in mind that there is pretty much only one threadsafe API in
Twisted (callInThread).  If you do this, you will have to be extremely 
careful not to call Twisted APIs from the wrong place.  There is an example 
of a somewhat generic implementation of this solution in my sandbox.  
It gives the appearance of working (and may even do so), but consider it 
untested and loaded with bugs (I'm certainly not using it in any of my 
software).

  Greenlets are another solution along these lines.  They simply replace
pre-emptive kernel threads with cooperative user-space threads.  As such,
you do not need to worry about calling Twisted APIs from the wrong thread,
since there is no wrong thread.  Greenlets are implemented with some tricky
voodoo, so once again, while I know of no bugs, I also wouldn't be surprised
if using them caused a rift in space/time to open up and eat your head.

  So what's a Python programmer to do?  Well, the technique I'll actually 
recommend is the simplest: callbacks.  Oh, they're a pain to write sometimes,
but they're much less magic than the other solutions described, often perform
better, and all the bugs you'll get when using them are the simple to fix kind,
rather than the my-stack-just-got-swizzled-time-to-segv or the 
oh-there's-a-race-that-only-triggers-under-load-on-someone-else's-machine kind.
They also lead to rather more modular code than the synchronous-style equivalents.
You can unit test a callback by itself.  How do you unit test lines 7 - 11 of a
single function?

  As to your wondering about Twisted's utility for clients versus servers, I 
think you are close to the truth.  The actual divide, though, is concurrency.
If your program only needs to do one thing at a time, Twisted doesn't simplify
much.  If your program needs to do two or more things at once, then it does.
Keep in mind that, even for a client, there are often at least two things that
need to be happening: talking to the network and updating the user interface.

  Hope this helps,

  Jp

Hi Jon,

Interesting that you are implementing Styx with Twisted, I used to
work with Inferno and its father 9P (plan9) back during my Lucent
days.

Are you creating just creating a twisted Styx protocol client to use
with the vitanuova styx server or are you looking to do a server in
twisted as well? Let me know if you are redoing the styx server as
well in twisted, but back to your original problem question...

Keeping thing nice an simple, the pythonic way, I did a similar thing
in Twisted, but using a different method.. From what I can tell from
your post is you *really* want is a twisted styx client that sends
T-messages to a styx server to serve its namespace with R-messages,
and *you* want to interact with the client synchronously.. You also
asked for a better way to implement the client not using callbacks,
but that was not the real issue. For _you_ the real issue is
synchronously communicating _with_the_styx_client from a command
line..

If this assumption is correct then all you have to do is make the styx
client a server as well, for let's say the telnet protocol. Then you
can use a telnet client to connect to the telnet server (which is also
the styx client) and bingo issue commands to the styx server (via the
styx client that is also the telnet server)... Of course you will have
to pass the styx server messages back to the telnet client

Let me know if that answers you problem..

There is even an example in the howto's to setup both a client and
server from one factory

Cheers,

Anthony

As JP mentioned, you can also use twisted.internet.stdio to provide a 
command line interface to your running Twisted application.  I'm 
attaching a simple app that illustrates the point.  Here's an example 
session:

$ python stdiodemo.py
Web checker console. Type 'help' for help.
help
Valid commands: check help quit
help check
check <url>: Attempt to download the given web page
check http://www.fettig.net/
Success: got 26072 bytes.
check http://www.fettig.net/nonexistant_page
Failure: 404 Not Found
check http://not.a.real.site/
Failure: DNS lookup failed: address 'not.a.real.site' not found.
quit
Goodbye.

stdiodemo.py takes commands from standard input while the reactor is 
running. When you type "check <url>", it kicks off an asyncronous task 
(downloading the web page), and prints the result when it is finished.

Anthony's suggestion of using a Telnet server could work here too - 
there are only a couple minor changes you'd need to make to run this as 
a telnet server.

Is that helpful?

Nice example of stdio, LineReceived, and using deferreds!  Abe, can we
include this example in Twisted?

It's very similar the the standard Python 'cmd' module - it might be worth
mentioning this as part of the example.

Thanks, I'm glad you like it!  You're certainly welcome to include it 
(or a modified version) in Twisted.

One potential addition would be a command line flag to have it run as a 
  server instead of using stdio.  That might be a nice way to 
demonstrate how the same protocol can be used on stdio or in a server.

Hello,

I just committed code that fixed issue827. I think I also fixed another bug in the wrapping, but I'm not certain.

Here's the story. msg() split the privmsg text into chunks the size of (max_octets_per_line - len(fmt) - 2); fmt = 'PRIVMSG username :%s'. This means that ignoring line endings, each line sent will be at least 4 characters shorter than max_octets_per_line -- 2 for '%s', 2 for the '-2'. I don't know why the '- 2' was there.

In my commit, I took the '%s' into account, and still subtract 2 from the message chunk size. This means that the (undocumented) behaviour has changed. 

I don't really know the IRC protocol, so I don't know what line endings are sent, or whether they are relevant in the protocol API. If someone will enlighten me, I will correct code, docstrings, tests and comments accordingly.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Deferred style question.
Message-ID: <200501072040.29199.anthony@interlink.com.au>

Say I have an operation that takes a certain amount of time, and so I 
return a deferred. While the operation is still in progress, another call is 
made for the same operation.

The operation is one of those only-do-once-and-cache-the-results sort of 
things. If an operation is called a second time after the first one is done, 
defer.succeed(previousResult) is returned. If it's called a second time 
while it's still in progress, it returns a deferred that's also triggered with
the result when the operation completes.

Should I just return the same deferred?

Initially I thought 'yes, return the same deferred', but that then relies on 
the user-written callback returning the result that it was passed.

Second thought was 'no, return a new deferred', and return a new deferred and 
install a callback on the original deferred that triggers a new deferred

But then if the user's callback on the original deferred raises an error, the 
second deferred will never be triggered. Or it could simply return another
deferred, and delay the triggering of the second one.

So now I'm leaning towards (on the first call) making two deferreds - one for 
the operation, and one to be returned to the user. Then the operation 
deferred gets a callback that triggers the user's deferred. Then a second 
user call can simply add a new callback to the operation deferred. Any later
calls simply add a callback to the (cached) operation deferred, they'll be 
triggered immediately.

Does this make sense? Sample code to demonstrate what I mean is attached.

After I posted the previous, two obvious points occurred to me:

  1. This is easy enough to modify to a generally useful 'DeferredCache'
      class
  2. Said class is a nice example of a decorator <wink>

So, see the attached for a DeferredCache decorator. It's not perfect,
because it currently doesn't do keyword arguments, and all arguments
to the operation must be hashable. This could be fixed, although it 
would make the code a bit nastier.

It's funny that you are using a decorator, but not the __contains__ 
operator ;)

Pah! Here's a final version for now, fixed to work for methods and 
also supporting errbacks, as well as kwargs and unhashable arguments. 
The previous version didn't work for methods, because I was trying to be 
too clever. 

This is checked into shtoom (on a branch at the moment, since that's where 
I need it). If people like, I can check it into the twisted sandbox somewhere 
as well...

If it's considered a good idea, I'm happy for this to go into twisted proper.
Now that I've got it, there's going to be a whole pile of places I can use
this.

I would change the "if not opdef" to "if opdef is None", because it's a 
little faster and more precise.

Well, I think this or something like it should go in.  I've been using 
this idiom for years, actually.

Hey All,

When reading this know that I'm not really a python
programmer (last time was too long ago)

I posted fink info file for twisted, buildbot, and a
couple others here:

http://schwehr.org/software/fink/

No one has expressed any interest and since I do not
have the time to figure out buildbot for my project
(density), I am going to drop the info files.

If you do have interest in these files, please let me
know and if they work for you, I can easily add them
to the fink cvs tree.  I don't really know if they are
ok or not.  Otherwise, I will just leave them on my
web page and not put them into fink.

Or, if someone has a simple tutorial of setting up
buildbot (for the clueless) with only one machine that
has local only cvs and does the builds too with just a
simple make command, then if I can get buildbot
working pretty quickly then I would add these fink
packages.

I'd agree - we have similar scenarios and this is the same approach
we've been taking.

Sorry on the delay - holidays and then I forgot about it :-(

I'm still on the fence with respect to having independent "jellyable"
checks.  My concern would be that having the independent checks of
what is suitable for jellying can be fragile with respect to coupling
with the actual jelly operation.  Even with the jellyable and security
checks there are some paths in the jellier code that could still fail
the operation.

I also think I liked your earlier attempts at keeping the change
within the CopyableFailure class (I may have missed why that changed),
although even there you'd have a double jelly since you'd have to
check the jelly attempt in getStateToCopy.  Although alternatively,
CopyableFailure could just implement its own jellyFor (rather than
getStateToCopy) which handled that more gracefully and with a single
jelly attempt on the value.

Once I'd written it down, I went back and found I'd done something 
similar, but not quite as general, on any number of previous occasions.

I think it really should go in - so, the obvious question is: what else 
needs to be done to put it in? The current version in shtoom svn 
supports a couple of different options - whether to allow unhashable
arguments (in which case no caching is done), whether to cache only
operations in progress, or cache all operations. It also supports a 
cache clearing method, and works nicely as either a 2.4-style 
decorator, or an older style decorator. There's unittests (although it
still needs tests for the .errback handling, will be added shortly).

Current code is at 
http://divmod.org/cvs/branches/improved-stun/shtoom/defcache.py?root=Shtoom&view=markup

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Interactive Twisted client (newbie question?)
In-Reply-To: <20050106003505.GH7521@localhost.localdomain>
Message-ID: <000e01c4f71b$65d6a540$76a6abc0@marlow>

Hi all,

Thanks for everyone who replied with help on this issue.  After much
head-scratching I decided that Twisted was not the right framework for my
particular app and I solved my problem another way.  The idea of running a
Twisted app with a Telnet or stdio interface is a great idea though; I'll
bear this in mind for the future.

In case anyone's interested, the approach I took (for implementing a client
program that speaks the Styx protocol) was to create a client class that
implements a sendMessage() method.  When the client class connects to the
remote server, it fires off a background thread that continually listens for
received messages, firing an event when a whole message arrives.  A user can
send a message, then wait for the corresponding reply, or the user can send
a message and arrange for a callback method to be called when the reply
arrives.  (in Styx, a user can send several messages without waiting for
replies)  This allows both synchronous and asynchronous approaches and means
that I can use the client classes at the Python prompt, e.g:

from styx import *
conn = StyxConnection("aserver.com", 6666) # connect to the server
f = conn.open("afile", "r") # open a file for reading
f.read() # read the contents of the file

(In Styx, all remote resources are virtualised as files, so you interact
with a remote resource by reading from and writing to file-like objects.)

Thanks again,
Jon

Nice example of stdio, LineReceived, and using deferreds!  Abe, can we
include this example in Twisted?

Can you clarify here?  What paths are you referring to?  I'd prefer to
not duplicate those checks as well, but it seemed like the simplist
way to accomplish my goal.  It does sound like your understanding of
the code is better than mine though.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] TCP test harness
Message-ID: <1105469896.1250.25.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Has anyone written a TCP test harness in Twisted/Python? 
Someone has asked me to write one, but I'm fairly new to twisted (less
new to Python) and it seems that it would be silly for me to write
something if someone else has already written and/or posted one. 

Basically, I'm looking for a TCP test harness that will support up to a
thousand concurrent TCP connections at a time sending data to a remote
device. 

Thanks,

Braun Brelin

Sounds like a loop that calls reactor.connectTCP a bunch.  Do you need 
something more specific? Some more information might help.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] ProcessProtocol randomly not returning all of
	stdout
Message-ID: <94a776e70501131147496f4e2d@mail.gmail.com>

I recently started running into a problem where my process protocol
isn't extracting stdout accurately in all cases.  I have a method on a
service that loops through a list and runs a command, passing in each
item on the list one at a time.  Out of ~50 items in the list, and
thus ~50 invocations of the command, one or two will fail to extract
all of stdout from the command.  Instead the first character of stdout
is extracted and that is it.

The process protocol I'm using is below.  Does anyone see anything
wrong with the code?  I am using the win32event reactor and Twisted
1.3.0.


from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.internet import protocol, error, defer
from twisted.python import log

from ratcontrol import errors, config

import os, sys

class BasicProcessProtocol(protocol.ProcessProtocol):
    def __init__(self):
        self.deferred = defer.Deferred()
        self.stdout = ""
        self.stderr = ""
        self.status = 0

    def connectionMade(self):
        self.transport.closeStdin()

    def outReceived(self, data):
        self.stdout += data

    def errReceived(self, data):
        self.stderr += data

    def processEnded(self, reason):
        if reason.check(error.ProcessDone):
            self.status = 0
            # pass the items we want down the callback chain
            self.deferred.callback((self.status, self.stdout, self.stderr))
        else:
            self.status = 1
            theError = errors.CmdError(self.cmd, self.status,
self.stdout, self.stderr)
            log.msg(theError)
            self.deferred.errback(theError)

def openProcess(cmd_and_args):
        cmd = cmd_and_args[0]
        args = cmd_and_args[1:]

        # Spawn the process using the reactor so we don't block
        proto = BasicProcessProtocol()
        proto.cmd = cmd_and_args
        reactor.spawnProcess(proto, cmd, cmd_and_args, env=os.environ)
        return proto.deferred

The win32event process support is known to be buggy. On Windows, popen
with a thread may be a better choice.

Crud!  It's been working for me for most everything else.

Did you add support to the default reactor to spawn threads on
Windows?  I thought I saw a closed bug related to this, but was
waiting for the next release to try it out.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] "Directory triggers" with kqueue using Twisted?
	(on MacOS X / FreeBSD)
Message-ID: <jm9g11k2edf1.sh9smuf4bnrz.dlg@40tude.net>

Hello,

recently I read something about the "kqueue" event notification mechanism
built into FreeBSD and that it would allow to receive notification when
filesystem contents change. Would this mechanism allow to implement a
similar function as database triggers for a filesystem, i.e. write a script
that does something with files that are added to, modified in or deleted
from a certain directory without having to poll the filesystem all the
time? Folder actions allow such things on MacOS X, but Applescript is slow
and I would prefer Python anyway. ;-) If so, is there a way to write such
scripts in Python using Twisted?

TIA,

Best regards

Wolfgang Keller

Actually Folder Actions don't allow this.  I am relatively certain that 
they are implemented entirely in Finder.  They *might* be hooked into 
at the CoreServices/Carbon APIs, but DEFINITELY NOT the BSD level APIs 
(in Mac OS X 10.3 and earlier anyway).

The kernel in Mac OS X 10.3.0 supports kqueue, so you can use it for 
this sort of thing -- but Finder still polls.  I do not know what is 
necessary to integrate this with Twisted, though.  There is some 
support for kqueue in Twisted, but last I remember you need to download 
and patch some years-old extension and compile it in order to get that 
to work.

Another thing of interest to you might be FAM

Thread support has always been fine on Windows.

James was showing some docs that said it doesn't actually support the

Is this still true in trunk?  I keep thinking that we've fixed this
issue and it keeps not being fixed.  What issue number is it?

If popen with a thread is a better choice, can we provide an
implementation of that that comes with the reactor so that at least
people don't have to rewrite their code?

I've seen it used in GraphViz and ReSTedit, so that's simply not true 
(for files anyway, not sure about directories).

Cory checked in fixed code and then backed it out.

Cory's code may have been similar to doing this.

Additionally, Apple has sample code that demonstrates this feature:

I was referring to Issue591, which based on the comments is done.  Can
anyone verify that?  Maybe I'll have to do a windows build instead of
wait for the next release.

Neato. Who wants to fix up kqreactor, and then write a cross-platform
file notification API that  uses kqueue when available?

I think Cory then backed the code out, so the bug ought to be reopened.

Save the above snippet to say www/perlsite.rpy and change the paths to 
be right for you.  Then run

 > mktap web --resource-script=www/perlsite.rpy
 > twistd -f ./web.tap

Never tried this myself, so .. hoping it works :)

good luck,

Actually I'm playing with kqreactor right now, but before starting
serious work on it need to settle on new py-kqueue API first.

Results of first attempts to change kqreactor are very promising.
For example reactor's Waker implemented using kqueue's timer is much
simpler and way faster than FIFO ping-pong. Timers can be used for
CallLater as well...

Make sure kqueue uses a decent algorithm. Using glib timers for
callLater is *slower* than using Python for large numbers, since glib
uses a stupid O(n) algorithm.

Keep us posted on your work, it sounds very useful.

Yes, I'm in contact with David.

BTW If anyone uses PyKQueue I can send my WIP to test.

Message-ID: <200501182247.43920.sflist@ihonk.com>

Hi!

In the PB howto, it mentions that it's typical and fine to get bidirectional 
synchronization between objects by inheriting from both pb.Copyable and 
pb.RemoteCopy. Is the case the same when it comes to Cacheable?

I want a client to log in and grab attributes of objects as needed from the 
server, and any changes made to the objects on either side ought to be 
replicated on the other end. This looks like the way to accomplish that, but 
I want to verify my suspicion before Twisted bends my brain again. :-)

Thanks!

I've wondered about it too, and after thinking about it I decided it was
a bad idea.  In the copy case (which works fine) you get a one-time copy
through serialization when doing remote methods.  In the Cacheable case
though, objects get changed on the other side due to changes on the one
side.

So in practice, what does that mean when side A changes the same object
as side B ? What do you do with conflicting changes ? It seems to me you
have no predictable way of resolving clashing changes.  So I ended up
not wanting to deal with those situations and worked around my need for
this.

Now, I do think in practice it will probably work, just not reliably and
very hard to debug when it doesn't do what you expected.  Write a small
test app and give it a try.

Yeah, my intent is to protect simultaneous changes through a locking 
mechanism, which will prevent one client from altering a record while another 
client is working on it. (If that sounds like row-level locking to you, 
you're right.) Of course, network latencies may allow a conflict to 
occasionally occur, in which case the conflict should be detected by the 
server and it will do the arbitration to enforce integrity.

But, of course, all this only works nicely if inheriting from Cacheable and 
RemoteCache is fine and dandy.

I was afraid you'd suggest that. :-)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] succeedForOneOf
Message-ID: <94a776e70501200824229dfd62@mail.gmail.com>

I wrote succeedForOneOf to help when I want to loop through a list and
call a function with the item from the list as the first argument to
the function, and stop when one of the function calls succeeds.  The
use case I need it for is, connecting to multiple servers looking for
a particular thing, and stopping when I find it.

In my testing in the attached file, succeedForOneOf does what I would
expect.  However, when I tried this in my application, and func
involved connecting to servers via PB and calling a remote method, it
started up a ton of 'PBClientFactory's until the win32eventreactor
spun wildly out of control because I exceeded the 64 object
limitation.  This of course also caused the server I was connecting to
to spin wildly out of control as well, sucking up all of the CPU.

My question isn't related to the win32event reactor problem.  I just
don't understand why my implementation of succeedForOneOf would fail
in this manner.  Does anyone see a problem with the code?  Has someone
else written code to accomplish this in a different way?

Well the answer was terribly obvious.  I needed to cache my
connections and reuse them instead of making new connections all the
time.  I was confused by the fact that this worked previously in my
code, but it has evolved some since then.  Anyway, the attached code
works fine.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Question on new code development
Message-ID: <1106322614.30599.11.camel@starbug.comcast.net>

I am in the process of building an interactive game server and client
with the client code written in Java and I have a couple of questions. I
am hoping to be up and running with a prototype in the next month. My
plans incluse the use of Twisted framework as I'm very comfortable in
Python as well as Java. 

My first question is, should I be looking at the new Twisted 2.0 for
development or stick with 1.3 and plan on upgrading to 2.0 later. 

Secondly, would using and/or building upon TwistedJava for the
communications between the Java clients and my Twisted server code be a
good direction to take?

Thanks,

They are compatible in the ways relevant to you, so I'd  start with 1.3.

Well... it works. But I'm not putting much effort into maintaining
TwistedJava these days. On the other hand if you find a serious bug I
will fix it.

How complex and varied is the data you will be sending back and forth?

Hi Bill (and everyone),

You might be interested to know that there's a Java package called Netty
(http://gleamynode.net/dev/projects/netty2/) that is very similar in
principle to Twisted, in that it allows you to write network clients and
servers in an efficient, event-based way.  I'm using it and have found it
very good - pretty simple to use and has been very reliable for me so far.
The scope of Netty isn't as large as Twisted, but the core of it is very
similar.

You might also like to read this paragraph on the future of Netty before you
start: http://gleamynode.net/dev/forum/viewtopic.php?t=87.

Regards, Jon

Hi everyone,

is there a way to use Zope as a client to Twisted PB ?
Background is that I have a nicely working application using Twisted. The GUI 
client is wxPython based and talks to the server part using PB.
Now I'd like to add a webinterface that would ideally use PB to to talk to my 
application server part and retrieve some of the information. 
Is that possible at all? Any pointers?

Thanks

The data is composed of interactive text streams, Java types/classes
(representing mouse movements, etc) and binary data (jpg/png type data).
I can convert the  data to a "neutral" format (such as xdr) and build
communication data structures to encapsulate it if needed but if the
TwistedJava code does this already I'm that much further ahead. Keeping
the data streams in a Java native format "seems" like a good way to go
but the Python code will need to use the data as well and I'm not that
far along with what the difference between a Java String and Python
String (repeat this for each Java native type) are.

TwistedJava will do the expected conversion by default (so e.g. String
to unicode string in python, ArrayList to list, Integer from/to python
int, etc..). It's lossy going from Python to Java though (can't make
Java ints, only Integers with the default objects,), so you'll need to
write some custom code to create java arrays, but not too much.

PB + zope is messy, you would need to run a reactor in a zope thread.

A zope uri is a valid xml-rpc object whos methods are callable using
xml-rpc + basic auth. twisteds xml-rpc client support lacks basic auth
even though the underlying xml-rpc library supports it. We patched it
up at work but our patch was pretty hacky and not implemented at the
layer that it should be to merge into twisted. 

I guess you could:

a) only invoke methods without security properties set on them in zope
b) fix up twisteds xml-rpc client to do basic auth well
c) ask me for the patch we use and see if its helpful (I doubt it) 

I like the sound of b :)

Ok, good. I'll do some playing around with it this weekend using our
Java client prototype. 

Thanks for the help, I'll let you know how it progresses.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] [noob][Q] Is Twisted the right tool for my job?
Message-ID: <20050122154808.37314.qmail@web54310.mail.yahoo.com>

I am fairly experienced with Python (I also use wxPython a lot), and I have a fair amount of
experience with TCP/IP in terms of mechanics and troubleshooting.  I have almost no experience in
network programming.

I am working on a computer graphics application (Python/C++ hybrid) which demands a lot of CPU
time.  I am in the planning stages of converting it to distribute the work over many computers on
the same local network (although I would eventually like to expand that as well).

There will be a main computer which checks to see who is available to participate.  That main
computer will also be helping with the processing load.  After that, it is basically all computers
sending out either requests for information or sending data in response to a request (data can
also be sent unsolicited).

So I guess my question is--is Twisted more than what I need?  I am sure it will do the job.  I
have read quite a bit of material on the web site already.  But would it be faster and easier to
just code this by hand or to use some other network programming framework/development tool?

Thanks!!!
Todd

Of course it is, and all for the better. At the same time, it's
*exactly* what you need. :-)

And you are probably right.

It most probably wouldn't, since you state not having much experience in
network programming.

None there I know of, in the Python world, and maybe elsewhere too.
Perspective Broker alone is a dream come true, for distributed applications.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0501231042170.29938-100000@naskur.se.linux.org>

I'm thinking about implementing an application that can browse
filesystems (through ssh,ftp etc), databases, snmp mibs, zip/tar/gz
files, a little toolbox where you can do all kinds of stuff with an mc
like interface. Did anyone implement this already?

I've checked the examples on the twistedmatrix site and all protocols
like ssh, ftp, imap seem to have their own interface. IMHO, a common
interface for browsing would be nice, something like VFS (e.g. Gnome
VFS). With Gnome VFS you have the same interface for webdav, ftp, gzip,
cdda and others.

Also, IMHO, simpleftpclient.py and simplesshclient.py should differ only
one or very few lines, the authentication part. Everything else should
be the same.

Am I making sense? What do you think about this?

Tim

You're saying that VFS is a good idea and that I should implement it?
As I'm no twisted guru I'd like some guidance, please. Has this been
thought about before? Is something like this considered for 2.0? Are
there any difficulties implementing it?

At some stage this year I'll be implementing a related thing for work,
most probably given back to twisted; A twisted VFS server, the concept
will be to provide a simple tree that represents a filesystem, which
will then be published via webDAV (which we will implement for twisted),
FTP, sambaVFS etc.. I guess this is the opposite of what your takling
about, your interested in a client to other existing services.

The reason I bring this up is that they seem like two halves of the same
project.

Hmmm ... are you saying there's a webdav-package coming in a
soon-to-be-released update of the Twisted-package? Based on akadav or
something else?

WabDav is probably the only thing I miss in Twisted. Well, that and
perhaps better ( if it works at all ) support for ICQ.

BTW: Any hint on how to communicate to ICQ-users would be highly interesting.

Best regards,

no I'm saying that at 'some stage this year' I'll be doing this stuff
for work, The plan was to implement webdav on top of twisted.web2 when
it settled down, but if akaDAV does webDAV for twisted already we will
just use that :) (I hadn't heard of akaDAV till today, and our focus is
VFS not DAV so YAY for whoever wrote this for me)

also, I'm not a twisted hacker so I cant say what will/will not be
bundled with the twisted package.

Only one hint for you, please make sure to run all fs calls with a
thread pool, and never do a vfs call that doesn't support poll(2) within
the main twisted thread. All I/O calls are synchronous and they block
the main thread completely. Best would be to support kernel
asynchronous I/O natively in the reactor, but that depends on linux at
least, so having a posix threaded abstraction for aio would be ok even
if lower performant than kernel aio (note that the kernel is going to
use threads too for aio, the only advantage is that they're kernel
threads instead of user threads, so with multiple apps and not only
twisted running, they can save some tlb flush, plus there is some other
advantage, but having threaded aio inside twisted without kernel support
would be already pretty good).

I'm working on this, but as an aside from web2, which is an aside from

My problem:
I trying to instal on Mandrake linux 10 (run all patches) and for some reason my Python 2.3 directory does not have the config/makefile in it, could I just copy this from somewhere?

You need to install the Python2.3 devel package for mandrake. IIRC,
it's called python2.3-devel, or something along those lines. :-)

Why don't you just use the Mandrake package for twisted ? It's in the
"contrib" repository.
If you don't know how to configure an external repository, see

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Importing twisted.names.client blocks
Message-ID: <41F65EDC.3040106@brainbot.com>

Hi,

I started testing a program today which imported twisted.names.client. 
On every second run, the program didn't return from the import and hung 
for some time (until I pressed some key, strange...). Turns out, that I 
don't have Crypto installed and twisted.protocol.dns then tries to read 
2 bytes from
/dev/random, /dev/srandom, and /dev/urandom (in that order, until first 
success) in order to determine a random source. If it succeeds with one 
of those devices, it will also use that method later to read a random 
integer.
The man page for urandom (on linux+fbsd) tells me that /dev/random is 
for 'uses that  need  very  high quality randomness such as one-time pad 
or key generation' and that reads to /dev/random will block when the 
entropy  pool  is  empty.
In contrast /dev/urandom will not block, but it's output may be analyzed 
by an attacker ('Knowledge  of  how  to  do this is not available in the 
current non-classified liter?ature'...but then that linux man page is 
very old...).
I suggest that the usage of /dev/random should be stopped. If it doesn't 
bite you on import, it will do so later, when you're doing lots of dns 
request (a coworker of mine had written http crawler and told me, that 
it started getting slower after 3 hours or so, guess that was the time 
when /dev/random ran out of entropy). After all, when none of those 
devices is available, the code will also fallback to using random.randint.

Any thoughts on serving compressed HTTP.  I didn't see anything in 
twisted to do this out of the box.  Do I need to create a new reactor?  
Here are some use cases:

if a user-agent accepts compressed data

- compress static content
- compress static content, caching the result somewhere
- return compressed "memory" data.
- return compressed dynamic data

- return compressed dynamic data only when certain mime types are supplied.

I'm pretty sure there's a  bug open for this in

Web questions should be asked on the twisted-web mailing list. A couple
of people have implemented this already, I think (possibly gzstream at
http://undefined.org/python/ is one). The twisted-web list should be
able to point you at any.

Don't bother with it, it's useless, I wasn't thinking when I added it.

Hello every one...I start using twisted matrix and

realativly easy but it seems every once in a wille the

something like that, also I like to use some sort of

You can have code that runs everytime an exception is logged:

twisted.python.log.addObserver(f)

f(aDict) will be called for every logged message, including
exceptions/failures. Just make sure f() doesn't raise exceptions itself
or it will get removed.

If you have code that crashes the *reactor*, i.e. twisted quits, that's
a bug in twisted and you should add a report ot
http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/.

when I say that crashes the *reactor* i mean that the
server borke the conection with the client(the
protocol  crahses acording with i understud) but
others clients later are unhable to connect (in the
server dos-box continuosly showing a traceback)

PS: thaks for the micro-example, I just read about the
log class and don't know where get simple exmaples.
Any sujestions.

If you are running on Windows and your DOS prompt is filling up with
tracebacks, it is probably the 64 object limitation with the
win32event reactor.  I do my best to avoid that problem by only
allowing a certain number of tasks to happen at the same time, using a
semaphore.  You can try another reactor if you don't need to call
spawnProcess (see http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/issue591).

Hi,

In this source (part of the tutorial at

When you run it, it does nothing and exits. Could somebody let me know what

Thanks,

The consensus in the past has been that a wiki wouldn't help much.  Search
the archives for details.

We're keen to help make the documentation better -- please feel free to file
bugs at http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs, and set the topic to "documentation".
If you want to draft changes or new docs, you can also file those there.

Also, the latest howtos and examples built from SVN head can be found here:
    http://twistedmatrix.com/users/warner/doc-latest

But if you get stuck -- please, ask.  This mailing list and the IRC channel
are happy to help answer your questions.  Eventually we get tired of
answering some questions over and over, and we turn those into proper
documentation ;)

-Andrew.

This example is misnamed -- it should be copy_receiver.tac.  "tac" stands
for "Twisted Application Configuration", and is run with "twistd -y".
twistd doesn't actually care what the file's extension is, so you can run it
with:

    twistd -noy copy_receiver.py

(see the twistd(1) man page and the twisted.application howto:
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/howto/application)

I'll fix the docs to make this clearer.

Why? This below workaround make my software working again. I assume I
must be missing something, otherwise I don't see the point of disabling
packages without giving a command line switch to force a full install.
(I did a quick search but I couldn't find a way to install without
backing out the ignore switch)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Problem with ClientFactory
Message-ID: <200501261657.14178@tintia.doriath>

Hi,

I've been writing a small client program connecting to the server through 
SSL when occurred a strange problem. At the beginning I thought that it was 
my fault, I changed my mind after examining examples (exactly 
echoclient_ssl.py) shipped with the Twisted distribution, though. After 
many try-and-fails I think I found the problematic code. I created this 
test case to show the issue:
#v+
from OpenSSL import SSL
from twisted.internet.protocol import ClientFactory
from twisted.protocols.basic import LineOnlyReceiver

class Protocol(LineOnlyReceiver):
    def connectionMade(self):
        self.sendLine("GET / HTTP/1.0\n")

    def lineReceived(self, line):
        print line

class Factory(ClientFactory):
    protocol = Protocol
    def startedConnecting(self, connector):
        print "Connecting..."

    def buildProtocol(self, addr):
        print "Connected."

    def clientConnectionLost(self, connector, reason):
        print "Connection Lost."
        reactor.stop()

    def clientConnectionFailed(self, connector, reason):
        print "Connection Failed."
        reactor.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    host = "sf.net"
    port = 443
    from twisted.internet import reactor, ssl
    reactor.connectSSL(host, port, Factory(), ssl.ClientContextFactory())
    reactor.run()
#v-

After running this code I get "Connecting, Connected" lines and long 
tracebacks warning about two exceptions (I could attach it, if it was 
useful).

$ rpm -q python-Twisted python-pyOpenSSL; uname -o
python-Twisted-1.3.0-7
python-pyOpenSSL-0.6-2
PLD Linux

The most interesting (funny?) thing with this problem is the simplest 
workaround - after removing startedConnecting and buildProtocol methods of 
Factory class everything works fine, I get the response from the server and 
requested page. Is that meant to (not)work that way? If so, please write it 
somewhere in the HOWTO using big letters, otherwise let somebody fix 
it. ;-)

P.S. HTTPS is just an example. I know about dedicated software for that 
purpose, but it's useless for me. ;-) I'm just wondering about the cause of 
this problem.

Yes, 2.0 is going to have separate downloads for separate packages
(along with a one-in-all download, of course), so the distutils code is
currently work in progress.

The problem is you overrode buildProtocol. Default buildProtocol returns
self.protocol(), but if you override it you need to create and return a
protocol instance yourself.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] dramatic slowdown in pbbenchclient.py /
	pbbenchserver.py
Message-ID: <41F7E610.6050601@agilityfund.com>


Hello, there's a dramatic slowdown in the number of calls per second in 
the pbbenchclient.py /  pbbenchserver.py programs 
(http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/examples/) if I just change 
the number of deferred calls from two to three, and make the connection 
between two different computers.  With the stock program, I get around 
900 cps, with the modified one, I get around 5 cps.  I'm a newbie, so 
maybe something is going on that I'm not understanding.  Anyway, here 
are the pseudo-diffs in pbbenchclient.py:

<< hostname = 'localhost'
 >> hostname = '192.168.0.2'

and

<< d1 = self.persp.callRemote("simple")
<< d2 = self.persp.callRemote("complexTypes")
<< defer.DeferredList(l).addCallback(self.callLoop)

 >> l=[self.persp.callRemote("simple") for x in range(3)]
 >> defer.DeferredList(l).addCallback(self.callLoop)

The slowdown only appears between two different computers.  If I run it 
on a single computer I get 700 cps.  If I run it between two separate 
computers but with one or two simultaneous deferreds, then there's only 
a very minor slowdown.  I'm running on windows 2000 with 
Twisted-1.3.0.win32-py2.3.exe. 

What do you think?  Is this a strange behaviour of twisted or is there 
something screwed up with my networking?

Cheers, -Russ

It is possible this is due to the immediate-write behavior of twisted 
1.3 combined with the TCP Nagle algorithm. You could try calling 
transport.setTcpNoDelay(True) on both ends (the client and the server 
end) to see if that helps.

Indeed. I should have checked the sources first. Anyway, thanks for info.

Unfortunately, just after fixing above problem, I occurred one really 
annoying "feature". When I try to connect to a host/port which doesn't 
support SSL connections, I receive an exception which I can't catch. The 
traceback looks like this:
#v+

Is it possible to catch it? I put a try...except statement near the reactor 
calls, but it didn't work. I was trying to find somewhere else an answer to 
my question, however I failed after a couple of hours of searching.

I'm not saying it's a big problem, but it "doesn't look nice" and a good 
program shouldn't behave in this way.

Ok, now I'm feeling quite clueless.  I guessed that "transport" refers 
to myPBClientFactory.protocol.transport (for the client case).  But this 
is set to None and never changes.  Where is the underlying transport 
stored in PBClientFactory and PBServerFactory?

   I fear I'm missing something basic and overlooked something already
   documented.  Hopefully someone will set me straight.  I'm attempting
   to play with MoinMoin using twisted as the webserver.  I'm running on
   linux using python 2.3.4 and twisted 1.3.0 as a nonroot user.  When I
   attempt to start MoinMoin, I see the following in the log:

I am seeing the same problem with an online tutorial system being
developed here at MIT.  The problem is directly related to the use of
AFS, which adds two high-numbered groups to the user's list, as
reported by "id -G".  If I authenticate using standard passwords,
those groups aren't present and Twisted starts fine.

This is an urgent problem for us.  Next week, we will start teaching a
class that uses this system.  Since AFS is in widespread use here at
MIT, the students will be using AFS for their home directories.

I'd like to get this fixed, either by some kind of patch, or by a
workaround.  Does anyone on the list have any ideas about this?

The only thing I can think of doing is to change initgroups to filter
out the bad groups.

Thanks,
Chris

The right fix is to never try to change or verify the groups list when 
not instructed to change userids. Currently twistd defaults its uid/gid 
arguments to the current user's UID/GID, and attempts to 
setuid/setgid/initialize groups appropriately, which is silly. See also 
http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/issue600.

A quick fix is to comment out twisted/scripts/twistd.py:160:     
shedPrivileges(config['euid'], process.uid, process.gid)
which is useless when not running as root.

That would be great.  It turns out my problem is/was the same as the
folks at MIT.  My linux box is an AFS client.  A person in my
department that is our resident AFS expert informed me that AFS uses
the first 2 group slots to store the AFS PAG (Process Authentication
Group) identifier for the user.  This is for 2.4 and older kernels.  I
don't know if it is the same for 2.6 kernels.  I know the OpenAFS
folks are in the process of redoing PAGs because of 2.6 kernel
changes.

For now.  Commenting out the the call to shedPrivileges works for me.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] tac and tap in the same file
Message-ID: <20050129144339.GC10440@opteron.random>

While I appreciate the tweaking of the tap file for production usage,
during development it's more handy to use a tac file and avoid the
pickling that otherwise would happen too frequently for every test.

By adding these lines at the end of the tap.py file I can run both tac
and tap from the same file by using tap.py instead like if it was a tac
file (started with twistd -noy)

It wasn't obvious immediatly that it was possible.

I only had to add these lines at the end of tap.py (tap.py like in
finger example of the howto):

s = web.make_service(Options())
from twisted.application import service
application = service.Application('cpushare_web')
s.setServiceParent(service.IServiceCollection(application))

This takes all option defaults just fine (like if mktap was run without
tweaking parameters). I believe a cut and paste shoud work for most tap
files if they follow the same naming of the Options class.

I didn't see this trick mentioned in the docs, so JFYI.

Personally I feel mktap should not be used until we come up with a
better runtime configuration system. TACs seem like the best deployment
method, for now.

Hey folks,

There are some loose plans floating around for a Twisted Sprint in
Hobart Australia, and we'd like some feedback from people who are likely
to attend, for planning purposes.

Date: Likely to be three days, including a Saturday and Sunday, in
either late March or early April 2005.

Location: Hobart, Australia.

If you're even vaguely likely to be able to attend such a thing, can you
reply to me off-list and let me know. Include a preference for a
particular weekend during that time if you have any.

I heard that, but I didn't want to reinvent the wheel on the -u/-g and
Options() parameters that are already handled by mktap.

For deployment taps seems ok too since the slow pickling happens only
once in a while. OTOH for testing I use the defaults of Options and I
don't use -u/-g (I run on ports >1024 with the Options() defaults), so I
can avoid the pickling during testing.

So doing both tac and tap in the same file seems a quite handy solution
for me. I mentioned it just because the howto didn't mention it but in
practice it's what I find more handy to use ;).

It's possible to set uid and gid in TACs. Just needs better
documentation. Also arguably those options ought to be twistd, not
mktap/tacs :/

This is exactly the point, they ought to be twistd. I know I can set uid
and gid as parameter to the application, but I'd need to change
sourcecode to do that, the point of reconfiguring is to avoid changing
sourcecode.

The Options() are the same problem. I don't want to reinvent a
configuration method when the Options with mktap already exists.

So even all Options() I can give to mktap should be available through
twistd the same way -u/-g should be available to twistd.

It probably can be implemented in a backwards compatible fascion, and I
probably won't have to change a single bit on my app, after those
Options() are moved from mktap to twistd. The Options API already exists
for mktap, we've only to extend it to the tac file too.

Anyway as said for now the mktap is ok for deployment where recreating
the tap file happens not frequently at all, but I'd also prefer to avoid
the pickling since I'm not getting any advantage from the tap file at
all and it only wastes some cpu.

Thanks.

I've thrown together some tarballs with my latest release automation
code. You can download them here:

http://twistedmatrix.com/users/radix/2.0/

Please download the packages relevant to you and give them a test.
You'll need to install Twisted-2.0.0a1 before any of the other
subproject packages in there, and it depends on zope.interface being
installed, which I haven't bothered including yet.

If anybody's interested in making packages for their OS, now's the
time to start working on it.

Thanks!

Message-ID: <6C5F0F3099DC5B45B87D78EE2A37830D1AC8DC@ukhkm001.edsadewd.edl.uk.eds.com>

I'm using twisted.names (DNS server) but have a need to do updates (see
nsupdate).

I've already done some work on this (which I plan to submit in due course),
but wondered:

a) Is anyone else working on updates (wouldn't want to duplicate efforts)?

b) Is there some fundamental reason why I shouldn't do this?

Hey Mary,

Just making a vague expression of interest.  I'm up in cairns atm but it 
  would a great thing to get involved with.  What level of twisted 
competence do you think will be required?

No preference for dates.

thanks,
Andy.

I'll answer on-list: I don't really have a good sense of how much
Twisted competance you'd need. What the sprint would be hacking on
hasn't been at all finalised. My feeling is probably that Python
competance would be enough and the sprint itself could teach you the
relevant bits of Twisted for whatever the topic was.

Alternatively, you could show up with your own project and benefit it by
picking people's brains a bit.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Interactive Twisted client (newbie question?)
Message-ID: <1104793201.41d9ce715e8e8@www.nerc-essc.ac.uk>

Hi all,

I'm new to Twisted, and I'm trying to create an implementation of a client
program that communicates over a network with a server using a protocol called
Styx.  (In case you're interested, Styx is a protocol for distributed systems,
as used by the Inferno operating system:
http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/styx.html.)  In short, Styx is a pretty
simple call-response type of protocol, in which the client sends a T-message
and waits for the corresponding R-message from the server.  There is a
one-to-one correspondence between T- and R-messages.

I understand that Twisted is an event-driven framework and I have written a
basic client program.  My initial attempt has involved creating a StyxProtocol
class that inherits from protocol.Protocol, in which I override key methods
such as dataReceived() and connectionMade().  Having created this protocol and
told it how to respond to messages that arrive, I created a simple Factory
class, then set the whole thing running with reactor.run().  It works fine, but
it's not quite in the form I'd like.  In my current attempt, what I've done is
essentially to create a load of callbacks and "press GO".  Once I've set the
program running I can't interact with it until one of the methods calls
reactor.stop().

What I'd like to be able to do is illustrated by the following pseudo-Python. 
This could be a script or could be typed into an interactive Python shell:

conn = StyxConnection("myserver.remotehost.com", 6666)
conn.connect() # Starts the reactor going and performs handshakes
# The connection is now open and I can interact with it
myRemoteFile = conn.openFile("/path/to/myfile") # Gets handle to file on remote
server, by exchange of a few messages
data = myRemoteFile.read() # Reads data from the remote file, again by exchange
of some messages
conn.close() # Closes the connection to the remote server and stops the reactor

How can I do this with the Twisted framework?  As far as I can tell,
reactor.run() will not return until something calls reactor.stop().  I could
achieve what I want using threads (I think), but I'd like to avoid this if
possible.

I'm sure I'm not the first to ask this sort of question, but I've looked through
the docs and example code and haven't been able to track down an answer.  I'd
be very grateful for any pointers that anyone could offer.

Regards,
Jon

According to distrowatch.com, all recent releases of gobolinux have at least
Python 2.2, so any version of Twisted should work just fine.  I'd recommend
the current release, 1.3.0.

A Gobolinux mailing list sounds like a better place to ask such a question.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] nevow.compy.CannotAdapt: WovenContext...
Message-ID: <1104874643.31904.249.camel@6 webmail.nil8r.net 

I copied some code from an existing site of mine to a new machine and
boom.... does not work anymore :) the code is based on the guard
example... I actually went on to remove more and more of my code till I
realized that even with the basic example itself it fails after the user
logged in :

It seems the code that fails is:

def render_sessionId(self, context, data):
		sess = inevow.ISession(context)
		return context.tag[sess.uid]

The complete trace follows. Any ideas? I probably forget to install
something... did I?

this is gentoo standard ebuilds for python, twisted and nevow:

Message-ID: <1104876260.22279.11.camel@flocke.chester.at>

Hi TwistedListUsers,

ive started to work with twisted, and learned from the howtos/docs on
the webpage.

I got a little bit confused on trying to understand how components work
in twisted as describe on
"http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/howto/components"

ive tryed the HairDryer Example and got wrong as the expected 
"AdaptToAmericanSocket" didnt work as described in the example.

as my understanding of this the example code of the HairDryer Class
is wrong, as it should call
"assert socket.voltage() == 110, 'BOOM'" 
as
"assert adapted.voltage() == 110, 'BOOM'"

which makes the example work as expected.

if im wrong please correct me and point me to my miss understanding of
the example and components.

thanks,
kind regards
Michael Lang

Known bug, fixed in SVN:
    http://twistedmatrix.com/users/warner/doc-latest/core/howto/components.html

Now's probably a good time to remind people that you can see the development
version of the howtos here, updated after every commit:

This is why I often suggest the use of 'twistd' for running your Twisted
code - the reactor.run() call is confusing, because it makes it seem as
though it's your code's responsibility to start and stop the reactor,
and possibly to do things before or after that has happened.

Even if you need to start the reactor yourself - for example, if you are
writing a GUI program - it is best to abstract out the reactor
start/stop far from your application code.

If I understand the core of your question correctly, it's "How do I use
Twisted at the interactive Python interpreter?"

There is no easy answer.  Twisted is not well-suited towards use at a
normal Python prompt, because the normal Python prompt is not
event-driven.  There have been a few different forays into interactive
Python/Twisted integration.  The 1.3.0 release includes a 'manhole'
client/server pair which will allow you to log in and run python code
inside a running Twisted process.  JP Calderone has recently done quite
a bit of work on a new, better interactive interpreter (including SSH
access and command-line editing) which looks more like a regular Python
prompt.

Although there are several different avenues you can take to get there,
what you probably want to arrive at is a Twisted server that is
listening on one port for Python commands, and on another for whatever
protocol it is you are trying to implement.  For convenience, it may be
useful for the "port" that it's listening on to actually be standard
I/O.  This is possible using twisted.internet.stdio.

Hi Glyph,

Thanks very much for your reply, very useful.  I've had another think about my
problem and I guess it boils down to this question: when I'm writing a client
program, how can I simulate a synchronous function call (avoiding callbacks)
like this pseudo-Python, which sends a message then returns its reply:

def sendMessage(message):
   transport.send(message)
   # Wait for reply to arrive
   reply = getReplySomehow()
   return reply

In the protocol I am implementing, I expect most messages to be replied to
immediately by the server so this function would not block for long (I'm only
writing a simple, naive client at the moment).  The event-driven model seems to
me to be great for implementing servers, but a little more awkward for
implementing simple client programs.  Is this comment fair?

I can see how I would implement the above pseudo-function using threads (indeed
I have done so in Java) - perhaps this is my only option to avoid blocking?

Thanks,
Jon

  One way is to have getReplySomehow() context switch out of sendMessage() 
and into something capable of constructing getReplySomehow()'s return 
value, then switching back and returning it to be bound to the name reply.

  Twisted has ignore this rather successfully up until recently.  It is,
after all, a basic language feature, and should be provided by the runtime.
Nothing about it is Twisted specific, and it is perfectly possible to write
a Twisted program without this trick.

  Recently Chris Armstrong's "deferred generator" support was added to 
t.i.defer, though.  With it, you write code something like this:

    from twisted.internet import defer

    def sendMessage(message):
        transport.send(message)
        intermediate = defer.waitForDeferred(getReplySomehow())
        yield intermediate
        reply = intermediate.getResult()
        yield reply
    sendMessage = deferredGenerator(sendMessage)

  This supposes that getReplySomehow() returns a Deferred, and causes
sendMessage to also return a Deferred (one which fires with reply 
eventually).  The benefit is not immediately obvious here, since you 
are handing reply back to your caller, rather than using it.  The exact
equivalent code without this technique is:

    def sendMessage(message):
        transport.send(message)
        return getReplySomehow()

  However, there is some benefit if, instead of returning reply, sendMessage
uses it locally a bit.

  There are other solutions, of course.  You can use pre-emptive threads,
as provided by Python's threading module (or Twisted's thin layer on top
of it).  Keep in mind that there is pretty much only one threadsafe API in
Twisted (callInThread).  If you do this, you will have to be extremely 
careful not to call Twisted APIs from the wrong place.  There is an example 
of a somewhat generic implementation of this solution in my sandbox.  
It gives the appearance of working (and may even do so), but consider it 
untested and loaded with bugs (I'm certainly not using it in any of my 
software).

  Greenlets are another solution along these lines.  They simply replace
pre-emptive kernel threads with cooperative user-space threads.  As such,
you do not need to worry about calling Twisted APIs from the wrong thread,
since there is no wrong thread.  Greenlets are implemented with some tricky
voodoo, so once again, while I know of no bugs, I also wouldn't be surprised
if using them caused a rift in space/time to open up and eat your head.

  So what's a Python programmer to do?  Well, the technique I'll actually 
recommend is the simplest: callbacks.  Oh, they're a pain to write sometimes,
but they're much less magic than the other solutions described, often perform
better, and all the bugs you'll get when using them are the simple to fix kind,
rather than the my-stack-just-got-swizzled-time-to-segv or the 
oh-there's-a-race-that-only-triggers-under-load-on-someone-else's-machine kind.
They also lead to rather more modular code than the synchronous-style equivalents.
You can unit test a callback by itself.  How do you unit test lines 7 - 11 of a
single function?

  As to your wondering about Twisted's utility for clients versus servers, I 
think you are close to the truth.  The actual divide, though, is concurrency.
If your program only needs to do one thing at a time, Twisted doesn't simplify
much.  If your program needs to do two or more things at once, then it does.
Keep in mind that, even for a client, there are often at least two things that
need to be happening: talking to the network and updating the user interface.

  Hope this helps,

  Jp

Hi Jon,

Interesting that you are implementing Styx with Twisted, I used to
work with Inferno and its father 9P (plan9) back during my Lucent
days.

Are you creating just creating a twisted Styx protocol client to use
with the vitanuova styx server or are you looking to do a server in
twisted as well? Let me know if you are redoing the styx server as
well in twisted, but back to your original problem question...

Keeping thing nice an simple, the pythonic way, I did a similar thing
in Twisted, but using a different method.. From what I can tell from
your post is you *really* want is a twisted styx client that sends
T-messages to a styx server to serve its namespace with R-messages,
and *you* want to interact with the client synchronously.. You also
asked for a better way to implement the client not using callbacks,
but that was not the real issue. For _you_ the real issue is
synchronously communicating _with_the_styx_client from a command
line..

If this assumption is correct then all you have to do is make the styx
client a server as well, for let's say the telnet protocol. Then you
can use a telnet client to connect to the telnet server (which is also
the styx client) and bingo issue commands to the styx server (via the
styx client that is also the telnet server)... Of course you will have
to pass the styx server messages back to the telnet client

Let me know if that answers you problem..

There is even an example in the howto's to setup both a client and
server from one factory

Cheers,

Anthony

As JP mentioned, you can also use twisted.internet.stdio to provide a 
command line interface to your running Twisted application.  I'm 
attaching a simple app that illustrates the point.  Here's an example 
session:

$ python stdiodemo.py
Web checker console. Type 'help' for help.
help
Valid commands: check help quit
help check
check <url>: Attempt to download the given web page
check http://www.fettig.net/
Success: got 26072 bytes.
check http://www.fettig.net/nonexistant_page
Failure: 404 Not Found
check http://not.a.real.site/
Failure: DNS lookup failed: address 'not.a.real.site' not found.
quit
Goodbye.

stdiodemo.py takes commands from standard input while the reactor is 
running. When you type "check <url>", it kicks off an asyncronous task 
(downloading the web page), and prints the result when it is finished.

Anthony's suggestion of using a Telnet server could work here too - 
there are only a couple minor changes you'd need to make to run this as 
a telnet server.

Is that helpful?

Nice example of stdio, LineReceived, and using deferreds!  Abe, can we
include this example in Twisted?

It's very similar the the standard Python 'cmd' module - it might be worth
mentioning this as part of the example.

Thanks, I'm glad you like it!  You're certainly welcome to include it 
(or a modified version) in Twisted.

One potential addition would be a command line flag to have it run as a 
  server instead of using stdio.  That might be a nice way to 
demonstrate how the same protocol can be used on stdio or in a server.

Hello,

I just committed code that fixed issue827. I think I also fixed another bug in the wrapping, but I'm not certain.

Here's the story. msg() split the privmsg text into chunks the size of (max_octets_per_line - len(fmt) - 2); fmt = 'PRIVMSG username :%s'. This means that ignoring line endings, each line sent will be at least 4 characters shorter than max_octets_per_line -- 2 for '%s', 2 for the '-2'. I don't know why the '- 2' was there.

In my commit, I took the '%s' into account, and still subtract 2 from the message chunk size. This means that the (undocumented) behaviour has changed. 

I don't really know the IRC protocol, so I don't know what line endings are sent, or whether they are relevant in the protocol API. If someone will enlighten me, I will correct code, docstrings, tests and comments accordingly.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Deferred style question.
Message-ID: <200501072040.29199.anthony@interlink.com.au>

Say I have an operation that takes a certain amount of time, and so I 
return a deferred. While the operation is still in progress, another call is 
made for the same operation.

The operation is one of those only-do-once-and-cache-the-results sort of 
things. If an operation is called a second time after the first one is done, 
defer.succeed(previousResult) is returned. If it's called a second time 
while it's still in progress, it returns a deferred that's also triggered with
the result when the operation completes.

Should I just return the same deferred?

Initially I thought 'yes, return the same deferred', but that then relies on 
the user-written callback returning the result that it was passed.

Second thought was 'no, return a new deferred', and return a new deferred and 
install a callback on the original deferred that triggers a new deferred

But then if the user's callback on the original deferred raises an error, the 
second deferred will never be triggered. Or it could simply return another
deferred, and delay the triggering of the second one.

So now I'm leaning towards (on the first call) making two deferreds - one for 
the operation, and one to be returned to the user. Then the operation 
deferred gets a callback that triggers the user's deferred. Then a second 
user call can simply add a new callback to the operation deferred. Any later
calls simply add a callback to the (cached) operation deferred, they'll be 
triggered immediately.

Does this make sense? Sample code to demonstrate what I mean is attached.

After I posted the previous, two obvious points occurred to me:

  1. This is easy enough to modify to a generally useful 'DeferredCache'
      class
  2. Said class is a nice example of a decorator <wink>

So, see the attached for a DeferredCache decorator. It's not perfect,
because it currently doesn't do keyword arguments, and all arguments
to the operation must be hashable. This could be fixed, although it 
would make the code a bit nastier.

It's funny that you are using a decorator, but not the __contains__ 
operator ;)

Pah! Here's a final version for now, fixed to work for methods and 
also supporting errbacks, as well as kwargs and unhashable arguments. 
The previous version didn't work for methods, because I was trying to be 
too clever. 

This is checked into shtoom (on a branch at the moment, since that's where 
I need it). If people like, I can check it into the twisted sandbox somewhere 
as well...

If it's considered a good idea, I'm happy for this to go into twisted proper.
Now that I've got it, there's going to be a whole pile of places I can use
this.

I would change the "if not opdef" to "if opdef is None", because it's a 
little faster and more precise.

Well, I think this or something like it should go in.  I've been using 
this idiom for years, actually.

Hey All,

When reading this know that I'm not really a python
programmer (last time was too long ago)

I posted fink info file for twisted, buildbot, and a
couple others here:

http://schwehr.org/software/fink/

No one has expressed any interest and since I do not
have the time to figure out buildbot for my project
(density), I am going to drop the info files.

If you do have interest in these files, please let me
know and if they work for you, I can easily add them
to the fink cvs tree.  I don't really know if they are
ok or not.  Otherwise, I will just leave them on my
web page and not put them into fink.

Or, if someone has a simple tutorial of setting up
buildbot (for the clueless) with only one machine that
has local only cvs and does the builds too with just a
simple make command, then if I can get buildbot
working pretty quickly then I would add these fink
packages.

I'd agree - we have similar scenarios and this is the same approach

Sorry on the delay - holidays and then I forgot about it :-(

I'm still on the fence with respect to having independent "jellyable"
checks.  My concern would be that having the independent checks of
what is suitable for jellying can be fragile with respect to coupling
with the actual jelly operation.  Even with the jellyable and security
checks there are some paths in the jellier code that could still fail
the operation.

I also think I liked your earlier attempts at keeping the change
within the CopyableFailure class (I may have missed why that changed),
although even there you'd have a double jelly since you'd have to
check the jelly attempt in getStateToCopy.  Although alternatively,
CopyableFailure could just implement its own jellyFor (rather than
getStateToCopy) which handled that more gracefully and with a single
jelly attempt on the value.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] how to create a http proxy client in twisted?
Message-ID: <20050108084630.6566.qmail@web15705.mail.cnb.yahoo.com>

is there any example?

which example in TwistedDocs\examples\Proxy.py just
like that:

from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.web import proxy, server

site =
server.Site(proxy.ReverseProxyResource('www.yahoo.com',
80, '/'))
reactor.listenTCP(8080, site)
reactor.run()

what's that means?

Once I'd written it down, I went back and found I'd done something 
similar, but not quite as general, on any number of previous occasions.

I think it really should go in - so, the obvious question is: what else 
needs to be done to put it in? The current version in shtoom svn 
supports a couple of different options - whether to allow unhashable
arguments (in which case no caching is done), whether to cache only
operations in progress, or cache all operations. It also supports a 
cache clearing method, and works nicely as either a 2.4-style 
decorator, or an older style decorator. There's unittests (although it
still needs tests for the .errback handling, will be added shortly).

Current code is at 
http://divmod.org/cvs/branches/improved-stun/shtoom/defcache.py?root=Shtoom&view=markup

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Interactive Twisted client (newbie question?)
In-Reply-To: <20050106003505.GH7521@localhost.localdomain>
Message-ID: <000e01c4f71b$65d6a540$76a6abc0@marlow>

Hi all,

Thanks for everyone who replied with help on this issue.  After much
head-scratching I decided that Twisted was not the right framework for my
particular app and I solved my problem another way.  The idea of running a
Twisted app with a Telnet or stdio interface is a great idea though; I'll
bear this in mind for the future.

In case anyone's interested, the approach I took (for implementing a client
program that speaks the Styx protocol) was to create a client class that
implements a sendMessage() method.  When the client class connects to the
remote server, it fires off a background thread that continually listens for
received messages, firing an event when a whole message arrives.  A user can
send a message, then wait for the corresponding reply, or the user can send
a message and arrange for a callback method to be called when the reply
arrives.  (in Styx, a user can send several messages without waiting for
replies)  This allows both synchronous and asynchronous approaches and means
that I can use the client classes at the Python prompt, e.g:

from styx import *
conn = StyxConnection("aserver.com", 6666) # connect to the server
f = conn.open("afile", "r") # open a file for reading
f.read() # read the contents of the file

(In Styx, all remote resources are virtualised as files, so you interact
with a remote resource by reading from and writing to file-like objects.)

Thanks again,
Jon

Can you clarify here?  What paths are you referring to?  I'd prefer to
not duplicate those checks as well, but it seemed like the simplist
way to accomplish my goal.  It does sound like your understanding of
the code is better than mine though.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] TCP test harness
Message-ID: <1105469896.1250.25.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Has anyone written a TCP test harness in Twisted/Python? 
Someone has asked me to write one, but I'm fairly new to twisted (less
new to Python) and it seems that it would be silly for me to write
something if someone else has already written and/or posted one. 

Basically, I'm looking for a TCP test harness that will support up to a
thousand concurrent TCP connections at a time sending data to a remote
device. 

Thanks,

Braun Brelin

Sounds like a loop that calls reactor.connectTCP a bunch.  Do you need 
something more specific? Some more information might help.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] ProcessProtocol randomly not returning all of
	stdout
Message-ID: <94a776e70501131147496f4e2d@mail.gmail.com>

I recently started running into a problem where my process protocol
isn't extracting stdout accurately in all cases.  I have a method on a
service that loops through a list and runs a command, passing in each
item on the list one at a time.  Out of ~50 items in the list, and
thus ~50 invocations of the command, one or two will fail to extract
all of stdout from the command.  Instead the first character of stdout
is extracted and that is it.

The process protocol I'm using is below.  Does anyone see anything
wrong with the code?  I am using the win32event reactor and Twisted
1.3.0.


from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.internet import protocol, error, defer
from twisted.python import log

from ratcontrol import errors, config

import os, sys

class BasicProcessProtocol(protocol.ProcessProtocol):
    def __init__(self):
        self.deferred = defer.Deferred()
        self.stdout = ""
        self.stderr = ""
        self.status = 0

    def connectionMade(self):
        self.transport.closeStdin()

    def outReceived(self, data):
        self.stdout += data

    def errReceived(self, data):
        self.stderr += data

    def processEnded(self, reason):
        if reason.check(error.ProcessDone):
            self.status = 0
            # pass the items we want down the callback chain
            self.deferred.callback((self.status, self.stdout, self.stderr))
        else:
            self.status = 1
            theError = errors.CmdError(self.cmd, self.status,
self.stdout, self.stderr)
            log.msg(theError)
            self.deferred.errback(theError)

def openProcess(cmd_and_args):
        cmd = cmd_and_args[0]
        args = cmd_and_args[1:]

        # Spawn the process using the reactor so we don't block
        proto = BasicProcessProtocol()
        proto.cmd = cmd_and_args
        reactor.spawnProcess(proto, cmd, cmd_and_args, env=os.environ)
        return proto.deferred

The win32event process support is known to be buggy. On Windows, popen
with a thread may be a better choice.

Crud!  It's been working for me for most everything else.

Did you add support to the default reactor to spawn threads on
Windows?  I thought I saw a closed bug related to this, but was
waiting for the next release to try it out.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] "Directory triggers" with kqueue using Twisted?
	(on MacOS X / FreeBSD)
Message-ID: <jm9g11k2edf1.sh9smuf4bnrz.dlg@40tude.net>

Hello,

recently I read something about the "kqueue" event notification mechanism
built into FreeBSD and that it would allow to receive notification when
filesystem contents change. Would this mechanism allow to implement a
similar function as database triggers for a filesystem, i.e. write a script
that does something with files that are added to, modified in or deleted
from a certain directory without having to poll the filesystem all the
time? Folder actions allow such things on MacOS X, but Applescript is slow
and I would prefer Python anyway. ;-) If so, is there a way to write such
scripts in Python using Twisted?

TIA,

Best regards

Wolfgang Keller

Actually Folder Actions don't allow this.  I am relatively certain that 
they are implemented entirely in Finder.  They *might* be hooked into 
at the CoreServices/Carbon APIs, but DEFINITELY NOT the BSD level APIs 
(in Mac OS X 10.3 and earlier anyway).

The kernel in Mac OS X 10.3.0 supports kqueue, so you can use it for 
this sort of thing -- but Finder still polls.  I do not know what is 
necessary to integrate this with Twisted, though.  There is some 
support for kqueue in Twisted, but last I remember you need to download 
and patch some years-old extension and compile it in order to get that 
to work.

Another thing of interest to you might be FAM

Thread support has always been fine on Windows.

James was showing some docs that said it doesn't actually support the
file notification stuff currently.

Is this still true in trunk?  I keep thinking that we've fixed this
issue and it keeps not being fixed.  What issue number is it?

If popen with a thread is a better choice, can we provide an
implementation of that that comes with the reactor so that at least
people don't have to rewrite their code?

I've seen it used in GraphViz and ReSTedit, so that's simply not true 
(for files anyway, not sure about directories).

Cory checked in fixed code and then backed it out.

Cory's code may have been similar to doing this.

I was referring to Issue591, which based on the comments is done.  Can
anyone verify that?  Maybe I'll have to do a windows build instead of
wait for the next release.

Neato. Who wants to fix up kqreactor, and then write a cross-platform
file notification API that  uses kqueue when available?

I think Cory then backed the code out, so the bug ought to be reopened.

Dear All,

     I have doubt when I installed twisted web.
After the installation twisted web Whether we need any
other webserver or not to run web programs?
     I normally run all the server side coding(perl
scripts,php scripts) the following path.
"http://192.168.0.21/cgi-bin/helloworld.pl"  in
my machine. like that How I need to  run a perl
program in Twisted.
   I have confusion to give path details for mktap.
How I need to give path for mktap to run
like (http://192.168.0.21/cgi-bin/helloworld.pl).
   I already gone through lot of twisted
documentation.  But now I am in need of some
practical guidance from this list.

Save the above snippet to say www/perlsite.rpy and change the paths to 
be right for you.  Then run

 > mktap web --resource-script=www/perlsite.rpy
 > twistd -f ./web.tap

Never tried this myself, so .. hoping it works :)

good luck,

Andy.

Actually I'm playing with kqreactor right now, but before starting
serious work on it need to settle on new py-kqueue API first.

Results of first attempts to change kqreactor are very promising.
For example reactor's Waker implemented using kqueue's timer is much
simpler and way faster than FIFO ping-pong. Timers can be used for
CallLater as well...

Make sure kqueue uses a decent algorithm. Using glib timers for
callLater is *slower* than using Python for large numbers, since glib
uses a stupid O(n) algorithm.

Keep us posted on your work, it sounds very useful.

Yes, I'm in contact with David.

BTW If anyone uses PyKQueue I can send my WIP to test.

Message-ID: <200501182247.43920.sflist@ihonk.com>

Hi!

In the PB howto, it mentions that it's typical and fine to get bidirectional 
synchronization between objects by inheriting from both pb.Copyable and 
pb.RemoteCopy. Is the case the same when it comes to Cacheable?

I want a client to log in and grab attributes of objects as needed from the 
server, and any changes made to the objects on either side ought to be 
replicated on the other end. This looks like the way to accomplish that, but 
I want to verify my suspicion before Twisted bends my brain again. :-)

Thanks!

I've wondered about it too, and after thinking about it I decided it was
a bad idea.  In the copy case (which works fine) you get a one-time copy
through serialization when doing remote methods.  In the Cacheable case
though, objects get changed on the other side due to changes on the one
side.

So in practice, what does that mean when side A changes the same object
as side B ? What do you do with conflicting changes ? It seems to me you
have no predictable way of resolving clashing changes.  So I ended up
not wanting to deal with those situations and worked around my need for
this.

Now, I do think in practice it will probably work, just not reliably and
very hard to debug when it doesn't do what you expected.  Write a small
test app and give it a try.

Yeah, my intent is to protect simultaneous changes through a locking 
mechanism, which will prevent one client from altering a record while another 
client is working on it. (If that sounds like row-level locking to you, 
you're right.) Of course, network latencies may allow a conflict to 
occasionally occur, in which case the conflict should be detected by the 
server and it will do the arbitration to enforce integrity.

But, of course, all this only works nicely if inheriting from Cacheable and 
RemoteCache is fine and dandy.

I was afraid you'd suggest that. :-)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] succeedForOneOf
Message-ID: <94a776e70501200824229dfd62@mail.gmail.com>

I wrote succeedForOneOf to help when I want to loop through a list and
call a function with the item from the list as the first argument to
the function, and stop when one of the function calls succeeds.  The
use case I need it for is, connecting to multiple servers looking for
a particular thing, and stopping when I find it.

In my testing in the attached file, succeedForOneOf does what I would
expect.  However, when I tried this in my application, and func
involved connecting to servers via PB and calling a remote method, it
started up a ton of 'PBClientFactory's until the win32eventreactor
spun wildly out of control because I exceeded the 64 object
limitation.  This of course also caused the server I was connecting to
to spin wildly out of control as well, sucking up all of the CPU.

My question isn't related to the win32event reactor problem.  I just
don't understand why my implementation of succeedForOneOf would fail
in this manner.  Does anyone see a problem with the code?  Has someone
else written code to accomplish this in a different way?

Well the answer was terribly obvious.  I needed to cache my
connections and reuse them instead of making new connections all the
time.  I was confused by the fact that this worked previously in my
code, but it has evolved some since then.  Anyway, the attached code
works fine.

Message-ID: <1106322614.30599.11.camel@starbug.comcast.net>

I am in the process of building an interactive game server and client
with the client code written in Java and I have a couple of questions. I
am hoping to be up and running with a prototype in the next month. My
plans incluse the use of Twisted framework as I'm very comfortable in
Python as well as Java. 

My first question is, should I be looking at the new Twisted 2.0 for
development or stick with 1.3 and plan on upgrading to 2.0 later. 

Secondly, would using and/or building upon TwistedJava for the
communications between the Java clients and my Twisted server code be a
good direction to take?

They are compatible in the ways relevant to you, so I'd  start with 1.3.

Well... it works. But I'm not putting much effort into maintaining
TwistedJava these days. On the other hand if you find a serious bug I
will fix it.

How complex and varied is the data you will be sending back and forth?

Hi Bill (and everyone),

You might be interested to know that there's a Java package called Netty
(http://gleamynode.net/dev/projects/netty2/) that is very similar in
principle to Twisted, in that it allows you to write network clients and
servers in an efficient, event-based way.  I'm using it and have found it
very good - pretty simple to use and has been very reliable for me so far.
The scope of Netty isn't as large as Twisted, but the core of it is very
similar.

You might also like to read this paragraph on the future of Netty before you
start: http://gleamynode.net/dev/forum/viewtopic.php?t=87.

Regards, Jon

Hi everyone,

is there a way to use Zope as a client to Twisted PB ?
Background is that I have a nicely working application using Twisted. The GUI 
client is wxPython based and talks to the server part using PB.
Now I'd like to add a webinterface that would ideally use PB to to talk to my 
application server part and retrieve some of the information. 
Is that possible at all? Any pointers?

Thanks

The data is composed of interactive text streams, Java types/classes
(representing mouse movements, etc) and binary data (jpg/png type data).
I can convert the  data to a "neutral" format (such as xdr) and build
communication data structures to encapsulate it if needed but if the
TwistedJava code does this already I'm that much further ahead. Keeping
the data streams in a Java native format "seems" like a good way to go
but the Python code will need to use the data as well and I'm not that
far along with what the difference between a Java String and Python
String (repeat this for each Java native type) are.

TwistedJava will do the expected conversion by default (so e.g. String
to unicode string in python, ArrayList to list, Integer from/to python
int, etc..). It's lossy going from Python to Java though (can't make
Java ints, only Integers with the default objects,), so you'll need to
write some custom code to create java arrays, but not too much.

PB + zope is messy, you would need to run a reactor in a zope thread.

A zope uri is a valid xml-rpc object whos methods are callable using
xml-rpc + basic auth. twisteds xml-rpc client support lacks basic auth
even though the underlying xml-rpc library supports it. We patched it
up at work but our patch was pretty hacky and not implemented at the
layer that it should be to merge into twisted. 

I guess you could:

a) only invoke methods without security properties set on them in zope
b) fix up twisteds xml-rpc client to do basic auth well
c) ask me for the patch we use and see if its helpful (I doubt it) 

I like the sound of b :)

Ok, good. I'll do some playing around with it this weekend using our
Java client prototype. 

Thanks for the help, I'll let you know how it progresses.

Message-ID: <20050122154808.37314.qmail@web54310.mail.yahoo.com>

I am fairly experienced with Python (I also use wxPython a lot), and I have a fair amount of
experience with TCP/IP in terms of mechanics and troubleshooting.  I have almost no experience in
network programming.

I am working on a computer graphics application (Python/C++ hybrid) which demands a lot of CPU
time.  I am in the planning stages of converting it to distribute the work over many computers on
the same local network (although I would eventually like to expand that as well).

There will be a main computer which checks to see who is available to participate.  That main
computer will also be helping with the processing load.  After that, it is basically all computers
sending out either requests for information or sending data in response to a request (data can
also be sent unsolicited).

So I guess my question is--is Twisted more than what I need?  I am sure it will do the job.  I
have read quite a bit of material on the web site already.  But would it be faster and easier to
just code this by hand or to use some other network programming framework/development tool?

Thanks!!!
Todd

Of course it is, and all for the better. At the same time, it's
*exactly* what you need. :-)

And you are probably right.

It most probably wouldn't, since you state not having much experience in
network programming.

None there I know of, in the Python world, and maybe elsewhere too.
Perspective Broker alone is a dream come true, for distributed applications.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0501231042170.29938-100000@naskur.se.linux.org>

I'm thinking about implementing an application that can browse
filesystems (through ssh,ftp etc), databases, snmp mibs, zip/tar/gz
files, a little toolbox where you can do all kinds of stuff with an mc
like interface. Did anyone implement this already?

I've checked the examples on the twistedmatrix site and all protocols
like ssh, ftp, imap seem to have their own interface. IMHO, a common
interface for browsing would be nice, something like VFS (e.g. Gnome
VFS). With Gnome VFS you have the same interface for webdav, ftp, gzip,
cdda and others.

Also, IMHO, simpleftpclient.py and simplesshclient.py should differ only
one or very few lines, the authentication part. Everything else should
be the same.

Am I making sense? What do you think about this?

You're saying that VFS is a good idea and that I should implement it?
As I'm no twisted guru I'd like some guidance, please. Has this been
thought about before? Is something like this considered for 2.0? Are
there any difficulties implementing it?

At some stage this year I'll be implementing a related thing for work,
most probably given back to twisted; A twisted VFS server, the concept
will be to provide a simple tree that represents a filesystem, which
will then be published via webDAV (which we will implement for twisted),
FTP, sambaVFS etc.. I guess this is the opposite of what your takling
about, your interested in a client to other existing services.

The reason I bring this up is that they seem like two halves of the same
project.

Hmmm ... are you saying there's a webdav-package coming in a
soon-to-be-released update of the Twisted-package? Based on akadav or
something else?

WabDav is probably the only thing I miss in Twisted. Well, that and
perhaps better ( if it works at all ) support for ICQ.

BTW: Any hint on how to communicate to ICQ-users would be highly interesting.

Best regards,
Thomas

no I'm saying that at 'some stage this year' I'll be doing this stuff
for work, The plan was to implement webdav on top of twisted.web2 when
it settled down, but if akaDAV does webDAV for twisted already we will
just use that :) (I hadn't heard of akaDAV till today, and our focus is
VFS not DAV so YAY for whoever wrote this for me)

also, I'm not a twisted hacker so I cant say what will/will not be
bundled with the twisted package.

Only one hint for you, please make sure to run all fs calls with a
thread pool, and never do a vfs call that doesn't support poll(2) within
the main twisted thread. All I/O calls are synchronous and they block
the main thread completely. Best would be to support kernel
asynchronous I/O natively in the reactor, but that depends on linux at
least, so having a posix threaded abstraction for aio would be ok even
if lower performant than kernel aio (note that the kernel is going to
use threads too for aio, the only advantage is that they're kernel
threads instead of user threads, so with multiple apps and not only
twisted running, they can save some tlb flush, plus there is some other
advantage, but having threaded aio inside twisted without kernel support
would be already pretty good).

I'm working on this, but as an aside from web2, which is an aside from 
work, so not very quickly. :)

This this is a good thing you guys are doing. The windows installs have all worked fine for me, however im having trouble with mandrake linux.

My problem:
I trying to instal on Mandrake linux 10 (run all patches) and for some reason my Python 2.3 directory does not have the config/makefile in it, could I just copy this from somewhere?

You need to install the Python2.3 devel package for mandrake. IIRC,
it's called python2.3-devel, or something along those lines. :-)

Why don't you just use the Mandrake package for twisted ? It's in the
"contrib" repository.
If you don't know how to configure an external repository, see

Take your time. I first looked into that, but then when I started using

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Importing twisted.names.client blocks
Message-ID: <41F65EDC.3040106@brainbot.com>

Hi,

I started testing a program today which imported twisted.names.client. 
On every second run, the program didn't return from the import and hung 
for some time (until I pressed some key, strange...). Turns out, that I 
don't have Crypto installed and twisted.protocol.dns then tries to read 
2 bytes from
/dev/random, /dev/srandom, and /dev/urandom (in that order, until first 
success) in order to determine a random source. If it succeeds with one 
of those devices, it will also use that method later to read a random 
integer.
The man page for urandom (on linux+fbsd) tells me that /dev/random is 
for 'uses that  need  very  high quality randomness such as one-time pad 
or key generation' and that reads to /dev/random will block when the 
entropy  pool  is  empty.
In contrast /dev/urandom will not block, but it's output may be analyzed 
by an attacker ('Knowledge  of  how  to  do this is not available in the 
current non-classified liter­ature'...but then that linux man page is 
very old...).
I suggest that the usage of /dev/random should be stopped. If it doesn't 
bite you on import, it will do so later, when you're doing lots of dns 
request (a coworker of mine had written http crawler and told me, that 
it started getting slower after 3 hours or so, guess that was the time 
when /dev/random ran out of entropy). After all, when none of those 
devices is available, the code will also fallback to using random.randint.

Twisted is pretty hard to ramp up on.  I wonder if  twisted discussions 
and howtos were discussed in a wiki if twisted could become more 
documented and palatable to the masses?

Message-ID: <41F669B1.7060107@alumni.uvic.ca>

Any thoughts on serving compressed HTTP.  I didn't see anything in 
twisted to do this out of the box.  Do I need to create a new reactor?  
Here are some use cases:

if a user-agent accepts compressed data

- compress static content
- compress static content, caching the result somewhere
- return compressed "memory" data.
- return compressed dynamic data

- return compressed dynamic data only when certain mime types are supplied.

I'm pretty sure there's a  bug open for this in
http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/ and if not make sure to open one so this
gets fixed.

Thanks in advance.

Web questions should be asked on the twisted-web mailing list. A couple
of people have implemented this already, I think (possibly gzstream at
http://undefined.org/python/ is one). The twisted-web list should be
able to point you at any.

Don't bother with it, it's useless, I wasn't thinking when I added it.

You can have code that runs everytime an exception is logged:

twisted.python.log.addObserver(f)

f(aDict) will be called for every logged message, including
exceptions/failures. Just make sure f() doesn't raise exceptions itself
or it will get removed.

If you have code that crashes the *reactor*, i.e. twisted quits, that's
a bug in twisted and you should add a report ot
http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/.

when I say that crashes the *reactor* i mean that the

others clients later are unhable to connect (in the
server dos-box continuosly showing a traceback)

If you are running on Windows and your DOS prompt is filling up with
tracebacks, it is probably the 64 object limitation with the
win32event reactor.  I do my best to avoid that problem by only
allowing a certain number of tasks to happen at the same time, using a
semaphore.  You can try another reactor if you don't need to call
spawnProcess (see http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/issue591).

Hi,

In this source (part of the tutorial at

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/howto/listings/pb/copy_receiver.py

When you run it, it does nothing and exits. Could somebody let me know what

Thanks,

The consensus in the past has been that a wiki wouldn't help much.  Search
the archives for details.

We're keen to help make the documentation better -- please feel free to file
bugs at http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs, and set the topic to "documentation".
If you want to draft changes or new docs, you can also file those there.

Also, the latest howtos and examples built from SVN head can be found here:
    http://twistedmatrix.com/users/warner/doc-latest

But if you get stuck -- please, ask.  This mailing list and the IRC channel
are happy to help answer your questions.  Eventually we get tired of
answering some questions over and over, and we turn those into proper
documentation ;)

-Andrew.

This example is misnamed -- it should be copy_receiver.tac.  "tac" stands
for "Twisted Application Configuration", and is run with "twistd -y".
twistd doesn't actually care what the file's extension is, so you can run it
with:

    twistd -noy copy_receiver.py

(see the twistd(1) man page and the twisted.application howto:
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/howto/application)

I'll fix the docs to make this clearer.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Problem with ClientFactory
Message-ID: <200501261657.14178@tintia.doriath>

Hi,

I've been writing a small client program connecting to the server through 
SSL when occurred a strange problem. At the beginning I thought that it was 
my fault, I changed my mind after examining examples (exactly 
echoclient_ssl.py) shipped with the Twisted distribution, though. After 
many try-and-fails I think I found the problematic code. I created this 
test case to show the issue:
#v+
from OpenSSL import SSL
from twisted.internet.protocol import ClientFactory
from twisted.protocols.basic import LineOnlyReceiver

class Protocol(LineOnlyReceiver):
    def connectionMade(self):
        self.sendLine("GET / HTTP/1.0\n")

    def lineReceived(self, line):
        print line

class Factory(ClientFactory):
    protocol = Protocol
    def startedConnecting(self, connector):
        print "Connecting..."

    def buildProtocol(self, addr):
        print "Connected."

    def clientConnectionLost(self, connector, reason):
        print "Connection Lost."
        reactor.stop()

    def clientConnectionFailed(self, connector, reason):
        print "Connection Failed."
        reactor.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    host = "sf.net"
    port = 443
    from twisted.internet import reactor, ssl
    reactor.connectSSL(host, port, Factory(), ssl.ClientContextFactory())
    reactor.run()
#v-

After running this code I get "Connecting, Connected" lines and long 
tracebacks warning about two exceptions (I could attach it, if it was 
useful).

$ rpm -q python-Twisted python-pyOpenSSL; uname -o
python-Twisted-1.3.0-7
python-pyOpenSSL-0.6-2
PLD Linux

The most interesting (funny?) thing with this problem is the simplest 
workaround - after removing startedConnecting and buildProtocol methods of 
Factory class everything works fine, I get the response from the server and 
requested page. Is that meant to (not)work that way? If so, please write it 
somewhere in the HOWTO using big letters, otherwise let somebody fix 
it. ;-)

P.S. HTTPS is just an example. I know about dedicated software for that 
purpose, but it's useless for me. ;-) I'm just wondering about the cause of 
this problem.

Yes, 2.0 is going to have separate downloads for separate packages
(along with a one-in-all download, of course), so the distutils code is
currently work in progress.

The problem is you overrode buildProtocol. Default buildProtocol returns
self.protocol(), but if you override it you need to create and return a
protocol instance yourself.

Hello, there's a dramatic slowdown in the number of calls per second in 
the pbbenchclient.py /  pbbenchserver.py programs 
(http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/examples/) if I just change 
the number of deferred calls from two to three, and make the connection 
between two different computers.  With the stock program, I get around 
900 cps, with the modified one, I get around 5 cps.  I'm a newbie, so 
maybe something is going on that I'm not understanding.  Anyway, here 
are the pseudo-diffs in pbbenchclient.py:

<< hostname = 'localhost'
 >> hostname = '192.168.0.2'

and

<< d1 = self.persp.callRemote("simple")
<< d2 = self.persp.callRemote("complexTypes")
<< defer.DeferredList(l).addCallback(self.callLoop)

 >> l=[self.persp.callRemote("simple") for x in range(3)]
 >> defer.DeferredList(l).addCallback(self.callLoop)

The slowdown only appears between two different computers.  If I run it 
on a single computer I get 700 cps.  If I run it between two separate 
computers but with one or two simultaneous deferreds, then there's only 
a very minor slowdown.  I'm running on windows 2000 with 
Twisted-1.3.0.win32-py2.3.exe. 

What do you think?  Is this a strange behaviour of twisted or is there 
something screwed up with my networking?

Cheers, -Russ

Thanks, Andrew, it's been too long since I've read the tac docs. I appreciate

It is possible this is due to the immediate-write behavior of twisted 
1.3 combined with the TCP Nagle algorithm. You could try calling 
transport.setTcpNoDelay(True) on both ends (the client and the server 
end) to see if that helps.

Indeed. I should have checked the sources first. Anyway, thanks for info.

Unfortunately, just after fixing above problem, I occurred one really 
annoying "feature". When I try to connect to a host/port which doesn't 
support SSL connections, I receive an exception which I can't catch. The 
traceback looks like this:
#v+
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/twisted/python/context.py", line 
43, in callWithContext
  File "/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/twisted/internet/default.py", line

in writeSomeData
OpenSSL.SSL.Error: [('SSL routines', 'SSL3_GET_RECORD', 'wrong version

#v-

Is it possible to catch it? I put a try...except statement near the reactor 
calls, but it didn't work. I was trying to find somewhere else an answer to 
my question, however I failed after a couple of hours of searching.

I'm not saying it's a big problem, but it "doesn't look nice" and a good 
program shouldn't behave in this way.

Ok, now I'm feeling quite clueless.  I guessed that "transport" refers 
to myPBClientFactory.protocol.transport (for the client case).  But this 
is set to None and never changes.  Where is the underlying transport 
stored in PBClientFactory and PBServerFactory?

   From: stage3 at us.ibm.com (Garrett Rolfs)

   I fear I'm missing something basic and overlooked something already
   documented.  Hopefully someone will set me straight.  I'm attempting
   to play with MoinMoin using twisted as the webserver.  I'm running on
   linux using python 2.3.4 and twisted 1.3.0 as a nonroot user.  When I
   attempt to start MoinMoin, I see the following in the log:

I am seeing the same problem with an online tutorial system being
developed here at MIT.  The problem is directly related to the use of
AFS, which adds two high-numbered groups to the user's list, as
reported by "id -G".  If I authenticate using standard passwords,
those groups aren't present and Twisted starts fine.

This is an urgent problem for us.  Next week, we will start teaching a
class that uses this system.  Since AFS is in widespread use here at
MIT, the students will be using AFS for their home directories.

I'd like to get this fixed, either by some kind of patch, or by a
workaround.  Does anyone on the list have any ideas about this?

The only thing I can think of doing is to change initgroups to filter
out the bad groups.

Thanks,
Chris

The right fix is to never try to change or verify the groups list when 
not instructed to change userids. Currently twistd defaults its uid/gid 
arguments to the current user's UID/GID, and attempts to 
setuid/setgid/initialize groups appropriately, which is silly. See also 
http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/issue600.

A quick fix is to comment out twisted/scripts/twistd.py:160:     
shedPrivileges(config['euid'], process.uid, process.gid)
which is useless when not running as root.

Can we get in a long term fix for 2.0?

That would be great.  It turns out my problem is/was the same as the
folks at MIT.  My linux box is an AFS client.  A person in my
department that is our resident AFS expert informed me that AFS uses
the first 2 group slots to store the AFS PAG (Process Authentication
Group) identifier for the user.  This is for 2.4 and older kernels.  I
don't know if it is the same for 2.6 kernels.  I know the OpenAFS
folks are in the process of redoing PAGs because of 2.6 kernel
changes.

For now.  Commenting out the the call to shedPrivileges works for me.

Message-ID: <20050129144339.GC10440@opteron.random>

While I appreciate the tweaking of the tap file for production usage,
during development it's more handy to use a tac file and avoid the
pickling that otherwise would happen too frequently for every test.

By adding these lines at the end of the tap.py file I can run both tac
and tap from the same file by using tap.py instead like if it was a tac
file (started with twistd -noy)

It wasn't obvious immediatly that it was possible.

I only had to add these lines at the end of tap.py (tap.py like in
finger example of the howto):

s = web.make_service(Options())
from twisted.application import service
application = service.Application('cpushare_web')
s.setServiceParent(service.IServiceCollection(application))

This takes all option defaults just fine (like if mktap was run without
tweaking parameters). I believe a cut and paste shoud work for most tap
files if they follow the same naming of the Options class.

I didn't see this trick mentioned in the docs, so JFYI.

Personally I feel mktap should not be used until we come up with a
better runtime configuration system. TACs seem like the best deployment
method, for now.

Hey folks,

There are some loose plans floating around for a Twisted Sprint in

Date: Likely to be three days, including a Saturday and Sunday, in
either late March or early April 2005.

Location: Hobart, Australia.

If you're even vaguely likely to be able to attend such a thing, can you
reply to me off-list and let me know. Include a preference for a
particular weekend during that time if you have any.

I heard that, but I didn't want to reinvent the wheel on the -u/-g and
Options() parameters that are already handled by mktap.

For deployment taps seems ok too since the slow pickling happens only
once in a while. OTOH for testing I use the defaults of Options and I
don't use -u/-g (I run on ports >1024 with the Options() defaults), so I
can avoid the pickling during testing.

So doing both tac and tap in the same file seems a quite handy solution
for me. I mentioned it just because the howto didn't mention it but in
practice it's what I find more handy to use ;).

It's possible to set uid and gid in TACs. Just needs better
documentation. Also arguably those options ought to be twistd, not
mktap/tacs :/

This is exactly the point, they ought to be twistd. I know I can set uid
and gid as parameter to the application, but I'd need to change
sourcecode to do that, the point of reconfiguring is to avoid changing
sourcecode.

The Options() are the same problem. I don't want to reinvent a
configuration method when the Options with mktap already exists.

So even all Options() I can give to mktap should be available through
twistd the same way -u/-g should be available to twistd.

It probably can be implemented in a backwards compatible fascion, and I
probably won't have to change a single bit on my app, after those
Options() are moved from mktap to twistd. The Options API already exists
for mktap, we've only to extend it to the tac file too.

Anyway as said for now the mktap is ok for deployment where recreating
the tap file happens not frequently at all, but I'd also prefer to avoid
the pickling since I'm not getting any advantage from the tap file at
all and it only wastes some cpu.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <60ed19d405013100485d671ba@mail.gmail.com>

I've thrown together some tarballs with my latest release automation
code. You can download them here:

http://twistedmatrix.com/users/radix/2.0/

Please download the packages relevant to you and give them a test.
You'll need to install Twisted-2.0.0a1 before any of the other
subproject packages in there, and it depends on zope.interface being
installed, which I haven't bothered including yet.

If anybody's interested in making packages for their OS, now's the
time to start working on it.

Thanks!

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Support for updates in twisted.names
Message-ID: <6C5F0F3099DC5B45B87D78EE2A37830D1AC8DC@ukhkm001.edsadewd.edl.uk.eds.com>

I'm using twisted.names (DNS server) but have a need to do updates (see
nsupdate).

I've already done some work on this (which I plan to submit in due course),
but wondered:

a) Is anyone else working on updates (wouldn't want to duplicate efforts)?

b) Is there some fundamental reason why I shouldn't do this?


Jeff.

As part of releasing Twisted 2.0, we'll probably want to do another
press release and add some more success stories to the website. We would
love to have success stories, quotes, and so on from companies and
individuals using Twisted. Email me, or the list if you want.

Hey Mary,

Just making a vague expression of interest.  I'm up in cairns atm but it 
  would a great thing to get involved with.  What level of twisted 
competence do you think will be required?

No preference for dates.

thanks,
Andy.

I'll answer on-list: I don't really have a good sense of how much
Twisted competance you'd need. What the sprint would be hacking on
hasn't been at all finalised. My feeling is probably that Python
competance would be enough and the sprint itself could teach you the
relevant bits of Twisted for whatever the topic was.

Alternatively, you could show up with your own project and benefit it by
picking people's brains a bit.
