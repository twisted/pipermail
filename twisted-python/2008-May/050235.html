</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What worries me is the size of a single Deferred. One user wanted to

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I tried to measure the size of a Deferred by creating large lists of

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Adding a callback brings that up to about 500 bytes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As such thing as memory allocation is tightly tied to the runtime
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> environment, it is a bit hard to give reasonable answers without any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information about, at least, an OS and a CPU.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, sorry: I tested this on an Athlon 64 X2 (but with 32-bit Debian). I
</I>&gt;<i> simply tested like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> % python
</I>&gt;<i> Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Apr 17 2008, 13:15:05) 
</I>&gt;<i> [GCC 4.2.3 (Debian 4.2.3-3)] on linux2
</I>&gt;<i> Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from twisted.internet.defer import Deferred
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a = [Deferred() for _ in xrange(100000)]
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> b = [Deferred() for _ in xrange(100000)]
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> c = [Deferred() for _ in xrange(100000)]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and noted how the memory usage rose from 8 MiB to 30 MiB, to 52 MiB to
</I>&gt;<i> 73 MiB in 'top'. So that is about 22 MiB per list -- around ~200 bytes
</I>&gt;<i> pr Deferred. (I know there is some overhead for the list.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Did the memory in the case you mention grow constantly? Is that user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure, that it was not a memory leak in his/hers code?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think he was just concerned that his application used 450 MiB RAM, and
</I>&gt;<i> that made me try to see how big an empty Deferred is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Deferreds, as you all already know, are a core concept that Twisted is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> built upon. If you need to optimize such areas of Twisted, then, just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my suggestion - maybe you are using a wrong tool to do the job. If the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory usage is a problem, then, well, maybe you are trying to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things at once, when you should do them sequentially (eg. using a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generator).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, you may be right... scheduling everything to run at once is
</I>&gt;<i> probably not necessary. It just makes things simple with my design.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would love to get some advice on the design of my library -- it is the
</I>&gt;<i> first thing I have made with Twisted. The goal of VIFF is to enable
</I>&gt;<i> shared computations -- think addition and multiplication. So the user writes
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   x = add(a, mul(b * c))
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and where a, b, c are Deferreds which will eventually hold integers. The
</I>&gt;<i> add and mul functions return new Deferreds which will eventually hold
</I>&gt;<i> the results. Addition is simple:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   def add(x, y):
</I>&gt;<i>       sum = gatherResults([x, y])
</I>&gt;<i>       sum.addCallback(lambda results: results[0] + results[1])
</I>&gt;<i>       return sum
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Multiplication is similar, but requires network communication -- that is
</I>&gt;<i> why it returns a Deferred.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is the basic operation of the library: an expression tree is built
</I>&gt;<i> and evaluated from the leaves inwards. The important point is that as
</I>&gt;<i> much as possible is done in parallel, that all operations run as soon as
</I>&gt;<i> their operands are available. Twisted made this extremely easy thanks to
</I>&gt;<i> the DeferredList and Deferred abstraction.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe you should rather look into other areas of the problem (eg. not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> try to optimize deferreds, but the code that uses them). Maybe you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should use something else than Deferreds for that job. As for memory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usage of such small objects like Deferreds, well... Python is, well,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Python. Python string or integer uses much more memory, than C string
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or int. You can't tune Python string memory usage, and you hardly can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do anything about size of Deferred if that becomes a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is the possibility of using the __slots__ attribute to avoid the
</I>&gt;<i> object dictionary. I don't know what negative sideeffects that might
</I>&gt;<i> have, though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I have yet to try the C implementation of Deferred to see how it
</I>&gt;<i> performs memory-wise.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the other hand, you should be able to write optimal code with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Python faster and memory footprint shouldn't be a problem (from my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experience, in many cases Twisted footprint is suprisingly low).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In other words - if size of Deferred object is your only bottleneck,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then congratulations :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hehe, thanks! :-) I am certainly not claiming that Deferreds are the
</I>&gt;<i> only bottleneck or consumer of memory. I just figured that they would be
</I>&gt;<i> an easy starting point since my code (and as you say, Twisted in
</I>&gt;<i> general) uses them a lot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd rather suggest optimizing other parts of the code - as Deferreds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are the core of Twisted, I suppose it could be a bit hard to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything about them, in the same way you can't do anything about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory footprint of core Python objects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right... I'll try looking through the code to see if I by mistake hold
</I>&gt;<i> on to Deferreds or other objects longer than I have to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Surely (he said, tongue firmly in cheek) the answer to having too many 
outstanding Deferreds is to use faster peer systems :-)
