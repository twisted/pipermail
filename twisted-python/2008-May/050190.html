Yep, that helps, Jean-Paul, thanks for the info. I've been chaining
deferreds for years, but I never thought there was a limit to how many
times I could do it, and even if I had, I'd have never expected the
number would be so low. I looked in the docs and found no mention of it.

&gt;<i> It may be possible to replace this recursion with iteration, but I'm not

</I>﻿
I disagree that this would be a problem. If I'm chaining 10,000
deferreds, I'm taking responsibility to handle a blow-up of that
magnitude. That's why my original example involved putting 5 deferreds
at a time into a DeferredList -- in my real code I'm checking the
results from that DeferredList and stopping sanely if there's an issue.

Deferred's got too much mojo for me to consider submitting a patch, but
I hope somebody does, since there's no conceptual reason why there
should be such a limit.

/me wanders off to Trac to submit a ticket...

Steve
