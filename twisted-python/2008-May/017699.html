<PRE>Hi Valentino,

Thank you very much for the thoughtful response.
I was familiar with the fact that you have some hands on
experience with SQLAlchemy and Twisted, so it's good
to hear true stories from the trenches.

A while back I came upon a talk you did at Europython,
and it had some discussion of Twisted and SQLAlchemy,
with, to be quite honest, some very 'magical' looking code:
<A HREF="http://files.10noodles.com/stiq_at_europython07.pdf">http://files.10noodles.com/stiq_at_europython07.pdf</A>

Anyways, it's really looking like the answer to
&quot;how do you combine Twisted and SQLAlchemy&quot;
comes down to: &quot;run it in another process&quot;.

I guess the canonical solution to dealing with all
inherently blocking API's with respect to twisted is
run them in separate process, which sounds just fine.

-Alex

</I>&gt;<i>  I've long worked on trying to integrate sqlalchemy and twisted in a

</I>&gt;<i>  are countless reasons behind this limitation, like the fact that
</I>&gt;<i>  sqlalchemy objects can do a lot of stuff behind the scenes or because

</I>&gt;<i>  and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone to use the orm together within
</I>&gt;<i>  a Twisted process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  What I ended up doing is creating subprocesses that have fairly
</I>&gt;<i>  complex logic and usually spend more than a few seconds doing their
</I>&gt;<i>  job. By doing this I simply use sqlalchemy synchronously and without
</I>&gt;<i>  any problems (I was starting to go completely crazy while trying to
</I>&gt;<i>  debug time-dependent errors when I decided to refactor my code to use
</I>&gt;<i>  subprocesses instead, everything started working smoothly without any
</I>&gt;<i>  relevant change in the logic or in the test code and now I can also
</I>&gt;<i>  run the subprocess as a system script to check and verify stuff or
</I>&gt;<i>  debug (with pdb)).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Considering that an ORM is only useful (?) for very complex logic I
</I>&gt;<i>  consider my approach completely sane. Use the query generator for
</I>&gt;<i>  everything and reserve the orm for long running tasks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  nadbapi and storm-twisted tries to solve the orm problem in a similar
</I>&gt;<i>  way but nadbapi is no longer maintained, anyway both currently suffer
</I>&gt;<i>  from an incredible number of deferreds that they generate making the
</I>&gt;<i>  use of defgen an absolute requirement (and thus lowering overall
</I>&gt;<i>  performance). If you look hard enough in glyph's old blog or in this
</I>&gt;<i>  list (I can't remember where exactly) you can find a post about
</I>&gt;<i>  letting the database deal with concurrency and not spread it in
</I>&gt;<i>  application code (aka having tons of deferreds). It is true that not
</I>&gt;<i>  using threads increases speed and memory usage but for this particular
</I>&gt;<i>  case 99% of the time you are not going to need neither of them anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  closing: I recently refactored some code that used sqlalchemy orm into
</I>&gt;<i>  using just the query generator and instead of taking 17 seconds it now
</I>&gt;<i>  takes 7 seconds and memory usage has decreased considerably. It's not
</I>&gt;<i>  really just because an orm is slower than simply executing queries,
</I>&gt;<i>  but rather because querying the db was so easy; it was basically done
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;recklessly&quot; without thinking too much about the performance hit of
</I>&gt;<i>  going back and forth to the database. This is basically why I'd rather
</I>&gt;<i>  not use ORMs unless forced by legacy code or because generating a
</I>&gt;<i>  query would introduce so much complexity to make it an application in
</I>&gt;<i>  itself (very rare case IMHO).
