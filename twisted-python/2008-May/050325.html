I had almost the same experience. When Steve Holden first let me know
that this discussion was happening, I was like &quot;ah, shit.&quot; But then,
when Glyph talked to me about it, he talked me down. As Phil said,
this is the only recourse if we want to have the ability to legally
protect *our* (the community's) investment in Twisted.

The thing is, this thread got derailed early on, and there is another
really important point here that Glyph pointed out to me. Trademark
issues aside, we want to provide a mechanism (for starters, a naming
convention) by which *more* community members can participate without
having to under go the arduous (for a beginner) review process, code
scrutiny, etc. In the same way that naming a project &quot;pySomething&quot; is
not only an indication of its programming language, but (even more?)
that it is a resource of the Python community, naming a project
&lt;twisted prefix&gt;Something will do the same for coders who are creating
Twisted &quot;community resources.&quot;
