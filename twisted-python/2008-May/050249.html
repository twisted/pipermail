</I>
Okay, thanks for looking at it!

&gt;&gt;<i> The important point is that as much as possible is done in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parallel, that all operations run as soon as their operands are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available. Twisted made this extremely easy thanks to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DeferredList and Deferred abstraction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the point where I think, that you answered your question. If
</I>&gt;<i> you do stuff in parallel, you use more Deferreds and more memory.
</I>
Yes, I guess you are right... :-) The design tries to do everything at
once with as much parallism as possible. But since bandwidth is
limited, I guess I could achieve the same throughput by scheduling
things in a slower rate. Maybe using something like this:

  class map_parallel(Deferred):
      def __init__(self, iterable, func, max):
          Deferred.__init__(self)
  
          self.iter = iterable
          self.func = func
          self.running = 0
  
          for _ in range(max):
              self.running += 1
              self.run_next(None)
  
      def run_next(self, arg):
          try:
              e = self.iter.next()
              e.addCallback(self.func)
              e.addCallback(self.run_next)
          except StopIteration:
              # The iterator is exhausted.
              self.running -= 1
              if self.running == 0 and not self.called:
                  # All callbacks have finished.
                  self.callback(None)
          # Pass the argument through unchanged.
          return arg

where map_parallel will map a function over a list of Deferreds, but
it will only run up to max function applications in parallel. I will
experiment with it, and if it works well, then it would be cool to
have a class like this in Twisted.

&gt;<i> I will repeat myself now: I would rather try to find other places to
</I>&gt;<i> optimize VIFF, than reducing memory footprint of Deferred. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> have a CS degree, I'm not a mathematician, but from what you wrote
</I>&gt;<i> it seems that maybe it would be worth to try implementing something
</I>&gt;<i> stack-based (like RPN), than the tree approach you seem to be doing
</I>&gt;<i> now - of course if having a stack is something you can have using
</I>&gt;<i> secure multiparty calculations.
</I>
Thanks for the ideas! You could certainly do what you suggest,
changing the schedule like that is okay from a security point of view.
And if I can delay allocating memory until needed by doing so, then it
will definitely be interesting to try.
