I have a similar predilection against trademarking, but when I really  
think about it, I only feel this way because of the actions of those  
who abuse the intent of trademark law. However, it's clear that  
legally, if Twisted wants any ability to protect against blatant  
misuse of the name, this is the only recourse.

The problem is that there's no clear policy on trademarking for OSS  
projects. If Twisted were to approach its trademark policy in a way  
similar to the MIT license, I think I would be okay with it. E.g., no  
license fees, pragmatic enforcement, etc.

A good example of what I wouldn't want to see is the whole Firefox/ 
Iceweasel debacle.

I have to say, personally, there's pretty much no way I would ever  
name a project 'Twisty' anything ;-).

Of course, I understand this wouldn't be a requirement, but if this is  
to be a useful marketing technique, whatever the prefix is needs to be  
obvious, but also inconsequential. That's the thing that's great about  
the Java convention, once you're familiar with it, you pretty much  
stop seeing the J. Same with the tired but successful iSomething.

I think a one- or two-letter prefix is pretty much the best option

</I>

When choosing which prefix to use, I would suggest against being too  
concerned with which obscure software project already uses it.  
ToscaWidgets is still in alpha according to their webpage, which  
hasn't been updated in ages. I don't mean to deride another project,  
but considering the high rate of failure of most OSS projects, unless  
it has a community inertia as large as or larger than Twisted's, I say  
every project for itself.

Still, though, as far as I can tell, there's no projects using a T  
prefix. I kind of like the idea of tStorage and tSNMP, to use the  
recent examples.

I am curious, though, what would Divmod do? You guys have some of the  
most significant Twisted projects, and would probably be the best  
people to set the example, but you already have great names for your  
projects. tMantissa or twdAxiom just don't seem very stylin' ;-)...
