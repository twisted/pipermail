</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The daemon listens for connections from different peers. Some peers
</I>&gt;<i>  just leave a message and disconnect, some peers connect as receivers
</I>&gt;<i>  and linger waiting for messages. A message will be given to the daemon

</I>&gt;<i>  connected receivers. The daemon keeps a data structure (a dict with
</I>&gt;<i>  identifier: channel, actually) of receivers which it cycles through in
</I>&gt;<i>  a round-robin fashion.
</I>
One common strategy in twisted is to keep a list of your connected
clients (Protocol instances) as part of  the factory.  See:

<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/servers.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/servers.html</A>

So in the dataReceived method on you Protocol, you would do something like:

def dataReceived(self):
    self.factory.clients.append(self)

&gt;<i>  There are more scenarios as well; (recievers may send status messages
</I>&gt;<i>  back to the daemon that the daemon logs, some messengers linger
</I>&gt;<i>  waiting for confirmation from a receiver and a few other) but they arees,
</I>&gt;<i>  mostly just variations of the above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I'm a bit confused about what parts should be in the Protocol and what
</I>&gt;<i>  should be separated away from it. Should I make a specialized Factory
</I>&gt;<i>  or make a Service (or several depending on what type of client
</I>&gt;<i>  connection it is)?
</I>
I think generally it is a good idea to have a specialized Factory as
this binds global state for you Protocol instances.  The server howto
linked above describes this pattern quite well.

&gt;<i>  I realize there is a lot in my description that's open for
</I>&gt;<i>  interpretation, but since I'm mostly after design ideas and good
</I>&gt;<i>  practices, I'm hoping that's OK..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The finger tutorial does a good job of explaining many aspects of
twisted, and this might give you some ideas of how to leverage its
parts for your application:
