I think you're right and that changing that line to use ceil() is a good 
fix. It does mean that some timeouts might happen up to a millisecond 
later than they would otherwise, but I think that's better than having the 
reactor spin-wait to consume time.

This probably only happens with the poll() reactor, because all the other 
APIs seem to have higher resolution timeouts --- select, epoll, kqueue, 
ppoll all have microsecond or even nanosecond timeout parameters.

If there is code that actually needs sub-millisecond timeout resolution it 
might be possible for Twisted to implement that using setitimer() or 
similar, but that seems like a lot of work to support an exotic use case 
that could be handled more efficiently by switching to epoll etc.

I checked the history of that line of code and it dates back all the way to 
the first poll()-based event loop implementation in 2001. Perhaps computers 
were slow enough back then that a call to poll() would take most of a 
millisecond :) but in any case the rounding-down behavior doesn't seem to have
been explicitly chosen.

&gt;<i> These _updateLogDateTime call seems to be a lot of complexity for no

</I>
Perhaps it is not the time() call but the cost of converting a time value 
to a string that is being avoided here? Sometimes the calendar/date 
calculations are expensive.

It seems to me that HTTPFactory could be implemented more efficiently by 
only caching the string on demand, and then setting a timer to clear the 
cache (reset _logDateTime to None) at the next 1-second mark. On a 
heavily-loaded server, that would have the same properties as the current 
code; but on a lightly-loaded server it would avoid running that callback 
unneccessarily. And overall I don't think it's any more complicated than 
the current implementation.

Wim.
