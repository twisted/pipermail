</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear Twisted people,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've been taking a good look at twisted.names as a sever after checking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> twisted-infra/braid/services/names and how the zones are saved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The way the zones are saved there is fairly primitive.  It would be nice
</I>&gt;<i> if we had a more robust backend; in particular I'd love it if we had a
</I>&gt;<i> DNS API so that e.g. <A HREF="https://github.com/glyph/lancer">https://github.com/glyph/lancer</A> could talk to
</I>&gt;<i> something on twistedmatrix.com &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com">http://twistedmatrix.com</A>&gt; to provision
</I>&gt;<i> HTTPS certificates via the LE DNS-01 challenge.
</I>

indeed, this is pretty much one of the main reasons why I am looking
into Twisted as a my DNS server :-).
Twisted DNS + Klein --&gt; (große) Awesomeness (reading Twisted's source
code, makes you prone to bad jokes, that should be an official warning
somewhere)


&gt;&gt;<i> Basically, I wonder what the state-of-afairs of running DNS with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> twisted is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We run it on production on twistedmatrix.com &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com">http://twistedmatrix.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> and that site sees plenty of DNS traffic :-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> By checking the code I see a couple things like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * That zone transfers are enabled by default and open to any host and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only subclassing would help override that (it is the case on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> twistedmatrix.com &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com">http://twistedmatrix.com</A>&gt; btw).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would certainly be nice if this were controllable via a flag.  As you
</I>&gt;<i> notice, this should be a ticket.
</I>
Done, ticket #9551.
(Trac always thinks I am Spam with probability 90%, wonders!)
<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9551">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9551</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> * Comments saying how some things are not RFC-compliant, but not how.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some investigation into these comments to make them more specific would
</I>&gt;<i> be good.
</I>
Also documented in ticket #9552; mostly to use trac as a quick overview.
<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9552">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9552</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> * That DNSSEC is not implemented
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the one hand, it would be great if someone would take the DNSSEC
</I>&gt;<i> support already in various branches and get it over the finish line.  On
</I>&gt;<i> the other, DNSSEC is bad (see
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/01/15/against-dnssec/">https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/01/15/against-dnssec/</A>&gt; for example),
</I>&gt;<i> and is really not necessary to run a real-life DNS server or client, so
</I>&gt;<i> it's a little difficult for various DNS-interested parties to get
</I>&gt;<i> excited about it.  Nonetheless if people are going to do DNSSEC I'd
</I>&gt;<i> rather they do it with Twisted than BIND, so if you could help integrate
</I>&gt;<i> DNSSEC work that is a definite goal for the project!  So I hope somebody
</I>&gt;<i> who disagrees with me about the utility of DNSSEC contributes to it.
</I>

:<i>-D I am also not fond of DNSSEC being *the* thing; but apparently email
</I>servers complain otherwise in certain environments.
Twisted supporting DNSSEC would indeed make things easier.


&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other points appear to be somewhat documented in the open tickets:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query?status=assigned&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;component=names&amp;group=priority&amp;max=200&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=milestone&amp;order=priority">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query?status=assigned&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;component=names&amp;group=priority&amp;max=200&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=milestone&amp;order=priority</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I wonder if there is something like a roadmap that I haven't seen or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a very specific way to start helping on this front.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right now the main thing we need is a motivated, interested maintainer
</I>&gt;<i> to advance these goals.  This email sounds suspiciously like
</I>&gt;<i> volunteering to be that :).
</I>
Ouch, I guess I'll have to invent a time-dilution bubble first :-D. I'll
see what I can do about this (DNS, not time-dilution bubble).

&gt;&gt;<i> Basically, I'd hate to start working on sth and it overlapping with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone else's work ;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's lots of other work in progress, but as you can see from most of
</I>&gt;<i> them, most of this work is stalled.  I'm 100% sure that if you started
</I>&gt;<i> working on some of these tickets, the people whose work you might
</I>&gt;<i> duplicate would be /overjoyed/ that someone had done that, so I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think you need to worry about stepping on anyone's toes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I checked a couple tickets, and see that there is definitely a need for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some cleanup, e.g. this one appears to be ready for closing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5048">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5048</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as it is marked as duplicate of a closed ticket.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please go ahead and close it if you are reasonably sure of that!
</I>
I was hoping for one of the involved parties remembering and saying &quot;oh
yeah, that should be closed&quot; otherwise it requires actual analysis, so
I'll leave that for some-time-soon.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also, I recall this PR from early summer, which appears to have been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OK'd but is blocked by some failure in appveyor + buildbot:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/954">https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/954</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sadly we don't have a queue of &quot;already approved&quot; tickets (that I know
</I>&gt;<i> of and check, anyway) so if this is stuck, it would be best to put it
</I>&gt;<i> back into review so it shows up on <A HREF="https://twisted.reviews/">https://twisted.reviews/</A> and gets
</I>&gt;<i> attention.
</I>
Added the review keyword again and removed the owner as per the
developer documentation.


Thank you for the helpful reply,
