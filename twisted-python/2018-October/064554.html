Thanks for asking :-).

My feeling on this is that the official mechanism here is the review queue, i.e. <A HREF="https://twisted.reviews/">https://twisted.reviews/</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://twisted.reviews/">https://twisted.reviews/</A>&gt;.  Regular contributors to the project should scan this periodically and try to do whatever reviews they can.

However, everybody requires some prompting sometimes, and it can often motivate some progress on an issue.  As long as you're not aggressively spamming anyone, I'm always a fan of reaching out via IRC, this mailing list, a mention on a PR, or whatever channel is appropriate to ping a potential reviewer.  A tried and true strategy is trading reviews - offering to review one of the reviewer's choice in exchange :).

Personally my github notifications are a smoking crater and I will pretty much never notice a &quot;requested review&quot; via that interface right now; however, I do hope that we can eventually make twisted.reviews actually point at the queue of &quot;review requested&quot; tickets on the Twisted project on github rather than being a trac report.  (One part of that workflow would be making @twisted/twisted-contributors automatically have a review requested for every open PR...)
