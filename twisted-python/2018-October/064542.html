That one's mine. I've finally figured out the Twisted CI infrastructure 
well enough to get things marked green (and I have commit access now as 
well, thanks Glyph!), so that PR is really only waiting for me to read &amp; 
consider some of the review feedback on public attribute names.

Trac 9373 was my attempt to upstream work I did last year on secure 
dynamic dns updates (NSUPDATE + transaction signatures). 9373 has narrowed 
in scope to just the two RR types in PR 954, since there are older tickets 
for the other records. I plan to combine my work with some of the existing 
abandoned PRs for KEY, DNSKEY, and SIG and try to sheperd those through 
the process but that's on the back burner for now.

Russ Nelson is/was also doing some work with Names and these RR types. I 
think he's interested in the server side of secure dyn-dns, but I'm not 
sure. (I was only working on a client implementation.) Both he and I have 
github forks with some of our work in branches, if you'd like to see the 
direction we've been going.

As for DNSSEC, I've seen those arguments against it and I find them pretty 
unconvincing, but I suppose that's a topic for a different thread.
