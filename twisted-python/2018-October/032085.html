</I>
Do you want a pull request for this fix or will you make this small change?

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This probably only happens with the poll() reactor, because all the other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; APIs seem to have higher resolution timeouts --- select, epoll, kqueue,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ppoll all have microsecond or even nanosecond timeout parameters.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If there is code that actually needs sub-millisecond timeout resolution it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might be possible for Twisted to implement that using setitimer() or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; similar, but that seems like a lot of work to support an exotic use case
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that could be handled more efficiently by switching to epoll etc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I checked the history of that line of code and it dates back all the way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the first poll()-based event loop implementation in 2001. Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; computers were slow enough back then that a call to poll() would take
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most of a millisecond :) but in any case the rounding-down behavior
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't seem to have been explicitly chosen.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; These _updateLogDateTime call seems to be a lot of complexity for no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; benefit. After all time.time() is very fast on Linux, why cache the log
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; time strings?&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps it is not the time() call but the cost of converting a time value
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to a string that is being avoided here? Sometimes the calendar/date
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; calculations are expensive.
</I>&gt;<i> I believe it dates back to a time when syscalls were surprisingly expensive,
</I>&gt;<i> and gettimeofday() or equivalent was still a syscall.  I remember looking
</I>&gt;<i> at profiles Back In The Day where getting the current time dominated. It
</I>&gt;<i> certainly predates the zero-overhead VDSO method available today.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems to me that HTTPFactory could be implemented more efficiently by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only caching the string on demand, and then setting a timer to clear the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cache (reset _logDateTime to None) at the next 1-second mark. On a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; heavily-loaded server, that would have the same properties as the current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code; but on a lightly-loaded server it would avoid running that callback
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unneccessarily. And overall I don't think it's any more complicated than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the current implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> The current algorithm is really just silly.  In the absence of a compelling
</I>&gt;<i> benchmark where it can be shown to hurt performance (we should check with
</I>&gt;<i> the ones on speed.twistedmatrix.com), I think we could forego the caching
</I>&gt;<i> entirely, and just do the simple thing where the string is computed as
</I>&gt;<i> needed.
</I>
I'll find time to put up a pull request to simplify and allow for on/off 
config of the logging for you to consider.

Barry
