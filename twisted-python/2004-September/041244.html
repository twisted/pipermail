Mr. Evans,

Hello, my name is Jonathan Simms, and I've been part of the Twisted core
team for a little over a year, and have worked for the Divmod
Corporation for ten months.

While working for Divmod, I wrote a web-based functional testing
framework to automate testing of their web application, Quotient. It
consisted of an HTTP client, a dom-parsing/inspection API, and a
test-descriptiopn API called &quot;Navtags&quot; that allowed a person to specify
the steps that the tests were to take traversing the site and the
assertions to be made without having to write nasty deferred callback
code. I wrote Divmod's release scripts, several repository-management
scripts, performance-statistics collection and stress testing code,
automated/remote application management code, and documentation pieces
for the developers.

I am currently refactoring the Twisted test framework, trial, and have
succeeded in making it three to four times faster than the current
version in Twisted's svn-trunk. It is now also easily extensible, and
will be integrated more tightly with Brian Warner's Buildbot program.
I have written tutorials on twisted, one of which was a step-by-step
tutorial on how to create a web application using the (now deprecated)
woven package. Another one, which is still in the works, deals with the
new zope.interface component system.

I have been working as part of a distributed team for almost a year now.
I am a competent programmer, a talented communicator, motivated, and I am
available immediately.

If it makes a difference, I have a Bachelor of Science degree in
Computer Science from the State University of New York.

If you need references, you can speak with Glyph Lefkowitz
(<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">glyph at divmod.com</A>) or JP Calderone (<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">exarkun at divmod.com</A>), either of whom
can speak for both the quality of my code, and my dedication to my work.

I would be very interested in talking with you further about what kind
of projects you have.

Thank You,

Jonathan Simms
