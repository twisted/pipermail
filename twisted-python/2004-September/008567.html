What is the &quot;average&quot; case anyway?  For what application?  Where are 
the performance tests coming from?

There is at least one scenario where it makes perfect sense to do a lot 
of callLater(0.0, ...), when you're doing computation but trying not to 
block.

Though, of course, you would do something like callLater(0.00001, ...) 
in the current Twisted, because callLater(0.0, ...) pretty much blocks.
