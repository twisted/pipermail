Hehe.  As Paul noted, yes, the SFTP Gateway does use his SFTP implementation.  
There's a lot of code there, but it's really just the code that implements 
the FTP client that the SFTP server uses as the backend (in 
sftpgateway.connector).  The FileTransferServer interface was finallized 
based substantially on what we did in SFTP Gateway.

I will note that it was written against Twisted 1.1.0, so the APIs on 
Twisted's side have changed a bit, but that mostly affects the code in 
sftpgateway.application and maybe sftpgateway.authentication.  From what I 
recall from a discussion with Paul at PyCon'04, the changes in Twisted really 
are an improvement.  I wish I had the time to bring that up to date.
