 &gt; runUntilCurrent happens every tick; callLater only happens sometimes.

Calling the method &quot;runUntilCurrent&quot;, yes. But that's not important. What makes a difference is that each iteration of the loop in runUntilCurrent is called at most once per callLater, so there is never fewer calls to callLater than iterations in runUntilCurrent - but in many cases there will be more calls to callLater, which gets even worse if you also count calls to cancel and reset. &quot;runUntilCurrent&quot; really is the right place to make the trade-off.


 &gt; Rather than say &quot;average&quot; applications: In my understanding, this will
 &gt; speed up applications that have lots of timed events scheduled at the
 &gt; expense of applications that transfer data over the network.

Just to make myself a bit clearer: runUntilCurrent only gets slower /per delayed call/. So if there are no delayed calls there should be no (measurable) slow down. But if there are delayed calls you will get the speed up.
