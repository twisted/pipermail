I think that's the way to go. That's actually easy to do, here's a patch against my implementation that does exactly that. It moves a bit more work into runUntilCurrent, but I think I already made my point in that regard.

</I>
In the cancelled case, it just pops the cancelled call - done (and obviously correct). In the delayed case it pops the changed call (that possibly temporarily brakes the heap invariant) and replaces it with itself, so it actually re-inserts the call at the right position.

Though, ... I guess I do see a problem if the value of a call somewhere in the heap is changed. That brakes the heap invariant and may conflict with further changes to the heap. Let me think about it.
