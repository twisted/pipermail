</I>
The twisted 1.3 release will available for download for the forseeable
future, for those who need it.  I don't believe we should release stuff
with subtle, broken semantics in twisted 2.0 - the release number
implies that we are changing a few things, so this would be a good
opportunity to abandon support for the old code.

&gt;<i> I don't see any sane way to perform a complete

</I>&gt;<i> never quite work anyway, and wouldn't really benefit anyone in 
</I>&gt;<i> particular.
</I>
If there is to be no backwards compatibility, why bother with the
separate namespace?  Do we want to do this with other modules in the
future, e.g. twisted.spread2?  Our last discussion of this was
inconclusive because I don't think we foresaw the web rewrite being so
radically different.  I guess we have to drag that dead horse out here
to beat it one more time ;).

Even if the namespace changes, there should only be one of these in svn
at a time.  If further development on twisted web 1 is going to continue
it should be in a maintenance branch, and then we need to discuss how
we're going to manage maintenance releases.

&gt;<i> We already figured out which web server we (&quot;we&quot; being those developers 
</I>&gt;<i> who actually care about the web) are going to be supporting. 
</I>&gt;<i> twisted.web2. web should have a deprecation warning in __init__ for a 
</I>&gt;<i> release, and then should be terminated with extreme prejudice.
</I>
I would terminate before providing a deprecation warning.  If you want
to provide a backwards-compatibility release for using web1 with the new
reactor core, that's fine, but I don't see any reason to include web1
with the new download.

&gt;<i> As far as the nevow dependency, [...] you're not going to get much out of the box.
</I>
It really sounds like nevow and web2 ought to be merged.  Traffic on the
twisted-web list suggests that anyone who is using one is using the
other, at least in some capacity.  The marketing aspect of this
certainly requires some discussion, but it seems that one's utility is
greatly reduced without the other, and the dependency is circular.  For
specialized cases, such as using nevow for CGI scripts, there is no
problem with having the other code around as long as it can avoid being
imported.
