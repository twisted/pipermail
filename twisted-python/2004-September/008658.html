Well, certainly nobody who wrote the original twisted.web code is 
supporting it, but that doesn't mean it's unusable. On the contrary, 
it's very usable, and there are probably lots and lots of applications 
which depend on all sorts of subtle and broken semantics it uses 
(people being far more interested in developing web related things than 
finger related things). I don't see any sane way to perform a complete 
rewrite with better semantics while still living in the old twisted.web 
namespace, especially given the miniscule amount of time most of the 
major developers of this project have to put against it. Developing 
backwards compatibility with the old APIs would be a death march, would 
never quite work anyway, and wouldn't really benefit anyone in 
particular.

We already figured out which web server we (&quot;we&quot; being those developers 
who actually care about the web) are going to be supporting. 
twisted.web2. web should have a deprecation warning in __init__ for a 
release, and then should be terminated with extreme prejudice.

As far as the nevow dependency, I have already suggested to James that 
twisted.web2 should work without it, but he didn't feel it was worth 
the effort. If it is worth the effort to someone else, I suggest they 
do it. My suggestion is simply not to have pages like directory 
listings and traceback renderings, but to have simple string templates 
which are returned in the case of nevow not being installed. This way 
you can use web2 with no dependencies to do a completely custom web 
server, but you're not going to get much out of the box.
