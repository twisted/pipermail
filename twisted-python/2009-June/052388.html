This is definitely one of the big shortcomings of .tac files.  I generally
approach this by absolutely minimizing the amount of code in the .tac file
itself.  This doesn't help you test the code that's there, but if you're
limited to importing a function that creates your service, calling that
function, and attaching it to the application object, at least there's
very little code that's untested, and it should be modified very
infrequently.

I welcome any suggestions for a better answer than this one.  It would
probably be easy to make a case for the inclusion of some APIs to help
out tests.  `twisted.application.service.loadApplicationÂ´ might even
go towards this end already - I've never tried writing a test using it,
but maybe that would work out well.
