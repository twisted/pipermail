cibuildwheel does have an option to provide a test command.  If we did 
that would we replace the existing tests or supplement?  If 
supplementing that will presumably be a significant increase in build 
times.  Especially if we did it for all wheels.

So, how much of a build time hit do we want to take?

It looks like the builds I added in my wheel PR, for whatever that is 
worth.  Well, other than picking xcode v9 vs me picking v10 which 
neither of the PRs use anyways.  I added the requires over in the wheel 
PR as well in case it ends up saving a useful amount of our OS X quota.

&gt;&gt;<i> Now that I've got something rough in place, are there any opinions

</I>
Uhm...  hmm...  *shrug*  I figured someone might want to do a final spot 
check or have manual intervention for a real release.  You can't replace 
a file on PyPI so...  but sure, I didn't mean to argue against 
automation.

Here's one spot I did automatic deployment off of Travis to PyPI.

<A HREF="https://github.com/altendky/gitignoreio/blob/aeeb9546b6f27f411b191699d3625b4d0a08e7cf/.travis.yml#L11-L19">https://github.com/altendky/gitignoreio/blob/aeeb9546b6f27f411b191699d3625b4d0a08e7cf/.travis.yml#L11-L19</A>

Pretty straightforward though I think it does the wheel build which 
isn't what we'd really want.  I'd have to check on how to deploy 
existing wheels as well as those from OS X and Windows.  I'd suggest a 
separate PR?  I mean maybe it'd be easier to get one PR reviewed than 
two but that doesn't seem like a great reason to mash things together.

Cheers,
-kyle
