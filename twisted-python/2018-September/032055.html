</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Definitely replace.  What would you want to even supplement them with?
</I>
I was referring to supplementing the existing src tests with the wheel 
tests.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, how much of a build time hit do we want to take?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking that for starters here the goal would just be build
</I>&gt;<i> automation, independent of trying to get a more realistic test path;
</I>&gt;<i> only doing these builds when pushing a relevant tag.  If it's easy to
</I>&gt;<i> just switch over everything to this then... great, I guess? :)  But
</I>&gt;<i> let's not gild the lily here.
</I>
Alrighty, another PR for swapping over tests from src to wheels.

I would tend to always build the wheels.  It's easier for people to test 
intermediate releases for bugs.  It makes a release 'less special' so 
there is less likely to be a latent issue with the process or artifacts. 
  Etc.  But, let's see what the build time hit is.

Travis: 4 minutes, about half the time of a single version test job
AppVeyor: 7 minutes, about the same as a single version test job
Circle OS X: 9 minutes, a bit over a single version test job
Circle Linux: 5 minutes, a bit under a single (OS X) version test job

Ok, so for about the cost of testing a single Python version we can get 
wheels.  Especially if we want to switch over to testing wheels instead 
of source, I'd plan on building wheels for every commit.

&gt;&gt;<i> but sure, I didn't mean to argue against automation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could we do a test run by uploading wheels to, say,
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://test.pypi.org">https://test.pypi.org</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://test.pypi.org/">https://test.pypi.org/</A>&gt; first?
</I>
Shall the process be build wheel, upload to test PyPI, install from test 
PyPI, test...  :]  But sure, I could see ending up with a test PyPI 
upload at least for a tag/release.  Could technically do it for every 
build but that seems excessive, even given my comments above about 
exercising the process more often rather than less.

&gt;&gt;<i> Here's one spot I did automatic deployment off of Travis to PyPI.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/altendky/gitignoreio/blob/aeeb9546b6f27f411b191699d3625b4d0a08e7cf/.travis.yml#L11-L19">https://github.com/altendky/gitignoreio/blob/aeeb9546b6f27f411b191699d3625b4d0a08e7cf/.travis.yml#L11-L19</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pretty straightforward though I think it does the wheel build which 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> isn't what we'd really want.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's pretty cool.  I assumed you'd have to write a 'twine' command -
</I>&gt;<i> Travis just has a 'deploy' provider called &quot;pypi&quot;?  What's actually
</I>&gt;<i> happening behind the scenes there, I wonder!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Also, you should probably upload an sdist as well as a bdist_wheel;
</I>&gt;<i> there are cases where wheels aren't always what you want.)
</I>
Yeah, it's cool but then you have to know what is behind it...  for each 
CI host...  and how to make it use the files you want...  So I'd tend 
towards a twine call.  I made this silly little script the other day to 
handle this in another repo.

&gt;&gt;<i> I'd have to check on how to deploy existing wheels as well as those 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from OS X and Windows.  I'd suggest a separate PR?  I mean maybe it'd 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be easier to get one PR reviewed than two but that doesn't seem like a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> great reason to mash things together.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Smaller PRs are always easier to review - they just take more latency
</I>&gt;<i> to build :).
</I>
Ok, I'll make separate tickets for:

* Testing wheels vs. src
* Automatic deployment to PyPI

Cheers,
