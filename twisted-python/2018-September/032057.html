<PRE>Hi, Glyph,

That's a little more blam than this little script really needs, though I
appreciate the suggestion.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah. Also noted when I saw it. Again, seemed to be more effort than I
wanted, though if someone were to say &quot;well, that's what you're stuck with
if you use that legacy stuff&quot; I'd be off to do the thing.


&gt;<i> I'm very curious what is going on here, and whether it's a logging system
</I>&gt;<i> bug.  Could you whittle this down to a minimal reproducer?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The sad part is that when I went to put together  the minimal reproducer,
the problem went away.

There is something in my code somewhere that is causing this. I have no
idea what it is, yet, but when I put together a minimal web server that
uses twisted.reactor.callLater() to periodically start a background task,
Twisted is not grabbing stdout or even pushing its own logging to sdtout.

I think it might be how I set up the original project in my IDE - for the
sample project, I started with a clean directory and clean project file
(PyCharm if it matters). So I'm gonna pursue that further.  I think that it
might be the IDE's environment if you tell it &quot;this is a Flask project&quot;. I
was seeing weird things from the minimal example as well until I cleared
out all the IDE meta files and reinitiated it as a &quot;pure Python&quot; (in
PyCharm terms) project.

Thanks for your time and thanks for the push that got me moving (hopefully)
in the right direction. :)

 Regards,

Jeff
