Thanks, but this does not fix it. The deprecation warning is:

/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/twisted/conch/ssh/userauth.py:376: DeprecationWarning: signData is deprecated since Twisted Conch 0.9.  Use Key(obj).sign(data).
  return keys.signData(privateKey, signData)

I still get this warning even if I change my code to remove ".keyObject"
but authentication no longer works if I do that. It looks like this is
actually a bug in my copy of userauth.py (although it is not a serious
problem - just a deprecation warning). I could get around the
problem by reimplementing the signData method in SSHUserAuthClient.
I am using version 8.1.0 as distributed by Debian, i.e.
http://packages.debian.org/lenny/python-twisted-conch

Hi, the correct thing to do is to write a unittest for it (in [1]) and a
patch and attach it to a ticket on the Twisted website.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] HTTP interface to a program using twisted
Message-ID: <4896B43A.9060700@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone,

I have a program using twisted and I'd like it to obtain it's data via 
the HTTP protocol. The idea is that the clients will connect to a 
service using HTTP and will send it data encapsulated in the HTTP. The 
data will be extracted and sent on to another service to process  it, 
which will in turn send the processed data back to the HTTP service to 
send back to the client. I think twisted.web and/or twisted.web2 should 
be used for this, is that correct? I don't quite get the difference in 
between web/web2, could someone please enlighten me? I have read the 
documentation but it doesn't say much.

Thank you,
Gabriel Rossetti

Use twisted.web - twisted.web2 will have all its good bits stolen and 
put into .web, then be (I guess) deprecated:

  http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedWebPlan

Can someone with access re-add this prominent link to the twistedmatrix 
front page?

Ok, but I just want to make sure first it's better to use twisted.web 
rather than implementing my own protocol, since I won't be serving any 
web pages and to me it seams twisted.web is designed to serve web content.

No. twisted.web is a general HTTP server. You can use it to implement 
XMLRPC, JSON-RPC or various other non-HTML HTTP applications, as well as 
HTML pages.

Hello All,

For some strange reason I this text is being added to the end of the html
pages rendered by twisted.
Request did not return a string

Request:

<GET /config/deleteSection HTTP/1.1>


Resource:

<configPages.deleteSection instance at 0x00EC4EE0>


Value:

None

I am using the resource.Resource and render. My html is passed has a string
using request.write.
As far has I can tell, there should not be a problem. Does anyone know why
and what I need to do to fix this.

Hello All,

I have written a small twisted application that I am trying to access over
http.
I have successfully created a tap file using mktap, but I still cannot
access the
application using http. Does anyone know how this is done ?

Python functions implicitly return None if there is no return statement.

Twisted.web wants the render method to either return a string, or the 
special object NOT_DONE_YET, which indicates that the reply will be written 
with request.write(). The name was probably chosen for cases where the 
content is written using deferreds, but it should be used even if you call 
request.write() from the render method.

So try putting "return server.NOT_DONE_YET" at the end of your render 
method.

Bye,
		Maarten

If you do need to do any of your own protocol work, surely it would be 
easier to write a few patches for twisted.web than to do the whole thing 
over again :).

If you did

    mktap foo bar baz

to make your tap file, instead do

    twistd foo bar baz

to start the server with your desired configuration rather than 
outputting a tap file.

Tap files are not a really good mechanism for dealing with configuration 
and are being slowly phased out in favor of running twistd plugins 
directly.

I want to create a server in twisted that has a permanent variable which i
want to use as the number of request requested to the server. When i use
that for Protocol, each time the variable is created newly.

Then i used
*class Echo(Protocol):
    def dataReceived(self, data):

        if "data" not in dir(self.factory):
            self.factory.data = 0
        self.factory.data = self.factory.data + 1

        """As soon as any data is received, write it back."""
        self.transport.write(data + str(self.factory.data))


but i want to remove the code that is:

**        if "data" not in dir(self.factory):
            self.factory.data = 0
        self.factory.data = self.factory.data + 1


How to do that?

Hi JP

I think Squzer meant that he'd like to put the initialization code elsewhere.

Squzer, why not do the initialization of self.factory.data when the factory
is created, and then increment the variable each time a connection is made?

Will request.finish have the same effect as return server.NOT_DONE_YET ?
Or do the statements do different things ?

You have to use both: call request.finish() when you are done writing and 
return NOT_DONE_YET from the render method.

(forwarding for Daniel who had some list posting trouble)

Hi all-
I'd like to use Twisted to manage bluetooth communication. I haven't
found any existing method for doing this, so I'd like to write and
implement a new reactor interface (on par with TCP/UDP) that wraps the
lightblue library. What's the right way to go about extending Twisted in
this way?
Thanks,
Daniel

A lot of reactors implement `IReactorFDSet?:

If you don't mind that some reactors don't implement this, you can
use it to implement bluetooth support.

If you get stuck, and list doesn't help, show up to next Twisted sprint
and maybe one of us can help.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Jython reactor - a proposal
Message-ID: <1qwea36yndtit.ci6snfvp7paz.dlg@40tude.net>

Hello everybody,
I recently took a look at the current Jython status, and it seems to me
that the latest alpha provides a good compatibility towards the standard
CPython. 

I'd really like running jython+twisted, so when I realized there was no
reactor available for such platform I took some time to analyze the issue:

- An old-and-incomplete java reactor existed in Twisted 1.3 which used
java.io.
- java.nio would be a better choice to implement such a reactor since java
1.4
- a wrapper around java.nio called EIO existed (
http://java.twistedmatrix.com/eio/ ) but there seems no way to take a peek
at it since there's no file that can be accessed beyond its home page
(every single link is broken :-( )
- a kind of async networking library called Apache Mina is avaiable for
java, and it makes use of java.nio
- other java-reactor pattern implementations are available around (e.g.
assorted on sourceforge ).

So, it seems java.nio is the right way to go and there's quite a lot of
code around to look at. Since I'd like to code a java reactory, I've got
some questions:
- any other clue? Is there anything else I should look at before starting
my code?
- is there any way I could be given commit access to a private branch on
twisted svn repository? i could set up a repo elsewhere, but this would
make synchronization and merging a bit more painful and slow.
- is there any other similar project ongoing by anyone else?

Thanks!

Hi list,

I'm currently in the process of hacking together TIPC[1] support for Twisted. 
I've got reliable datagram support in a "works for me" state now.

Is anyone interested to see this in Twisted? Thought I'd rather ask here 
before opening a ticket etc.

Alan Franzoni was kind enough to say:

[cut]

I just discovered jython provides the select module as well (I wouldn't
ever think of that), I'm performing some tests with that before going on
with a brand-new reactor.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] foolscap copyable and constraint
Message-ID: <20080809090217.GA8379@lemurdoc>

ciao! i'm playing a bit with foolscap and i try to use RemoteInterface
to describe my constraint but i cannot understand how to use it with
pass-by-copy. this is a small example:


    from foolscap import RemoteInterface, registerCopier, \
            registerRemoteCopyFactory

    class Label:
        def __init__(self, text):
            self.text = text


    def copyLabel(label):
        return ('_Label', {'text': label.text})

    registerCopier(Label, copyLabel)

    def makeLabel(state):
        label = Label(state['text'])
        return label

    registerRemoteCopyFactory('_Label', makeLabel)


    class RITest(RemoteInterface):
        def getLabel():
            return Label


but what i get is:
foolscap.tokens.UnknownSchemaType: can't make constraint from
'__main__.Label' (<type 'classobj'>)

which is the correct way to define a constraint for a third party-class?

Yes, the regular Twisted sprints are held in Cambridge, MA.

Shall we have another one soon? I'm available outside of September 6-20.

Not me, I'm camping on the Cape that weekend (not that I'm much
practical help at sprints :/). How about 16-17 or 23-24?

Well my schedule should definitely not carry much weight since I am 
totally new to this, bet here goes:
Not available - From now till Sept 2nd, and weekend of Sept 13th. 
Otherwise - will do my best to make it and drag one or two others with me.
(Oh, and I AM located in Cambridge, MA)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] AsynQueue: return deferred from queued method
Message-ID: <1218464394.7686.19.camel@localhost>

Hello List,

I'm trying to use AsynQueue for queuing requests for a synchronous
protocol (emi/ucp). Is it possible to return a deferred from the queued
method so the next method in the queue is only called after the deferred
from the first was fired? Or is there a better way to handle synchronous
protocols where i have to wait for an answer of a message sent over the
wire before i can send another one?

Thanks,

Stephan

Just use a single implementer of IWorker that only accepts one 
assignment at a time. The queue will not feed it its next task until the 
deferred from its previous one has fired.

What you're trying to do is exactly what AsynQueue is for. For example, 
my sAsync package uses AsynQueue to feed database queries to the SQLite 
database engine one at a time in a single thread.

If you have multiple connections that each can handle successive 
requests successively, but independently the other connection, you can 
simply use an IWorker implementer for each one. (I don't know that 
emi/ucp has any way of doing this.) Then the queue will feed requests to 
whoever is ready, one at a time.

I use this for running jobs asynchronously over a cluster of CPU nodes. 
The queue gets fed thousands of tasks nearly at once, and parcels them 
out one at a time to each node. Some CPU nodes run faster than others, 
and the queueing makes that all work out fine.

Please note that there is also a very simple and elegant queue object in 
twisted.internet.defer that might meet your needs without the complexity 
(and capability) of AsynQueue.

Feel free to contact me offline if you have additional questions on this.

Best regards,
Ed Suominen

Hello,

I'm needing to send small packets to update a progress bar. My update

setTcpNoDelay() in connectionMade() but it doesn't change anything, is 
it broken?

Thank you,

I an using code that I wrote using threads.deferToThread(), I wondered 
if it was blocking the reactor maybe, so I tried just using a plain 
deferToThread() call. Here's the code (without all the protocol stuff, 
it's executed when data come in.

    def loop(self):
        import time
        m = utils.createMessage("toto", "hello")
        while(True):
            print "Sending %s" % m.toXml()
            self.sendMessage(m)
            print "Sent!"
            time.sleep(2)


threads.deferToThread(self.loop)

the TCP no delay option is turned on like I said before, the weird thing 
is that I have the same thing, all my msgs get sent in big blocks. 
Either the TCP no delay doesn't work, or the reactor is getting tied up. 
I don' t get it since I'm running the blocking code in a thread, the 
reactor should have nothing to do.

Thank you,
Gabriel

P.S.
I know that I'm not returning a deferred, I am in my real code though, 
but this is just "debug" code.

Since you didn't include the definition of `sendMessage?, it's hard to say
what's really going on here.  However, my guess is that you're calling the
transport.write method in a non-reactor thread, which is not allowed.

If this isn't the case, including a full, minimal example in your next
message would be a good idea. :)

Yes, self.sendMessage() calls transport.write. So there's no way of 
sending msgs from a non-reactor thread, even if it has a reference to 
the protocol?

There is a way.  The way is to use reactor.callFromThread to schedule a
function to be called in the reactor thread.

eg, reactor.callFromThread(self.sendMessage)

use reactor.callFromThread, which takes as an argument a function to
call in the reactor thread. That function can use Twisted APIs like
transport.write. Most Twisted APIs are not thread-safe, and cannot be
called from a non-reactor thread.

> ciao! i'm playing a bit with foolscap and i try to use RemoteInterface
> to describe my constraint but i cannot understand how to use it with

My memory is a bit fuzzy, but I think Copyables aren't as mature as they
ought to be, and we don't yet have a way to express a constraint that allows
a Copyable as an argument. When I hit a need for this in Tahoe, I punted and
used an Any() (which just allows anything through).

There's a foolscap.copyable.AttributeDictConstraint, which can be used to
control what gets to go into the Copyable (store an instance of it in the
.stateSchema attribute of your RemoteCopy class, or provide it as the
stateSchema= argument to registerRemoteCopyFactory.. see
foolscap/test/test_copyable.py MyRemoteCopy4 for an example). It might be
used something like this (untested):

 label_constraint = copyable.AttributeDictConstraint( ("text", str) )
 registerRemoteCopyFactory("_Label", makeLabel, label_constraint)

But that doesn't get you the next-higher-level part.

>     class RITest(RemoteInterface):
>         def getLabel():
>             return Label

That's the desired syntax for this sort of constraint, but it doesn't work
yet. We could fix that.. the approach would be:

 1: create a CopyableConstraint class, inheriting from constraint.Constraint,
    and created with a Copyable subclass (or maybe a RemoteCopy subclass)
    1a: implement CopyableConstraint.checkObject(), somehow. If inbound=False
        then it should probably assert an isinstance(obj, myCopyableClass).
        If inbound=True, it should probably check against myRemoteCopyClass
        instead. checkObject() is used outbound before serialization, and
        inbound post-deserialization; i.e. it examines fully-formed objects
        rather than individual tokens.
 2: add code to schema.adapt_obj_to_iconstraint() (or register an adapter)
    that knows how to create a CopyableConstraint from a Copyable or
    RemoteCopy class.

There is a small design issue.. should the constraint reference the Copyable,
or the RemoteCopy? I.e. should your getLabel() interface method say "return
Label" or "return RemoteLabel"? It depends upon how you want to read the
RemoteInterface.. from the point of view of the sender, or that of the
receiver. My casual thought is to use the Copyable.

This makes more difference in constraints that specify pass-by-proxy objects:

 class RIRow(RemoteInterface):
   def get_value(): return int

 class RIDatabase(RemoteInterface)
   def get_row(rownum=int): return RIRow

where the question is: does the get_row() method return a Referenceable
(which gets turned into a RemoteReference by the time it gets to the remote
caller), or are we saying that it has to return a RemoteReference that is
hosted on the caller's side (such that it gets turned back into a local
Referenceable byt the time it gets to that caller). The former is a lot more
useful, but there might be situations where you want to express the latter,
so it would be nice if there were a syntax for it.

I don't remember if there is such a syntax right now, but my point is that
this sort of distinction doesn't show up with pass-by-copy objects like
Copyable. The caller always receives a RemoteCopy of some sort.


hope that helps,
 -Brian

Thank you Jean-Paul & Christopher, I hadn't realized that. Now I 
understand better why in deferToThread() you use 
reactor.callFromThread() to add callbacks/errbacks. So if I understand, 
anything that uses twisted, that I'd need to call from a thread, needs 
to be called with reactor.callFromThread().

Would something like this be ok?

from zope.interface import implements
from asynqueue import IWorker

class DeferredWorker(object):
    
    implements(IWorker)
    cQualified = []
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.iQualified = []
        
    def run(self, task):
        self.task = task
        f, args, kw = task.callTuple
        d = f(*args, **kw)
        d.addCallbacks(task.callback, task.errback)
        return d

    def setResignator(self, callableObject):

    def stop(self):
        pass
    
    def crash(self):

At least it seems to do the job ;)

Hello!

Is there any way I can make twisted stop accepting connections for a short period of time and then start accepting connections? Something like reactor.pause()?

More precisely, what I want to do is to reread my server configuration on SIGHUP (or some other external event). If possible I would like to do this without locking a mutex when accessing (reading or modifying) the configuration info. I figure that reconfiguring the server will be a rare event. So if there is some way that I can:

1. Block incoming requests. Preferable keeping them in the connection queue.
2. Wait for all running requests to complete.
3. Reread the server configuration.
4. Unblock incoming requests. 

What do you think? Is there some simple twisted-way to do this?

If this has been covered in the past, please point me in that direction. :-)

Regards,
Mattias

Subject: [Twisted-Python] twisted python conch SSH shell?
Message-ID: <74a0fd5f0808121340pdf0e46egd4dfb9b1c10cbaf4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been playing around with Twisted's Conch client (which looks extremely
well done, thanks!). I've been able to connect to a conch server and also
connect to other ssh servers and execuate various commands. I'd like to be
able to connect to an arbitrary SSH server and run /bin/bash.

I'm able to execute a command like so:

---------------------
class CommandChannel(channel.SSHChannel):
    ....
    def channelOpen(self, data):
        self.conn.sendRequest(
            self, 'exec', common.NS(self.command),
wantReply=True).addCallback(
            self._gotResponse)
---------------------

Looking through the SSH spec (connect protocol, rfc4254), it looks like
shells are opened with this command.

---------------------

      byte      SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST
      uint32    recipient channel
      string    "shell"
      boolean   want reply

---------------------

It doesn't look like Conch supports these requests (here's how
CHANNEL_REQUESTs are currently sent out)

---------------------
(Twisted-8.1.0)
twisted/conch/ssh/connection.py (413):
        self.transport.sendPacket(MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST, struct.pack('>L',
                                    self.channelsToRemoteChannel[channel])
                                  + common.NS(requestType)+chr(wantReply)
                                  + data)
---------------------

I may be misunderstanding how remote shells are started, so any help would
be appreciated.

Again, I'm trying to launch an interactive /bin/bash shell from a Conch SSH
client on an arbitrary remote SSH server.

Thanks for your time.

Best Regards,
Bill Zeller

Nice comparison.  A more idiomatic rendering of the "raw deferred"
example might look like this, though:

  def lookup(country, search_term):
      query = "http://www.google.%s/search?q=%s" % (country,search_term)
      d = getPage(query)
      def cbFirstPage(content, country):
          m = re.search('<div id="?res.*?href="(?P<url>http://[^"]+)"',
                        content, re.DOTALL)
          if not m:
              return None
          url = m.group('url')
          d = getPage(url)
          def cbSecondPage(content, country, url):
              m = re.search("<title>(.*?)</title>", content)
              if m:
                  title = m.group(1)
                  return dict(url = url, title = title)
              else:
                  return dict(url=url, title="<not-specified>")
          d.addCallback(cbSecondPage, country, url)
          return d
      d.addCallback(cbGotPage, country)
      def ebGeneric(err, country):
          print ".%s FAILED: %s" % (country, str(e))
      d.addErrback(ebGeneric, country)
      return d

Converting any failure into a print and a None result is a bit strange,
but it's the same thing your other two examples did so I preserved that
behavior.

Hmm, I'd be glad to add this to the article in a way or another,
would you mind it?

(btw, I find my "raw" example more readable, but this is likely a
matter of taste...)

Just wanted to do something illustrating error handling

Thanks for writing this up!  It always makes me happy to see the 
ecosystem around Twisted developing, people blogging about stuff like 
this.  Makes it feel like a real project.

Of course it would make it feel even more like a real project if you 
could be convinced to contribute to the official documentation :). 
There's no mention of inlineCallbacks in the official documentation (the 
stuff in doc/) at all, and it would be helpful to have at least an 
overview.

Message-ID: <41beb4dc0808140426g42c45025y2f75a0d41d0ae373@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I posted the following to the web mailing list but on second thoughts
I think that it's kinda a problem with my understanding of the other
parts of the framework, so I'm reposting it here. I'd appreciate any
pointers. It's a bit lengthy, so apologies for that.



I'm looking into adding HTTPS support to the proxy module for some
testing I'm doing. I'd like to be able to trap requests and responses
as they go to and from the server, so proper CONNECT support is not
really what I'm aiming for. I've come up with the following:

"""
from twisted.web import proxy, http
from twisted.internet import reactor, ssl
from twisted.python import log
import sys
import urlparse

from OpenSSL import SSL as OSSL

class MyProxyClient(proxy.ProxyClient):

   def handleEndHeaders(self):
       print "THOSE HEADERS DONE ENDED"
       self.father.transport.write("\r\n")

   def handleResponsePart(self, buffer):
       print "GOT SOME STUFF TO SEND TO THE BROWSER"
       self.father.transport.write(buffer)

   def dataReceived(self, data):
       print "To the Browser"
       print data # Data sent to the browser
       proxy.ProxyClient.dataReceived(self, data)

   def handleResponseEnd(self):
       print "losing connection..."
       self.transport.loseConnection()
       self.father.channel.transport.loseConnection()


class MyProxyClientFactory(proxy.ProxyClientFactory):
   def buildProtocol(self, addr):
       client = proxy.ProxyClientFactory.buildProtocol(self, addr)
       client.__class__ = MyProxyClient
       return client

class MySSLContext(ssl.ContextFactory):
   def getContext(self):
       ctx = OSSL.Context(OSSL.SSLv23_METHOD)
       ctx.use_certificate_file('server.cert')
       ctx.use_privatekey_file('server.pkey')
       return ctx

class MyProxyRequest(proxy.ProxyRequest):
   protocols = {
           'http': MyProxyClientFactory,
           'https': MyProxyClientFactory
           }
   ports = {
           'http': 80,
           'https': 443
           }

   def requestDone(self, request):
       """Called by first request in queue when it is done."""
       print "REQUESTDONE DONE BE CALLED"
       if request != self.requests[0]: raise TypeError
       del self.requests[0]

       if self.persistent:
           # notify next request it can start writing
           if self.requests:
               self.requests[0].noLongerQueued()
           else:
               if self._savedTimeOut:
                   self.setTimeout(self._savedTimeOut)
       else:
           print "lOSING CONNECTION"
           self.transport.loseConnection()

   def process(self):
       parsed = urlparse.urlparse(self.uri)
       protocol = parsed.scheme
       host = parsed.hostname
       doSSL = False
       if self.method.upper() == "CONNECT":
           self.transport.write("HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established\r\n\r\n")
           self.transport.startTLS(MySSLContext())
           protocol = "https"
           self.host = parsed.scheme
           print "finished connect request"
       else:
           if self.isSecure():
               headers = self.getAllHeaders().copy()
               host = headers["host"]
               protocol = "https"
               doSSL = True
           port = self.ports[protocol]
           if ':' in host:
               host, port = host.split(':')
               port = int(port)
           rest = urlparse.urlunparse(('', '') + parsed[2:])
           if not rest:
               rest = rest + '/'
           class_ = self.protocols[protocol]
           headers = self.getAllHeaders().copy()
           if 'host' not in headers:
               headers['host'] = host
           self.content.seek(0, 0)
           s = self.content.read()
           clientFactory = class_(self.method, rest, self.clientproto, headers,

       print data # Data sent to the server
       proxy.Proxy.dataReceived(self, data)

   def requestFactory(self, *args):
       return MyProxyRequest(*args)

class ProxyFactory(http.HTTPFactory):
       protocol = MyProxy

reactor.listenTCP(8081, ProxyFactory())
log.startLogging(sys.stdout) # Log to the console
reactor.run()
"""

Most of the magic is happening in the 'process' method. I've copied
some of the other methods in for debugging. At the moment it's a bit
hackish but it's almost working as expected. When a connect request is
received then the SSL connection is set up as required (using
transport.startTLS). This generates certificate mismatch errors in the
browser, but this is expected and is what I'm looking for as then I can read the
requests as they come through.
The GET request is then received from the browser and forwarded on to the
server. The server appears to be happy with this as it does pass the
appropriate response back to the proxy. For some reason, however, the
browser does not then get passed the response. Comparing identical
requests for the HTTP and HTTPS versions of a site show that the only
apparent difference is that the headers and body are sent in one go
under HTTP and as two separate chunks under HTTPS.

E.g. HTTPS:

The HTTPS version seems to have an extra line feed being added after

I've got a feeling that I'm not quite going about this in the correct

It's really necesary do that?

1 Your app have a reference to a object whith the loaded config
2 A defered take a reference to these object
3 A reread event change the app config reference to new loaded config
object. Old defered no change his reference and end whith old config.
4 New defereds take new config and reference that.
5 When old config object have not references is garbaged collected.

No blocking operation is nedded if you can load 2 configuration
objects in memory (the old one for connections in progress and the new
one).

Excuse my poor english.

Javi

I recently discovered elisa. A media center implemented with twisted python.
Elisa have a bluetoth plugin than use py-bluez (other bt library). The
code is here:

http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~elisa-developers/elisa/upicek/annotate/11.5.55?filter_file_id=bluetooth_input.py-20080401102113-vcj3p4systzzapcn-411&file_id=bluetooth_input.py-20080401102113-vcj3p4systzzapcn-411

I don't know if it is useful for you.

My Twisted server is listening on two ports: 80 for processing http

http logs seem to clutter my log file. Is there any way to disable
http logs only and leave

different file?

Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <9263743c0808160504m1bf01afbiff248d7899c4f8dc@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
I try to implement a custom ssh server with twisted . I use* sshserver.py to
begin (* http://www.devshed.com/c/a/Python/SSH-with-Twisted/ )
I would like to execute interactive scripts which are on my server. The
problem is theses scripts are interactives. How can I redirect IO on my
shell ?
For example, if I want to install a software with apt. I have questions to
install dependencies ( yes/no)
I start to create a definition for this function like def do_apt. And then
when in my custom shell I execute ( apt python)., that executes apt-get
install python on the server. But how can I redirect the output in my shell
to answer dependencies questions ?
Thanks for your help

If you pass a filename for the `logPath? parameter to `Site?, request
logs will be written to that file instead of to the main log.

To run a program like apt, you must be using `reactor.spawnProcess?.  That
means that you have two different protocol implementations.  One to talk
to the SSH connection (eg, `SSHDemoProtocol? in the O'Reilly example) and
one to talk to the child process.

If you want output from the child process to show up in the SSH client, then
when the process protocol receives data from it, it should pass it on to the
SSH protocol to write to the client.  Similarly, if you want input from the
SSH client written to the stdin of the child process, when the SSH protocol
receives data it should pass it on to the process protocol to write to the
child process.

You'll have to keep track of what state your application is in to do this
correctly.  Input should only be handled this way when there is actually
a child process running.

Thanks very much Jean-Paul for your answer.
I will try to implement reactor.spawnProcess with this example.

Hi all,

In my opinion, I like twisted very much but my coworkers are all quite
unfamiliar with Python.  And also we are afraid of source code leak problem.

So, can you remember some similar framework in C/C++ world?

Understandable, but it might be worthwhile to learn.  Python can be a 
much more productive language than C++.
>And also we are afraid of source code leak problem.

If your users are savvy enough to extract Python source code from a 
trivially obfuscated executable, they are probably savvy enough to 
extract the information they want by decompiling your C++ binaries too. 
There are a lot of people who are really very skilled at this.  You 
should not assume that just because you are using C or C++, your source 
code is safe.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] wxPython integration & msg sending from the GUI
Message-ID: <48A94AD5.5010601@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone,

when using wxPython integration, if my GUI wants to send msgs, do I need 
to schedule the msg sending through the reactor like is needed when 
using non-reactor threads (see my post who's subject is "does 
setTcpNoDelay() not work?"), like :

    reactor.callFromThread(srv.sendMessage, "my msg")


or can I directly call it like :

    srv.sendMessage(my msg")

? I followed the wx integration tutorial on the Twisted homepage. I 
guess my question is more like : "Does the wxPython integration make it 
run in the reactor thread or not".

Thank you,
Gabriel

OK. This seems like a good approach. However, I am using twisted.web.server.Site as my factory and the resources tied to my Site instance are the ones that need to access the server configuration. How would I go about giving each request its own configuration reference in this case? I'm quite new to twisted and it's not entirely clear to me how to achieve this. :-)

You can do that, yes.

wxreactor makes wx run in same thread as Twisted, yes (at least from
your point of view).

Hello,

I'd like to get your opinion on using the D-Bus within a twisted
application. Would the Python D-Bus binding at

http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-python/doc/tutorial.html

work with twisted? is there a recommended approach?

Thank you,

Message-ID: <f33a4da20808190459g1b6cd1fav4ef720a7c526503f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I've written a small python/twisted client library for CouchDB.

It's mostly a toy, but it can be fetched from here:
http://www.cs.aau.dk/~htj/code/couched-0.1.tar.gz if anyone is interested.
License: MIT

I'm aware of paisley  (https://launchpad.net/paisley),
The main difference from paisley is that the connection and database
abstraction are separated.
Also couched does connection caching and uses web2 instead of web.
Currently paisley is more feature rich, but couched has slightly nicer error
handling.

Message-ID: <befee6d80808190508n7b0541c9ga2857cdbbf3b6e5a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

QUESTION 1 : callFromThread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I found this code snippet in twisted manual book.
But I don't quite get it.

What does "run 'notThreadSafe(3)' in the event loop" means?

Does the reactor promise that all those "notThreadSafe" functions
be called one by one so they won't interfere each other?

#======================================

from twisted.internet import reactor

def notThreadSafe(x):
    """do something that isn't thread-safe"""
    # ...

def threadSafeScheduler():
    """Run in thread-safe manner."""

reactor.callFromThread(notThreadSafe, 3) # will run 'notThreadSafe(3)' in
the event loop

#======================================


QUESTION 2 : Integrated with a threaded 3rd party library.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have a C library which using a work threaded pool model.  It's interface
is like this.

    void runWorkAsyn(int args, void pcallbackfunc(int));

When runWorkAsyn is called, it dispatch work to a thread in its
own thread pool and call 'pcallbackfunc' in that thread when it's done.

I really got confused by how use this lib from twisted in a thread safe way.
If I use a python callback function as pcallbackfunc and touch the reactor
from it,
it might damage the event look as most twisted APIs are not thread safe.

Yes, it works. All you have to do is make sure you use the glib2 or
gtk2 Twisted reactor, and then make sure you use the glib/gobject
event loop integration from dbus-python.

Sorry, I have one more thing to add:

I pray that you only have to use recent versions of dbus and
dbus-python. If you have to maintain compatibility with older versions
(like those shipped with Ubuntu 6.06 or 7.04), may God have mercy on
your soul.

Thanks for the advice. I will be using Ubuntu 8.04.1 as my development
platform with twisted 2.5. I hope this will be OK, or do I need to move
to the latest twisted 8.1?

They will be called in main thread, the one where you did reactor.run()

Rather than passing in callable "doSomething" as callback, pass in:
"lambda *args: reactor.callFromThread(doSomething, *args)".

There's nothing in Twisted 8 that will specifically help with dbus
integration, as far as I know, but there are a number of other
improvements that may be interesting to you for other reasons. I
suggest you check out the release news

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/tags/releases/twisted-8.1.0/NEWS%3Fformat%3Draw

That link contains release notes for 8.0 and 8.1, i.e., all changes since 2.5.

Thanks for your reply!  But I think I have to read some source code
 of twisted to make sure what was happening behind callFromThread.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] dont get ssl Server working
Message-ID: <945267974@web.de>

I tried to use ssl via twisted and I don't know why it doesn't work. If a client tries to connect ConnectionLost says:
[('SSL routines', 'SSL3_READ_BYTES', 'sslv3 alert bad certificate'), ('SSL routines', 'SSL3_READ_BYTES', 'ssl handshake failure')]

I tried different CAs, so there schould be no failure.
Do I have to do something else like SSL.Context(method).set_accept_state() manually?

My Code in basic looks like the following:
http://nopaste.info/8bd9bd8536.html

# class TLSProtocol(protocol.Protocol,  ssl.Server):
#  
#     def connectionLost(self, reason):
#         print "Connection Lost:"
#         print reason.getErrorMessage()
#  
#     def dataReceived(self, data):
#         print "Data Received: %s"%data
#  
#  
#  
# class Factory(protocol.ServerFactory):
#     protocol = TLSProtocol
#

Message-ID: <1db3ad0a0808210647i1e792b8bjeb2b32e8486c052f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I am trying to implement a multithreaded UDP server in Twisted:

from twisted.internet.protocol import DatagramProtocol
from twisted.internet import threads, reactor
from twisted.python import threadable
threadable.init(1)

reactor.suggestThreadPoolSize(32)

class EchoUDP(DatagramProtocol):

   def echoDatagram (self, datagram):
       print datagram

   def datagramReceived(self, datagram, address):
       self.transport.write(datagram, address)
       reactor.callInThread(self.echoDatagram(datagram))

def main():
   reactor.listenUDP(8000, EchoUDP())
   reactor.run()

if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()
although it is working it gives me following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):

Does anybody know what is wrong?

Any help is *greatly* appreciated! ;)

conchClient.py is libarary. Running it from the command line was an
afterthought just for testing.
To run multiple commands in the same session you just give sshCmds a
list of commands to run and it will return the output of all of them.
Here is an example script that creates a function to up a port and
another to return the wwn (this is from a SAN switch) of a port.

    # if change is False, the commands arn't suppose to do any damage

"cd" isn't a command that can be run - there's no /bin/cd or /usr/bin/cd
binary that you could call. It's a shell built-in, which means it's
available for shell-scripts to use, and it's available when you're using
the shell interactively, but that's it.

You're probably looking for os.chdir("./tempGitBranch")

Subject: [Twisted-Python] wxPython + Twisted = signals no longer caught
Message-ID: <48AE89F0.10004@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone,

I am writing a (Twisted) program that intercepts some signals using , 
such as Ctrl+C, and stops the reactor. I have a base class that sets-up 
signal handlers and it works great. The handlers are in my base factory 
class (we'll call it MyBaseFactory). Here's the code in the 
MyBaseFactory's __init__() :

    def __init__(self, proto, *args, **kwargs):
        self.protocol = proto
       
        if signal.getsignal(signal.SIGINT) == signal.default_int_handler:
            # only handle if there isn't already a handler, e.g. for Pdb.
            signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, self._sigHandler)
        signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, self._sigHandler)
       
        # Catch Ctrl-Break in windows
        if hasattr(signal, "SIGBREAK"):
            signal.signal(signal.SIGBREAK, self._sigHandler)

    def _sigHandler(self, signum, frame):
        if(signum == signal.SIGINT or signal.SIGTERM):
            reactor.callLater(0, reactor.stop)
        # Catch Ctrl-Break in windows
        elif hasattr(signal, "SIGBREAK") and signum == signal.SIGBREAK:
            reactor.callLater(0, reactor.stop)


I've recently had to integrate wxPython in parts of my application and 
I've inherited from MyBaseFactory and wx.App. When the Gui starts, it 
creates a wx.Dialog descendant/child that creates a wx.TaskBarIcon. I 
use the wxPython integration reactor code. Also, I have tried using 
wx.Frame instead of wx.Dialog but it doesn't change anything.

The interface works great, I can use twisted, I get and receive msgs, 
etc, but when I'm in the terminal were the program was run from, and I 
send SIGINT (Ctrl+C) nothing happens. Does anyone know why wxPython or 
Twisted eats my Ctrl+C in the terminal? This code (MyBaseFactory) works 
without the wxPython (I've been using it for several months).

Thank you,
Gabriel

PS I've also posted before to the wxPython mailing list without 
mentioning the twisted part, but apparently pure wxPython does not do 
this. I've also tested it (removed all the twisted stuff) and it does 
close when a SIGINT is sent.

Message-ID: <48AEC7B1.3040307@gmail.com>

I need someone to help me with twisted.web.

How can I do something (eg. redirect) once a users session has expired? 
At the point when the session expires your request is finished and your 
session is expired. I have added the notification callback but I can't 
really do anything inside it without a session to store information in 
or a request to redirect with, so I just print a message to the console.

Can anyone help me understand what I'm doing wrong here?

Thanks

I don't see how this would work, as HTTP is a stateless protocol.
Should by possible with AJAX, though (so, athena.livepage may be your
friend).

I can see where that would be a bit tricky.

The best idea I can think of is to have your top-level Resource check  
the session state in the locateChild method. If the session has  
expired, you can return a special Resource that simply redirects

Hi all,
when running msn_example.py
I get this:

2008/08/22 17:29 +0200 [-] Log opened.
2008/08/22 17:29 +0200 [-] Starting factory

1 or 2 months ago, it was working perfectly fine.

I suspect that something has changed on messenger.hotmail.com side

bonus: this two-week old bug (closed now) seems to be related and
claims to have a solution:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=493908

     [...] their response to the CVR command has changed [...]

Hopefully, it might be only that...
Thanks,

If you're trying to cause something to happen on the user's browser
when their session expires, as others have pointed out default HTTP is
stateless, so without something (like a bit of Javascript) running in
the user's browser staying in contact with your server behind the
scenes you won't be able to trigger any behavior on their end.

A user is likely to be already familiar with how most sites that have
active sessions won't tell them that their session is expired until
they initiate a subsequent request to the server (refresh a page, try
to click on a link, etc...).  Barring unique requirements for your
application, simply behaving that way - check the session for possible
expiration upon any subsequent request from that user and issue the
redirect then if expired - should be a fairly common behavior.


If you want to have something on the server end occur when the session
expires (say to update some internal state, or adjust or clear the
session information), then you can just establish a standard Twisted
callLater callback (which could itself be stored in the session and
reset when requests did come in), or if you may have lots of sessions,
have a separate server side object with a single periodic timer take
care of expiring sessions.  Or any other server side event that occurs
could be used to initiate session expiration processing.

done.
maybe is worth moving it to a higher priority since now the whole msn
code is useless while the fix seems not too hard.

most people ignore it but imvho twisted is the best network framework.
ever. impressive. thanks.

Guys,

MSNP8 has been deprecated at some point in time last July. And the MSN
dispatch server's response to a CVR has been changed causing this
loseConnection in the handle_VER to be called:

def handle_VER(self, params):
        versions = params[1:]
        if versions is None or ' '.join(versions) != MSNP_VER:
            self.transport.loseConnection()
        self.sendCommand('CVR %s %s %s' % (self.nextTID(), MSN_CVR_STR,
self.factory.userHandle))

twisted.words.msn has been written to close the session if the versions
doesn't match. This can be easily fixed correcting MSNP_VER variable
somewhere in the  twisted code (remove MSNP8 the current twisted 8.1 still
works with MSNP9).

I could submit a patch on wednesday after I go back from vacation. :)

Cheers,
Alvin Delagon

Hi,

We have a pretty big tests suite that uses trial to test all sorts of
twisted things.  We are pretty careful to do the right thing in our
tests and leave the reactor clean....but recently we began seeing a
transient really wierd bug when we run our test suite.

Some characteristics of the problem:

1.  The problem only appears sometimes - seems random
2.  The problem shows up in different test methods
3.  Sometimes it hangs the tests suite for a long time - eventually
twisted continues though

Here is the traceback we get.

line 220, in run
   self.mainLoop()
 File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/twisted/internet/posixbase.py",
line 228, in mainLoop
   self.runUntilCurrent()

 File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/twisted/internet/defer.py",
line 290, in _startRunCallbacks
   raise AlreadyCalledError
twisted.internet.defer.AlreadyCalledError:
ERROR

It appears that something is going on in the deadly _wait.  Any
thoughts on how we might fix this?

Thanks

Brian

I realize that this problem is difficult to track down, but I'm not sure 
what to tell you without more specific information about how your code 
is interacting with trial.

Is your code available somewhere?

Do you reliably see this error eventually if you use trial --until- 
failure?

Exactly what version of Twisted are you using?

What reactor do you typically run your tests under?

Not sure that I'd be able to tell you what's going on even with an 
answer to all of these questions, but they'd be a start :).

Thanks,
so out of curiosity , does Factory.buildProtocol() get called after 
PBClientFactory.clientConnectionMade(self,broker) ?
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/tags/releases/twisted-8.1.0/twisted/spread/pb.py#L1088

Is the broker parameter a reference to the class rather than an instance 
of Broker ?

No, buildProtocol gets called first.

Hello all,

Launchpad has recently released a Trac plugin that lets Launchpad
synchronize bugs and bug comments from Launchpad to Trac and vice
versa.

Can we please install this on our Trac?

Howdy, warthogs,

I'm writing to you to ask for help with testing some cool new features
that we're going to be adding to Launchpad shortly.

We've developed (well, we've contracted people to develop) plugins for
Bugzilla and Trac that allow bidirectional communication between
Launchpad and the remote bug trackers that have them installed.

As I said, we need some help testing these plugins. Specifically, we need to
have them installed on a number of remote bug trackers so that we can use the
plugins to communicate with those trackers.

If you know of any bug trackers whose administrators might be interested
in helping us out (or, even better, if you're one of those
administrators yourself),
please point them to the following pages on the help wiki, which will
explain how
to download and install the Launchpad plugins:

For Bugzilla: http://help.launchpad.net/Bugs/BugzillaPlugin
For Trac: http://help.launchpad.net/Bugs/TracPlugin

Installing one of the plugins means that:

 * Launchpad will be able to forward bugs to upstream bug trackers that
  have the plugin installed. Users of those bug trackers won't have to
  check Launchpad for bugs registered against their project; they'll be
  forwarded straight to the upstream tracker.

 * If a bug watch is created against an upstream bug, Launchpad will
  tell the upstream bug tracker which Launchpad bug is watching it.
  This means that not only is there a link in Launchpad to the upstream
  bug, but there's also a link in the upstream bug tracker to the
  Launchpad bug.

 * Launchpad will be able to import comments from upstream bugs which
  are being watched in Launchpad. If you register a bug watch against
  an upstream bug you'll be able to read the conversation about that
  bug on Launchpad, including the comments that are made on the
  upstream bug tracker.

 * Launchpad will be able to push comments to upstream bugs which are
  linked to a Launchpad bug, so if you add a comment on Launchpad in
  reply to a comment which was imported from an upstream bug tracker,
  the comment will automatically be added to the conversation on the
  upstream bug tracker, too. This means that users of both Launchpad
  and the upstream tracker can view the whole conversation about the
  bug without leaving their preferred environments.

If you've got any further questions, please feel free to ask me.

Thanks in advance for your help,

Graham

Hi there,

Anybody could tell me whether Ldaptor, which is build on top of twisted,
is still maintained or has been abandoned? Is it stable? I've found on
its home page it has not been updated in the last 3 years...

I'm starting a project (production system) in python which has to access
an Openldap server, so I'm in doubt what would be better to use by now,
ldaptor or python-ldap?

Best regards,

I got stuck when I got to the part of the installation which called for
the addition of the LAUNCHPAD_RPC permission to the launchpad user.  The
LAUNCHPAD_RPC permission isn't recognized and trac-admin refuses to add
it.

    Command failed: LAUNCHPAD_RPC is not a valid action.

Any suggestions?

Also, it seems like it might be a good idea to recommend on the installation
instructions page that the ability to register a new user named "launchpad"
be disabled before enabling this plugin.  Otherwise anyone can come along
and gain launchpad-level access to a tracker.

Alright, feel free to ignore that.  Purely an administrative error on my

I have a couple other questions, also.

What's with the "(Private)" bugs which show up on this page?

  https://launchpad.net/bugs/bugtrackers/twisted-bugs

Who controls the list of projects that show up in the "related projects"
box on that page?  What does it mean to be a "related project"?  Does it
mean bugs for those projects can get synchronized with the upstream bug
tracker, or is it just general information?

Hello,

I have a sample XMPP client with the following structure:

from twisted.words.protocols.jabber import client, jid
from twisted.internet import reactor
...
factory = client.basicClientFactory(myJid, myPasswd)
reactor.connectTCP(host,5222,factory)
reactor.run()

It works well, I can connect to the XMPP server. But I would appreciate
if some one could give me some hints on what's required to get the
client to connect using a secure SSL link. 

Thanks,

Subject: [Twisted-Python] RemoteReference decref
Message-ID: <48B697E6.3000302@gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm still working on an Actionscript pb client,

and have run into a bit of a conundrum with RemoteReference which is 
using python's built-in __del__  to trigger a decref.
Actionscript doesn't have destructors so I will need to trigger the 
decref manually.

based on my capture of a clent/server converation I am thinking that the 
client could do this in proto_answer

s -:  ('version', 6)
r -:  ['version', 6]
r -:  ['message', 1, 'root', 'login', 1, ['tuple', 'alice'], ['dictionary']]
s -:  ('answer', 1, ['tuple', 
'x\x9b\x95\x1c\tJp\xe0\x96]\xf4\xdb\xeb\x13\t9', ('remote', 1)])
r -:  ['message', 2, 1, 'respond', 1, ['tuple', 
'\x06\x04\xf1vI\xfeP\xa0\xdfzl(\xd9\x7f!t', ['remote', 1]], ['dictionary']]
s -:  ('answer', 2, ('remote', 2))
r -:  ['decref', 1]
r -:  ['message', 3, 2, 'joinGroup', 1, ['tuple', '#lookingForFourth'], 
['dictionary']]
s -:  ('answer', 3, ('remote', 3))
r -:  ['decref', 2]
r -:  ['message', 4, 3, 'send', 1, ['tuple', 'You can call me Al.'], 
['dictionary']]
s -:  ('message', 1, 1, 'print', 1, ['tuple', '<alice> says: You can 
call me Al.'], ['dictionary'])
s -:  ('answer', 4, ['None'])
r -:  ['decref', 3]

Not sure where I get a reference to RemoteReference though.
any ideas ?

This doesn't sound like it makes sense.  You should only decref when the
object is no longer in use.  If you can't do it from a destructor, then
you have to require application code to do it.  The protocol implementation
can't know when the application has finished using the object.

The protocol capture shows decrefs after answers purely by coincidence.  If
the application code being run to generate this kept references to the
objects longer, then you wouldn't see this pattern.

The (ECONNABORTED) suggests that this error originated in the OS and was 
only propagated by Python and Twisted. Which OS are you using?

The documentation of the C accept() call might help. On my Linux system "man 
2 accept" just says "ECONNABORTED: A connection has been aborted." 
though. :(

How many simultaneous clients connected on your server? By default, linux is
configured to have 1024 file descriptors pre process. You may have to set
your ulimit higher.

This means that a client started to connect to your server but then
quickly aborted the attempt.  The server saw the attempt but before
it could accept the new connection, the client had abandoned it.
Assuming other clients are successfully connecting to your server,
you can safely ignore this.

Encountering a ulimit on open files will result in EMFILE rather than
ECONNABORTED.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Monitoring configuration of twisted calls.
Message-ID: <575469.72443.qm@web33703.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I'm fairly new to twisted, although we are using it in production. What I'd like to do, is have a simple redlight/greenlight method (over XML-RPC) to tell me which methods have been called successfully at least once. The goal of this is not so much performance or uptime, but to just tell me that we are configured correctly.

We're using twisted as a sort of service bus, so we have a decent amount of configuration that needs to be set up.

What I've considered so far:

1. Modifying each xmlrpc method individually and setting a boolean to True in a dictionary:

       if results:
            self._monitor['xmlrpc.method.name'] = True

This is okay, but I'd like something that is more generic so I don't have to write this code in every single XMLRPC method.

2. Extending/subclassing XMLRPC: 

    def _getFunction(self, functionPath):
        '''
        Overrides XMLRPC._getFunction to use our simple mapper.
        '''
        
        ## attempt default behavior for local methods
        try:
            func = XMLRPC._getFunction(self, functionPath)
            return func
        except NoSuchFunction:
            pass

This would work in my head, but in actuality, the call doesn't actually happen here, it just returns the function.

3. Extending/subclassing QueryProtocol:

    def handleStatus(self, version, status, message):
        if status != '200':
            self.factory.badStatus(status, message)

I could override QueryProtocol and in the handleStatus method set a field in a dictionary.

There are probably many ways to do this wrong, and I'm a Java guy just getting used to the twisted way of doing things. I apologize if my attempts are painful and/or hilarious.

Thanks,
Steve L.

This is probably the best approach.  `_getFunction? should probably be a
public method.  Its docstring directs users to override it, which is rather
in conflict with it being private.

To overcome the problem of the function not actually being called inside
`_getFunction?, you just need to apply a wrapper to the function which is
looked up.  The wrapper can mark the call as successful.  For example:

    def _getFunction(self, functionPath):
        f = XMLRPC._getFunction(self, functionPath)
        def wrapper(*a, **kw):
            result = f(*a, **kw)
            self._monitor[functionPath] = True
            return result
        return wrapper

I'd also recommend filing a ticket to make `_getFunction? public, so that
you don't have to rely on a private hook to make this work.

Okay, that seems to work. One more question:

We've defined a class called XMLRPCWithRemote that subclasses XMLRPC. Some of the methods are local, others with be called using the Proxy. I tried to wrap the function but I'm getting:

exceptions.AttributeError: Deferred instance has no __call__ method


This is the code I have for wrapping:

              def wrapper(*args, **kw):
                        func = self._getProxy(URL["url"], URL["user"], URL["passwd"]).callRemote(remote_method, *args, **kw)
                        result = func(*args, **kw)
                        monitor[functionPath] = True
                                                
                        return result
                        
                    return wrapper

_getProxy is defined thusly:

    def _getProxy(self, url, username=None, password=None):
        log.msg("Get proxy")
        return Proxy(url, user=username, password=password, allowNone=True, useDateTime=True)


So it looks like I'm getting a deferred back from the callRemote, so it appears harder to wrap? I think that's what's going on. I'm guessing the local method doesn't require a deferred, so that's why it works.

Is there something obvious I'm missing? I started going down the path of overriding xmlrpc.Proxy or xmlrpc._QueryFactory but I'm not sure that's the simplest way.

Thanks a bunch,
Steve

The wrapper I gave as an example doesn't handle Deferreds, indeed.  Have
you worked with Deferreds before?  If not, you may want to read some of
the documentation about them, eg:

 http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/defer.html

That aside, I don't really understand the modifications you've made.  It
seems that you're doing an XML-RPC call to get a function object to call
to produce a result to give to the XML-RPC client which made a call on to
you.  Since XML-RPC calls can't result in functions, I don't understand
this.

Actually, I think I just figured it out:

                    def wrapper(*args, **kw):
                        func = self._getProxy(URL["url"], URL["user"], URL["passwd"]).callRemote(remote_method, *args, **kw)
                        
                        func.addCallback(self.handleSuccess, method)
                                                
                        return func
                        
                    return wrapper

All I needed was to add a callback!

yes, the code is the IPython mainline, on launchpad:

$ bzr branch lp:ipython

Then, simply

$ trial IPython

Will show the problem.  You will also need foolcap to run the test suite.

It shows up as an Error rather than a Failure.  But yes, it still shows up.

You can try running with trial --debug (possibly also --nopm).  This will
cause Deferred debugging to be enabled, which will cause the call site of
each Deferred's creation to be saved.  Then you can inspect this to learn
which Deferred is being called back multiple times.  Once you learn this,
further debugging approaches may become apparent (like looking at all the
call sites which can call back a Deferred created there, and figuring out
how more than one of them can be executed).

Thanks for your replies.

I don't think I have reached the limit of 1024 connections. Other
clients are connecting successfully to
the server, so, I think I should ignore this error as Jean-Paul suggests.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Processes in Twisted,
	only possible to run external prog?
Message-ID: <48B7BC33.7090501@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone,

Here's the problem : I need to run a windows executable (proprietary, 
they won't give us the code) with wine to do some audio compression. I 
need to do different processing before (like calling sox, or parsing 
files, etc) so I wrote some functions that do everything. The windows 
exec creates a tmp file named "_tmp" in the working dir, so if I want to 
run several in parallel, I have to create a tmp dir with a unique name 
and change the working dir, if not then the multiple executions will 
overwrite each other's tmp file. So when I call my function that does 
the whole process, I first create a tmp dir, then pass it the tmp dir 
and the input filename, then once inside the function, it does an 
os.chDir() into the tmp dir and at the end it does it again to go back 
to the original current dir. Then I run that function in threads. The 
problem is that threads share the current dir :

http://www.biais.org/blog/index.php/2007/01/23/19-python-threads-and-oschdir 

http://bugs.python.org/issue1367

so I need to use processes instead, as they each have their own current 
dir. The thing is that from what I understand, Twisted's process API is 
intended to be used with external executables only, correct? I wasn' t 
able to fins anything that allowed me to do stuff like I would using 
fork(). Should I just use python's fock() instead? Is it safe with Twisted?

Thank you,
Gabriel

Maybe you could bypass this problem by generating a short shell script that 
does "cd" before it starts Wine? Since the shell will be a separate 
process, it has its own working dir.

I'd rather not, because that would mean implementing everything (the 
whole conversion process) in the script.
I have stuff to do before the conversion,preparations, those could be 
done in the script, and after : parsing output,
filter and modify the data & then write the new data in binary form -- 
which is harder to do from a non-python shell script.

Maybe I could use a standalone python shell script? Is there no other 
solution?

Gabriel

Do the other processing steps also require the working directory to be 
changed? Most unix programs work fine from any dir as long as you provide 
absolute paths for the input and output files.

Maarten,

It worked, I was able to do the pre & post processing using abs paths 
(thus from outside of the working dir)
and the encoding was done from a script that changed the working directory.

Thank you,

As it happens, "python" is an "external executable".  Here's an example 
of spawning it in such a way as to make sure that sys.path is set 
properly: 
http://divmod.org/trac/browser/trunk/Epsilon/epsilon/process.py#L7

However, Wine is also an external process.  Perhaps you just want to 
spawn the Wine command-line using spawnProcess using the 'path' 
parameter set to a directory that you have created in the main process, 
then clean it up when the process exits?

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.1.0/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorProcess.spawnProcess.html

Using fork() in Python has a lot of confusing issues associated with it 
unless you're going to exec() immediately afterwards.  You probably want 
to stick to one of these other approaches.

You also need to do some other stuff before you call fork(), like close
file descriptors and disable garbage collection.  And then re-enable it
in the parent after the fork().  There's probably even some more things
that are necessary that no one has realized yet.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] How does the pollreactor work?
Message-ID: <069B6B31F6201B4389D7EEB9AD827BCA05005AF9@otis.burlington.evertz.tv>

Hi, there.

I have been trying to figure out how to use the twisted.internet.pollreactor so that I can use it to monitor a Linux named PIPE (i.e. a FIFO created using mkfifo()).  I tried without success to Google some examples but I couldn't find anything.

Now, for a simple TCP server, the setup looks something like this (i.e. like the QOTD example in the documentation):

	from twisted.internet.protocol import Protocol, Factory
	from twisted.internet import reactor
	
	class QOTD(Protocol):
	
	    def connectionMade(self):
	        self.transport.write("An apple a day keeps the doctor away\r\n") 
	        self.transport.loseConnection()
	
	# Next lines are magic:
	factory = Factory()
	factory.protocol = QOTD
	
	# 8007 is the port you want to run under. Choose something >1024
	reactor.listenTCP(8007, factory)
	reactor.run()

So, the TCP type of reactor has something that tells it to listen to port 8007 and use some form of factory or object to take care of things when a connection occurs.  As far as I can guess, I would need to do some steps like this (NOTE: using mixture of real and pseudo code):

	from twisted.internet import pollreactor
	pollreactor.install()

	<create a FileDescriptor object using /tmp/myfifo, maybe a class?>
	<use the reactor.addReader() call to register the FileDescriptor object with the reactor>
	<call reactor.run() (no loop) or call reactor.doPoll() (in a loop, processing returned events)?>

Anyways, if anyone can give me some direction on how this reactor works.  Ideally, I would assume that the relationships would be somewhat like this:

	Protocol analogous to FileDescriptor
	reactor.listenTCP analogous to reactor.addReader()
	reactor.run() would invoke the appropriate call in my FileDescriptor-based class to handle any read events on /tmp/myfifo

Thanks in advance.

Thanks I didn't quite understand what decref was for.
I thought it might be the cause of another problem I was having.
but it's not a major problem - decref will just have to be triggered 
manually in an AS client.

I have a tendency to just jump in at the deep end and hope I can figure 
things out  .. .
so I really appreciate the help.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Controlling logging in xmlrpc server
Message-ID: <g99759$6ab$1@ger.gmane.org>

I have an XMLRPC server running nicely, and have set up logging to a 
file using t.p.log (mainly for debugging).  It all works fine, but I'm 
getting entries in the log like the following:

2008/08/28 16:44 -0700 [HTTPChannel,0,127.0.0.1] 127.0.0.1 - - 
[28/Aug/2008:23:44:02 +0000] "POST / HTTP/1.1" 200 683 "-" 
"Zend_XmlRpc_Client"

(all one line -- excuse the folding).

I'd like to be able to control this: disable these log messages when I 
want, log additional information about the request, etc.  (In 
particular, I'd like to see the xmlrpc "method" name.)

I've tracked down the source of the messages to HTTPFactory.log in 
t.w.http.py.  At this point, I'm not sure how to proceed.  I don't use 
the factory explicitly, just instantiate a subclass of xmlrpc.XMLRPC, 
wrap it in a server.Site and pass it to the default reactor.  What would 
I need to do to access the HTTPFactory (or maybe subclass it) in this 
context?  Is there a better approach to this?

Thanks,

This doesn't really have anything to do with pollreactor.  Any reactor 
that implements IReactorFDSet can monitor a pipe.

It was easier for me to implement this than to explain what to do, so 
here's the code for monitoring a named pipe for read, given its name. 
I'm pretty sure it's not 100% correct, but if you want to read about 
handling I/O events from fifos on your platform, you are welcome to do 
so.

    import os
    from twisted.internet.abstract import FileDescriptor
    from twisted.internet.main import CONNECTION_DONE

    class FIFODescriptor(FileDescriptor):
        def __init__(self, reactor, fifoname, protocol):
            FileDescriptor.__init__(self, reactor)
            self.fifo = os.open(fifoname, os.O_NONBLOCK | os.O_RDONLY)
            self.protocol = protocol
            self.protocol.makeConnection(self)

        def connectionLost(self, reason):
            self.protocol.connectionLost(reason)

        def doRead(self):
            data = os.read(self.fifo, 1024)
            if data:
                self.protocol.dataReceived(data)
            else:
                self.stopReading()
                self.connectionLost(CONNECTION_DONE)

        def fileno(self):
            return self.fifo


And here's a brief program that uses it:

    import sys
    from twisted.internet import reactor
    from twisted.internet.protocol import Protocol
    class PrintingProtocol(Protocol):
        def dataReceived(self, data):
            print 'data', repr(data)
        def connectionMade(self):
            print 'hi'
        def connectionLost(self, reason):
            print 'bye', reason
    fifd = FIFODescriptor(reactor, sys.argv[1], PrintingProtocol())
    fifd.startReading()
    reactor.run()

I tested this by doing 'mkfifo x; python fifo.py x', and in another 
terminal, 'cat > x'.  It should be pretty self-explanitory.

Thanks, but this does not fix it. The deprecation warning is:

/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/twisted/conch/ssh/userauth.py:376: DeprecationWarning: signData is deprecated since Twisted Conch 0.9.  Use Key(obj).sign(data).
  return keys.signData(privateKey, signData)

I still get this warning even if I change my code to remove ".keyObject"
but authentication no longer works if I do that. It looks like this is
actually a bug in my copy of userauth.py (although it is not a serious
problem - just a deprecation warning). I could get around the
problem by reimplementing the signData method in SSHUserAuthClient.
I am using version 8.1.0 as distributed by Debian, i.e.
http://packages.debian.org/lenny/python-twisted-conch

Hi, the correct thing to do is to write a unittest for it (in [1]) and a
patch and attach it to a ticket on the Twisted website.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] HTTP interface to a program using twisted
Message-ID: <4896B43A.9060700@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone,

I have a program using twisted and I'd like it to obtain it's data via 
the HTTP protocol. The idea is that the clients will connect to a 
service using HTTP and will send it data encapsulated in the HTTP. The 
data will be extracted and sent on to another service to process  it, 
which will in turn send the processed data back to the HTTP service to 
send back to the client. I think twisted.web and/or twisted.web2 should 
be used for this, is that correct? I don't quite get the difference in 
between web/web2, could someone please enlighten me? I have read the 
documentation but it doesn't say much.

Thank you,
Gabriel Rossetti

Use twisted.web - twisted.web2 will have all its good bits stolen and 
put into .web, then be (I guess) deprecated:

  http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedWebPlan

Can someone with access re-add this prominent link to the twistedmatrix 
front page?

Ok, but I just want to make sure first it's better to use twisted.web 
rather than implementing my own protocol, since I won't be serving any 
web pages and to me it seams twisted.web is designed to serve web content.

No. twisted.web is a general HTTP server. You can use it to implement 
XMLRPC, JSON-RPC or various other non-HTML HTTP applications, as well as 
HTML pages.

Hello All,

For some strange reason I this text is being added to the end of the html
pages rendered by twisted.
Request did not return a string

Request:

<GET /config/deleteSection HTTP/1.1>


Resource:

<configPages.deleteSection instance at 0x00EC4EE0>


Value:

None

I am using the resource.Resource and render. My html is passed has a string
using request.write.
As far has I can tell, there should not be a problem. Does anyone know why
and what I need to do to fix this.

Hello All,

I have written a small twisted application that I am trying to access over
http.
I have successfully created a tap file using mktap, but I still cannot
access the
application using http. Does anyone know how this is done ?

Python functions implicitly return None if there is no return statement.

Twisted.web wants the render method to either return a string, or the 
special object NOT_DONE_YET, which indicates that the reply will be written 
with request.write(). The name was probably chosen for cases where the 
content is written using deferreds, but it should be used even if you call 
request.write() from the render method.

So try putting "return server.NOT_DONE_YET" at the end of your render 
method.

Bye,
		Maarten

If you do need to do any of your own protocol work, surely it would be 
easier to write a few patches for twisted.web than to do the whole thing 
over again :).

If you did

    mktap foo bar baz

to make your tap file, instead do

    twistd foo bar baz

to start the server with your desired configuration rather than 
outputting a tap file.

Tap files are not a really good mechanism for dealing with configuration 
and are being slowly phased out in favor of running twistd plugins 
directly.

Message-ID: <7947f7250808050443r7751aa9dh296862ae3a959b5c@mail.gmail.com>

I want to create a server in twisted that has a permanent variable which i
want to use as the number of request requested to the server. When i use
that for Protocol, each time the variable is created newly.

Then i used
*class Echo(Protocol):
    def dataReceived(self, data):

        if "data" not in dir(self.factory):
            self.factory.data = 0
        self.factory.data = self.factory.data + 1

        """As soon as any data is received, write it back."""
        self.transport.write(data + str(self.factory.data))


but i want to remove the code that is:

**        if "data" not in dir(self.factory):
            self.factory.data = 0
        self.factory.data = self.factory.data + 1


How to do that?

Hi JP

I think Squzer meant that he'd like to put the initialization code elsewhere.

Squzer, why not do the initialization of self.factory.data when the factory
is created, and then increment the variable each time a connection is made?
Is that what you meant?

Will request.finish have the same effect as return server.NOT_DONE_YET ?
Or do the statements do different things ?

You have to use both: call request.finish() when you are done writing and 
return NOT_DONE_YET from the render method.

(forwarding for Daniel who had some list posting trouble)

Hi all-
I'd like to use Twisted to manage bluetooth communication. I haven't
found any existing method for doing this, so I'd like to write and
implement a new reactor interface (on par with TCP/UDP) that wraps the
lightblue library. What's the right way to go about extending Twisted in
this way?
Thanks,
Daniel

A lot of reactors implement `IReactorFDSet´:

  http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorFDSet.html

If you don't mind that some reactors don't implement this, you can
use it to implement bluetooth support.

If you get stuck, and list doesn't help, show up to next Twisted sprint
and maybe one of us can help.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Jython reactor - a proposal
Message-ID: <1qwea36yndtit.ci6snfvp7paz.dlg@40tude.net>

Hello everybody,
I recently took a look at the current Jython status, and it seems to me
that the latest alpha provides a good compatibility towards the standard
CPython. 

I'd really like running jython+twisted, so when I realized there was no
reactor available for such platform I took some time to analyze the issue:

- An old-and-incomplete java reactor existed in Twisted 1.3 which used
java.io.
- java.nio would be a better choice to implement such a reactor since java
1.4
- a wrapper around java.nio called EIO existed (
http://java.twistedmatrix.com/eio/ ) but there seems no way to take a peek
at it since there's no file that can be accessed beyond its home page
(every single link is broken :-( )
- a kind of async networking library called Apache Mina is avaiable for
java, and it makes use of java.nio
- other java-reactor pattern implementations are available around (e.g.
assorted on sourceforge ).

So, it seems java.nio is the right way to go and there's quite a lot of
code around to look at. Since I'd like to code a java reactory, I've got
some questions:
- any other clue? Is there anything else I should look at before starting
my code?
- is there any way I could be given commit access to a private branch on
twisted svn repository? i could set up a repo elsewhere, but this would
make synchronization and merging a bit more painful and slow.
- is there any other similar project ongoing by anyone else?

Thanks!

Hi list,

I'm currently in the process of hacking together TIPC[1] support for Twisted. 
I've got reliable datagram support in a "works for me" state now.

Is anyone interested to see this in Twisted? Thought I'd rather ask here 
before opening a ticket etc.

Alan Franzoni was kind enough to say:

[cut]

I just discovered jython provides the select module as well (I wouldn't
ever think of that), I'm performing some tests with that before going on
with a brand-new reactor.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] foolscap copyable and constraint
Message-ID: <20080809090217.GA8379@lemurdoc>

ciao! i'm playing a bit with foolscap and i try to use RemoteInterface
to describe my constraint but i cannot understand how to use it with
pass-by-copy. this is a small example:


    from foolscap import RemoteInterface, registerCopier, \
            registerRemoteCopyFactory

    class Label:
        def __init__(self, text):
            self.text = text


    def copyLabel(label):
        return ('_Label', {'text': label.text})

    registerCopier(Label, copyLabel)

    def makeLabel(state):
        label = Label(state['text'])
        return label

    registerRemoteCopyFactory('_Label', makeLabel)


    class RITest(RemoteInterface):
        def getLabel():
            return Label


but what i get is:
foolscap.tokens.UnknownSchemaType: can't make constraint from
'__main__.Label' (<type 'classobj'>)

which is the correct way to define a constraint for a third party-class?

Yes, the regular Twisted sprints are held in Cambridge, MA.

Shall we have another one soon? I'm available outside of September 6-20.

Well my schedule should definitely not carry much weight since I am 
totally new to this, bet here goes:
Not available - From now till Sept 2nd, and weekend of Sept 13th. 
Otherwise - will do my best to make it and drag one or two others with me.
(Oh, and I AM located in Cambridge, MA)

Hello List,

I'm trying to use AsynQueue for queuing requests for a synchronous
protocol (emi/ucp). Is it possible to return a deferred from the queued
method so the next method in the queue is only called after the deferred
from the first was fired? Or is there a better way to handle synchronous
protocols where i have to wait for an answer of a message sent over the
wire before i can send another one?

Thanks,

Stephan

Just use a single implementer of IWorker that only accepts one 
assignment at a time. The queue will not feed it its next task until the 
deferred from its previous one has fired.

What you're trying to do is exactly what AsynQueue is for. For example, 
my sAsync package uses AsynQueue to feed database queries to the SQLite 
database engine one at a time in a single thread.

If you have multiple connections that each can handle successive 
requests successively, but independently the other connection, you can 
simply use an IWorker implementer for each one. (I don't know that 
emi/ucp has any way of doing this.) Then the queue will feed requests to 
whoever is ready, one at a time.

I use this for running jobs asynchronously over a cluster of CPU nodes. 
The queue gets fed thousands of tasks nearly at once, and parcels them 
out one at a time to each node. Some CPU nodes run faster than others, 
and the queueing makes that all work out fine.

Please note that there is also a very simple and elegant queue object in 
twisted.internet.defer that might meet your needs without the complexity 
(and capability) of AsynQueue.

Feel free to contact me offline if you have additional questions on this.

Hello,

I'm needing to send small packets to update a progress bar. My update 
msgs were all being sent in big packets, so I tried setting 
setTcpNoDelay() in connectionMade() but it doesn't change anything, is 
it broken?

Thank you,
Gabriel

I an using code that I wrote using threads.deferToThread(), I wondered 
if it was blocking the reactor maybe, so I tried just using a plain 
deferToThread() call. Here's the code (without all the protocol stuff, 
it's executed when data come in.

    def loop(self):
        import time
        m = utils.createMessage("toto", "hello")
        while(True):
            print "Sending %s" % m.toXml()
            self.sendMessage(m)
            print "Sent!"
            time.sleep(2)


threads.deferToThread(self.loop)

the TCP no delay option is turned on like I said before, the weird thing 
is that I have the same thing, all my msgs get sent in big blocks. 
Either the TCP no delay doesn't work, or the reactor is getting tied up. 
I don' t get it since I'm running the blocking code in a thread, the 
reactor should have nothing to do.

Thank you,
Gabriel

P.S.
I know that I'm not returning a deferred, I am in my real code though, 
but this is just "debug" code.

Since you didn't include the definition of `sendMessage´, it's hard to say
what's really going on here.  However, my guess is that you're calling the
transport.write method in a non-reactor thread, which is not allowed.

If this isn't the case, including a full, minimal example in your next
message would be a good idea. :)

Yes, self.sendMessage() calls transport.write. So there's no way of 
sending msgs from a non-reactor thread, even if it has a reference to 
the protocol?

There is a way.  The way is to use reactor.callFromThread to schedule a
function to be called in the reactor thread.

eg, reactor.callFromThread(self.sendMessage)

use reactor.callFromThread, which takes as an argument a function to
call in the reactor thread. That function can use Twisted APIs like
transport.write. Most Twisted APIs are not thread-safe, and cannot be
called from a non-reactor thread.

My memory is a bit fuzzy, but I think Copyables aren't as mature as they
ought to be, and we don't yet have a way to express a constraint that allows
a Copyable as an argument. When I hit a need for this in Tahoe, I punted and
used an Any() (which just allows anything through).

There's a foolscap.copyable.AttributeDictConstraint, which can be used to
control what gets to go into the Copyable (store an instance of it in the
.stateSchema attribute of your RemoteCopy class, or provide it as the
stateSchema= argument to registerRemoteCopyFactory.. see
foolscap/test/test_copyable.py MyRemoteCopy4 for an example). It might be
used something like this (untested):

 label_constraint = copyable.AttributeDictConstraint( ("text", str) )
 registerRemoteCopyFactory("_Label", makeLabel, label_constraint)

But that doesn't get you the next-higher-level part.

>     class RITest(RemoteInterface):
>         def getLabel():
>             return Label

That's the desired syntax for this sort of constraint, but it doesn't work
yet. We could fix that.. the approach would be:

 1: create a CopyableConstraint class, inheriting from constraint.Constraint,
    and created with a Copyable subclass (or maybe a RemoteCopy subclass)
    1a: implement CopyableConstraint.checkObject(), somehow. If inbound=False
        then it should probably assert an isinstance(obj, myCopyableClass).
        If inbound=True, it should probably check against myRemoteCopyClass
        instead. checkObject() is used outbound before serialization, and
        inbound post-deserialization; i.e. it examines fully-formed objects
        rather than individual tokens.
 2: add code to schema.adapt_obj_to_iconstraint() (or register an adapter)
    that knows how to create a CopyableConstraint from a Copyable or
    RemoteCopy class.

There is a small design issue.. should the constraint reference the Copyable,
or the RemoteCopy? I.e. should your getLabel() interface method say "return
Label" or "return RemoteLabel"? It depends upon how you want to read the
RemoteInterface.. from the point of view of the sender, or that of the
receiver. My casual thought is to use the Copyable.

This makes more difference in constraints that specify pass-by-proxy objects:

 class RIRow(RemoteInterface):
   def get_value(): return int

 class RIDatabase(RemoteInterface)
   def get_row(rownum=int): return RIRow

where the question is: does the get_row() method return a Referenceable
(which gets turned into a RemoteReference by the time it gets to the remote
caller), or are we saying that it has to return a RemoteReference that is
hosted on the caller's side (such that it gets turned back into a local
Referenceable byt the time it gets to that caller). The former is a lot more
useful, but there might be situations where you want to express the latter,
so it would be nice if there were a syntax for it.

I don't remember if there is such a syntax right now, but my point is that
this sort of distinction doesn't show up with pass-by-copy objects like
Copyable. The caller always receives a RemoteCopy of some sort.


hope that helps,
 -Brian

Thank you Jean-Paul & Christopher, I hadn't realized that. Now I 
understand better why in deferToThread() you use 
reactor.callFromThread() to add callbacks/errbacks. So if I understand, 
anything that uses twisted, that I'd need to call from a thread, needs 
to be called with reactor.callFromThread().

Would something like this be ok?

from zope.interface import implements

class DeferredWorker(object):

        d.addCallbacks(task.callback, task.errback)

Hello!

Is there any way I can make twisted stop accepting connections for a short period of time and then start accepting connections? Something like reactor.pause()?

More precisely, what I want to do is to reread my server configuration on SIGHUP (or some other external event). If possible I would like to do this without locking a mutex when accessing (reading or modifying) the configuration info. I figure that reconfiguring the server will be a rare event. So if there is some way that I can:

1. Block incoming requests. Preferable keeping them in the connection queue.
2. Wait for all running requests to complete.
3. Reread the server configuration.
4. Unblock incoming requests. 

What do you think? Is there some simple twisted-way to do this?

If this has been covered in the past, please point me in that direction. :-)

Regards,
Mattias

Subject: [Twisted-Python] twisted python conch SSH shell?
Message-ID: <74a0fd5f0808121340pdf0e46egd4dfb9b1c10cbaf4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been playing around with Twisted's Conch client (which looks extremely
well done, thanks!). I've been able to connect to a conch server and also
connect to other ssh servers and execuate various commands. I'd like to be
able to connect to an arbitrary SSH server and run /bin/bash.

I'm able to execute a command like so:

---------------------
class CommandChannel(channel.SSHChannel):
    ....
    def channelOpen(self, data):
        self.conn.sendRequest(
            self, 'exec', common.NS(self.command),
wantReply=True).addCallback(
            self._gotResponse)
---------------------

Looking through the SSH spec (connect protocol, rfc4254), it looks like
shells are opened with this command.

---------------------

      byte      SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST
      uint32    recipient channel
      string    "shell"
      boolean   want reply

---------------------

It doesn't look like Conch supports these requests (here's how
CHANNEL_REQUESTs are currently sent out)

---------------------
(Twisted-8.1.0)
twisted/conch/ssh/connection.py (413):
        self.transport.sendPacket(MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST, struct.pack('>L',
                                    self.channelsToRemoteChannel[channel])
                                  + common.NS(requestType)+chr(wantReply)
                                  + data)
---------------------

I may be misunderstanding how remote shells are started, so any help would
be appreciated.

Again, I'm trying to launch an interactive /bin/bash shell from a Conch SSH
client on an arbitrary remote SSH server.

Thanks for your time.

Best Regards,
Bill Zeller

Nice comparison.  A more idiomatic rendering of the "raw deferred"
example might look like this, though:

  def lookup(country, search_term):
      query = "http://www.google.%s/search?q=%s" % (country,search_term)
      d = getPage(query)
      def cbFirstPage(content, country):
          m = re.search('<div id="?res.*?href="(?P<url>http://[^"]+)"',
                        content, re.DOTALL)
          if not m:
              return None
          url = m.group('url')
          d = getPage(url)
          def cbSecondPage(content, country, url):
              m = re.search("<title>(.*?)</title>", content)
              if m:
                  title = m.group(1)
                  return dict(url = url, title = title)
              else:
                  return dict(url=url, title="<not-specified>")
          d.addCallback(cbSecondPage, country, url)
          return d
      d.addCallback(cbGotPage, country)
      def ebGeneric(err, country):
          print ".%s FAILED: %s" % (country, str(e))
      d.addErrback(ebGeneric, country)
      return d

Converting any failure into a print and a None result is a bit strange,
but it's the same thing your other two examples did so I preserved that
behavior.

Hmm, I'd be glad to add this to the article in a way or another,
would you mind it?

(btw, I find my "raw" example more readable, but this is likely a
matter of taste...)

Just wanted to do something illustrating error handling

Thanks for writing this up!  It always makes me happy to see the 
ecosystem around Twisted developing, people blogging about stuff like 
this.  Makes it feel like a real project.

Of course it would make it feel even more like a real project if you 
could be convinced to contribute to the official documentation :). 
There's no mention of inlineCallbacks in the official documentation (the 
stuff in doc/) at all, and it would be helpful to have at least an 
overview.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] HTTP CONNECT support
Message-ID: <41beb4dc0808140426g42c45025y2f75a0d41d0ae373@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I posted the following to the web mailing list but on second thoughts
I think that it's kinda a problem with my understanding of the other
parts of the framework, so I'm reposting it here. I'd appreciate any
pointers. It's a bit lengthy, so apologies for that.



I'm looking into adding HTTPS support to the proxy module for some
testing I'm doing. I'd like to be able to trap requests and responses
as they go to and from the server, so proper CONNECT support is not
really what I'm aiming for. I've come up with the following:

"""
from twisted.web import proxy, http
from twisted.internet import reactor, ssl
from twisted.python import log
import sys
import urlparse

from OpenSSL import SSL as OSSL

class MyProxyClient(proxy.ProxyClient):

   def handleEndHeaders(self):
       print "THOSE HEADERS DONE ENDED"
       self.father.transport.write("\r\n")

   def handleResponsePart(self, buffer):
       print "GOT SOME STUFF TO SEND TO THE BROWSER"
       self.father.transport.write(buffer)

   def dataReceived(self, data):
       print "To the Browser"
       print data # Data sent to the browser
       proxy.ProxyClient.dataReceived(self, data)

   def handleResponseEnd(self):
       print "losing connection..."
       self.transport.loseConnection()
       self.father.channel.transport.loseConnection()


class MyProxyClientFactory(proxy.ProxyClientFactory):
   def buildProtocol(self, addr):
       client = proxy.ProxyClientFactory.buildProtocol(self, addr)
       client.__class__ = MyProxyClient
       return client

class MySSLContext(ssl.ContextFactory):
   def getContext(self):
       ctx = OSSL.Context(OSSL.SSLv23_METHOD)
       ctx.use_certificate_file('server.cert')
       ctx.use_privatekey_file('server.pkey')
       return ctx

class MyProxyRequest(proxy.ProxyRequest):
   protocols = {
           'http': MyProxyClientFactory,
           'https': MyProxyClientFactory
           }
   ports = {
           'http': 80,
           'https': 443
           }

   def requestDone(self, request):
       """Called by first request in queue when it is done."""
       print "REQUESTDONE DONE BE CALLED"
       if request != self.requests[0]: raise TypeError
       del self.requests[0]

       if self.persistent:
           # notify next request it can start writing
           if self.requests:
               self.requests[0].noLongerQueued()
           else:
               if self._savedTimeOut:
                   self.setTimeout(self._savedTimeOut)
       else:
           print "lOSING CONNECTION"
           self.transport.loseConnection()

   def process(self):
       parsed = urlparse.urlparse(self.uri)
       protocol = parsed.scheme
       host = parsed.hostname
       doSSL = False
       if self.method.upper() == "CONNECT":
           self.transport.write("HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established\r\n\r\n")
           self.transport.startTLS(MySSLContext())
           protocol = "https"
           self.host = parsed.scheme
           print "finished connect request"
       else:
           if self.isSecure():
               headers = self.getAllHeaders().copy()
               host = headers["host"]
               protocol = "https"
               doSSL = True
           port = self.ports[protocol]
           if ':' in host:
               host, port = host.split(':')
               port = int(port)
           rest = urlparse.urlunparse(('', '') + parsed[2:])
           if not rest:
               rest = rest + '/'
           class_ = self.protocols[protocol]
           headers = self.getAllHeaders().copy()
           if 'host' not in headers:
               headers['host'] = host
           self.content.seek(0, 0)
           s = self.content.read()
           clientFactory = class_(self.method, rest, self.clientproto, headers,
                           s, self)

           else:
               print "Connecting to SSL"
               self.reactor.connectSSL(host, port, clientFactory,

class MyProxy(proxy.Proxy):
   def dataReceived(self, data):
       print "To the Server"
       print data # Data sent to the server
       proxy.Proxy.dataReceived(self, data)

   def requestFactory(self, *args):
       return MyProxyRequest(*args)

class ProxyFactory(http.HTTPFactory):
       protocol = MyProxy

reactor.listenTCP(8081, ProxyFactory())
log.startLogging(sys.stdout) # Log to the console
reactor.run()
"""

Most of the magic is happening in the 'process' method. I've copied
some of the other methods in for debugging. At the moment it's a bit
hackish but it's almost working as expected. When a connect request is
received then the SSL connection is set up as required (using
transport.startTLS). This generates certificate mismatch errors in the
browser, but this is expected and is what I'm looking for as then I can read the
requests as they come through.
The GET request is then received from the browser and forwarded on to the
server. The server appears to be happy with this as it does pass the
appropriate response back to the proxy. For some reason, however, the
browser does not then get passed the response. Comparing identical
requests for the HTTP and HTTPS versions of a site show that the only
apparent difference is that the headers and body are sent in one go
under HTTP and as two separate chunks under HTTPS.

E.g. HTTPS:

The HTTPS version seems to have an extra line feed being added after
the headers, which may be causing the problem. I've tried stripping
this out but then I get some other exception being thrown and HTTP
traffic stops working.

I've got a feeling that I'm not quite going about this in the correct
way but I'd appreciate any help or insights that anyone could offer.
If you need any more details then please ask.

Many thanks in advance,

Felix

It's really necesary do that?

1 Your app have a reference to a object whith the loaded config
2 A defered take a reference to these object
3 A reread event change the app config reference to new loaded config
object. Old defered no change his reference and end whith old config.
4 New defereds take new config and reference that.
5 When old config object have not references is garbaged collected.

No blocking operation is nedded if you can load 2 configuration
objects in memory (the old one for connections in progress and the new
one).

Excuse my poor english.

Javi

I recently discovered elisa. A media center implemented with twisted python.
Elisa have a bluetoth plugin than use py-bluez (other bt library). The
code is here:

http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~elisa-developers/elisa/upicek/annotate/11.5.55?filter_file_id=bluetooth_input.py-20080401102113-vcj3p4systzzapcn-411&file_id=bluetooth_input.py-20080401102113-vcj3p4systzzapcn-411

I don't know if it is useful for you.

My Twisted server is listening on two ports: 80 for processing http
requrests and xxx for
processing tcp requests from clients.

http logs seem to clutter my log file. Is there any way to disable
http logs only and leave
logging facility otherwise intact? Or at least redirect http logs to a
different file?

Thanks in advance.

Hello all,
I try to implement a custom ssh server with twisted . I use* sshserver.py to
begin (* http://www.devshed.com/c/a/Python/SSH-with-Twisted/ )
I would like to execute interactive scripts which are on my server. The
problem is theses scripts are interactives. How can I redirect IO on my
shell ?
For example, if I want to install a software with apt. I have questions to
install dependencies ( yes/no)
I start to create a definition for this function like def do_apt. And then
when in my custom shell I execute ( apt python)., that executes apt-get
install python on the server. But how can I redirect the output in my shell
to answer dependencies questions ?
Thanks for your help

If you pass a filename for the `logPath´ parameter to `Site´, request
logs will be written to that file instead of to the main log.

To run a program like apt, you must be using `reactor.spawnProcess´.  That
means that you have two different protocol implementations.  One to talk
to the SSH connection (eg, `SSHDemoProtocol´ in the O'Reilly example) and
one to talk to the child process.

If you want output from the child process to show up in the SSH client, then
when the process protocol receives data from it, it should pass it on to the
SSH protocol to write to the client.  Similarly, if you want input from the
SSH client written to the stdin of the child process, when the SSH protocol
receives data it should pass it on to the process protocol to write to the
child process.

You'll have to keep track of what state your application is in to do this
correctly.  Input should only be handled this way when there is actually
a child process running.

Hi all,

In my opinion, I like twisted very much but my coworkers are all quite
unfamiliar with Python.  And also we are afraid of source code leak problem.

So, can you remember some similar framework in C/C++ world?

Understandable, but it might be worthwhile to learn.  Python can be a 
much more productive language than C++.
>And also we are afraid of source code leak problem.

If your users are savvy enough to extract Python source code from a 
trivially obfuscated executable, they are probably savvy enough to 
extract the information they want by decompiling your C++ binaries too. 
There are a lot of people who are really very skilled at this.  You 
should not assume that just because you are using C or C++, your source 
code is safe.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] wxPython integration & msg sending from the GUI
Message-ID: <48A94AD5.5010601@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone,

when using wxPython integration, if my GUI wants to send msgs, do I need 
to schedule the msg sending through the reactor like is needed when 
using non-reactor threads (see my post who's subject is "does 
setTcpNoDelay() not work?"), like :

    reactor.callFromThread(srv.sendMessage, "my msg")


or can I directly call it like :

    srv.sendMessage(my msg")

? I followed the wx integration tutorial on the Twisted homepage. I 
guess my question is more like : "Does the wxPython integration make it 
run in the reactor thread or not".

Thank you,
Gabriel

OK. This seems like a good approach. However, I am using twisted.web.server.Site as my factory and the resources tied to my Site instance are the ones that need to access the server configuration. How would I go about giving each request its own configuration reference in this case? I'm quite new to twisted and it's not entirely clear to me how to achieve this. :-)

wxreactor makes wx run in same thread as Twisted, yes (at least from
your point of view).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Couched 0.1: CouchDB twisted client
Message-ID: <f33a4da20808190459g1b6cd1fav4ef720a7c526503f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I've written a small python/twisted client library for CouchDB.

It's mostly a toy, but it can be fetched from here:
http://www.cs.aau.dk/~htj/code/couched-0.1.tar.gz if anyone is interested.
License: MIT

I'm aware of paisley  (https://launchpad.net/paisley),
The main difference from paisley is that the connection and database
abstraction are separated.
Also couched does connection caching and uses web2 instead of web.
Currently paisley is more feature rich, but couched has slightly nicer error
handling.

Message-ID: <befee6d80808190508n7b0541c9ga2857cdbbf3b6e5a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

QUESTION 1 : callFromThread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I found this code snippet in twisted manual book.
But I don't quite get it.

What does "run 'notThreadSafe(3)' in the event loop" means?

Does the reactor promise that all those "notThreadSafe" functions
be called one by one so they won't interfere each other?

#======================================

from twisted.internet import reactor

def notThreadSafe(x):
    """do something that isn't thread-safe"""
    # ...

def threadSafeScheduler():
    """Run in thread-safe manner."""

reactor.callFromThread(notThreadSafe, 3) # will run 'notThreadSafe(3)' in
the event loop

#======================================


QUESTION 2 : Integrated with a threaded 3rd party library.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have a C library which using a work threaded pool model.  It's interface
is like this.

    void runWorkAsyn(int args, void pcallbackfunc(int));

When runWorkAsyn is called, it dispatch work to a thread in its
own thread pool and call 'pcallbackfunc' in that thread when it's done.

I really got confused by how use this lib from twisted in a thread safe way.
If I use a python callback function as pcallbackfunc and touch the reactor
from it,
it might damage the event look as most twisted APIs are not thread safe.

Yes, it works. All you have to do is make sure you use the glib2 or
gtk2 Twisted reactor, and then make sure you use the glib/gobject
event loop integration from dbus-python.

Sorry, I have one more thing to add:

I pray that you only have to use recent versions of dbus and
dbus-python. If you have to maintain compatibility with older versions
(like those shipped with Ubuntu 6.06 or 7.04), may God have mercy on
your soul.

Thanks for the advice. I will be using Ubuntu 8.04.1 as my development
platform with twisted 2.5. I hope this will be OK, or do I need to move
to the latest twisted 8.1?

They will be called in main thread, the one where you did reactor.run()

Rather than passing in callable "doSomething" as callback, pass in:
"lambda *args: reactor.callFromThread(doSomething, *args)".

There's nothing in Twisted 8 that will specifically help with dbus
integration, as far as I know, but there are a number of other
improvements that may be interesting to you for other reasons. I
suggest you check out the release news

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/tags/releases/twisted-8.1.0/NEWS%3Fformat%3Draw

That link contains release notes for 8.0 and 8.1, i.e., all changes since 2.5.

Thanks for your reply!  But I think I have to read some source code
 of twisted to make sure what was happening behind callFromThread.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] dont get ssl Server working
Message-ID: <945267974@web.de>

I tried to use ssl via twisted and I don't know why it doesn't work. If a client tries to connect ConnectionLost says:
[('SSL routines', 'SSL3_READ_BYTES', 'sslv3 alert bad certificate'), ('SSL routines', 'SSL3_READ_BYTES', 'ssl handshake failure')]

I tried different CAs, so there schould be no failure.
Do I have to do something else like SSL.Context(method).set_accept_state() manually?

My Code in basic looks like the following:
http://nopaste.info/8bd9bd8536.html

# class TLSProtocol(protocol.Protocol,  ssl.Server):
#  
#     def connectionLost(self, reason):
#         print "Connection Lost:"
#         print reason.getErrorMessage()
#  
#     def dataReceived(self, data):
#         print "Data Received: %s"%data
#  
#  
#  
# class Factory(protocol.ServerFactory):
#     protocol = TLSProtocol
#  
#     def buildProtocol(self,  addr):
#         p = self.protocol()
#         return p
#    
#     def clientConnectionLost(self, transport, reason):
#         print "Connection Lost: %s"%reason.getErrorMessage()
#         reactor.stop( )
#        
#     def clientConnectionFailed(self, transport, reason):
#         print "connection Failed: %s"%reason.getErrorMessage( )
#         reactor.stop( )
#  
#  
#  
# class ContextFactory(ssl.ContextFactory):
#  
#     def __init__(self):
#         sslmethod = SSL.TLSv1_METHOD
#  
#         ctx = SSL.Context(sslmethod)
#         ctx.use_certificate_file('ssl.crt')
#         ctx.use_privatekey_file('ssl.key')
#        
#         self._context = ctx
#  
#     def getContext(self):
#         "Create an SSL context"
#  
#         return self._context
#  
#  
#  
# reactor.listenSSL(8601,  Factory(), ContextFactory())

Don't inherit your class from ssl.Server, for starters.

Message-ID: <1db3ad0a0808210647i1e792b8bjeb2b32e8486c052f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I am trying to implement a multithreaded UDP server in Twisted:

from twisted.internet.protocol import DatagramProtocol
from twisted.internet import threads, reactor
from twisted.python import threadable
threadable.init(1)

reactor.suggestThreadPoolSize(32)

class EchoUDP(DatagramProtocol):

   def echoDatagram (self, datagram):
       print datagram

   def datagramReceived(self, datagram, address):
       self.transport.write(datagram, address)
       reactor.callInThread(self.echoDatagram(datagram))

def main():
   reactor.listenUDP(8000, EchoUDP())
   reactor.run()

if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()
although it is working it gives me following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "C:\Python25\lib\threading.py", line 460, in __bootstrap

Does anybody know what is wrong?

Any help is *greatly* appreciated! ;)

conchClient.py is libarary. Running it from the command line was an
afterthought just for testing.
To run multiple commands in the same session you just give sshCmds a
list of commands to run and it will return the output of all of them.
Here is an example script that creates a function to up a port and
another to return the wwn (this is from a SAN switch) of a port.

"cd" isn't a command that can be run - there's no /bin/cd or /usr/bin/cd
binary that you could call. It's a shell built-in, which means it's
available for shell-scripts to use, and it's available when you're using
the shell interactively, but that's it.

You're probably looking for os.chdir("./tempGitBranch")

Subject: [Twisted-Python] wxPython + Twisted = signals no longer caught
Message-ID: <48AE89F0.10004@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone,

I am writing a (Twisted) program that intercepts some signals using , 
such as Ctrl+C, and stops the reactor. I have a base class that sets-up 
signal handlers and it works great. The handlers are in my base factory 
class (we'll call it MyBaseFactory). Here's the code in the 
MyBaseFactory's __init__() :

    def __init__(self, proto, *args, **kwargs):
        self.protocol = proto
       
        if signal.getsignal(signal.SIGINT) == signal.default_int_handler:
            # only handle if there isn't already a handler, e.g. for Pdb.
            signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, self._sigHandler)
        signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, self._sigHandler)
       
        # Catch Ctrl-Break in windows
        if hasattr(signal, "SIGBREAK"):
            signal.signal(signal.SIGBREAK, self._sigHandler)

    def _sigHandler(self, signum, frame):
        if(signum == signal.SIGINT or signal.SIGTERM):
            reactor.callLater(0, reactor.stop)
        # Catch Ctrl-Break in windows
        elif hasattr(signal, "SIGBREAK") and signum == signal.SIGBREAK:
            reactor.callLater(0, reactor.stop)


I've recently had to integrate wxPython in parts of my application and 
I've inherited from MyBaseFactory and wx.App. When the Gui starts, it 
creates a wx.Dialog descendant/child that creates a wx.TaskBarIcon. I 
use the wxPython integration reactor code. Also, I have tried using 
wx.Frame instead of wx.Dialog but it doesn't change anything.

The interface works great, I can use twisted, I get and receive msgs, 
etc, but when I'm in the terminal were the program was run from, and I 
send SIGINT (Ctrl+C) nothing happens. Does anyone know why wxPython or 
Twisted eats my Ctrl+C in the terminal? This code (MyBaseFactory) works 
without the wxPython (I've been using it for several months).

Thank you,
Gabriel

PS I've also posted before to the wxPython mailing list without 
mentioning the twisted part, but apparently pure wxPython does not do 
this. I've also tested it (removed all the twisted stuff) and it does 
close when a SIGINT is sent.

Message-ID: <48AEC7B1.3040307@gmail.com>

I need someone to help me with twisted.web.

How can I do something (eg. redirect) once a users session has expired? 
At the point when the session expires your request is finished and your 
session is expired. I have added the notification callback but I can't 
really do anything inside it without a session to store information in 
or a request to redirect with, so I just print a message to the console.

Can anyone help me understand what I'm doing wrong here?

Thanks

I don't see how this would work, as HTTP is a stateless protocol.
Should by possible with AJAX, though (so, athena.livepage may be your
friend).

I can see where that would be a bit tricky.

The best idea I can think of is to have your top-level Resource check  
the session state in the locateChild method. If the session has  
expired, you can return a special Resource that simply redirects  
immediately.

If you're trying to cause something to happen on the user's browser
when their session expires, as others have pointed out default HTTP is
stateless, so without something (like a bit of Javascript) running in
the user's browser staying in contact with your server behind the
scenes you won't be able to trigger any behavior on their end.

A user is likely to be already familiar with how most sites that have
active sessions won't tell them that their session is expired until
they initiate a subsequent request to the server (refresh a page, try
to click on a link, etc...).  Barring unique requirements for your
application, simply behaving that way - check the session for possible
expiration upon any subsequent request from that user and issue the
redirect then if expired - should be a fairly common behavior.


If you want to have something on the server end occur when the session
expires (say to update some internal state, or adjust or clear the
session information), then you can just establish a standard Twisted
callLater callback (which could itself be stored in the session and
reset when requests did come in), or if you may have lots of sessions,
have a separate server side object with a single periodic timer take
care of expiring sessions.  Or any other server side event that occurs
could be used to initiate session expiration processing.

done.
maybe is worth moving it to a higher priority since now the whole msn
code is useless while the fix seems not too hard.

most people ignore it but imvho twisted is the best network framework.
ever. impressive. thanks.

Guys,

MSNP8 has been deprecated at some point in time last July. And the MSN
dispatch server's response to a CVR has been changed causing this
loseConnection in the handle_VER to be called:

def handle_VER(self, params):
        versions = params[1:]
        if versions is None or ' '.join(versions) != MSNP_VER:
            self.transport.loseConnection()
        self.sendCommand('CVR %s %s %s' % (self.nextTID(), MSN_CVR_STR,
self.factory.userHandle))

twisted.words.msn has been written to close the session if the versions
doesn't match. This can be easily fixed correcting MSNP_VER variable
somewhere in the  twisted code (remove MSNP8 the current twisted 8.1 still
works with MSNP9).

I could submit a patch on wednesday after I go back from vacation. :)

Cheers,
Alvin Delagon

Hi,

We have a pretty big tests suite that uses trial to test all sorts of
twisted things.  We are pretty careful to do the right thing in our
tests and leave the reactor clean....but recently we began seeing a
transient really wierd bug when we run our test suite.

Some characteristics of the problem:

1.  The problem only appears sometimes - seems random
2.  The problem shows up in different test methods
3.  Sometimes it hangs the tests suite for a long time - eventually
twisted continues though

Here is the traceback we get.

line 220, in run
   self.mainLoop()
 File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/twisted/internet/posixbase.py",
line 228, in mainLoop
   self.runUntilCurrent()

 File "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/twisted/internet/defer.py",
line 290, in _startRunCallbacks
   raise AlreadyCalledError
twisted.internet.defer.AlreadyCalledError:
ERROR

It appears that something is going on in the deadly _wait.  Any
thoughts on how we might fix this?

Thanks

Brian

I realize that this problem is difficult to track down, but I'm not sure 
what to tell you without more specific information about how your code 
is interacting with trial.

Is your code available somewhere?

Do you reliably see this error eventually if you use trial --until- 
failure?

Exactly what version of Twisted are you using?

What reactor do you typically run your tests under?

Not sure that I'd be able to tell you what's going on even with an 
answer to all of these questions, but they'd be a start :).

Thanks,
so out of curiosity , does Factory.buildProtocol() get called after 
PBClientFactory.clientConnectionMade(self,broker) ?
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/tags/releases/twisted-8.1.0/twisted/spread/pb.py#L1088

Is the broker parameter a reference to the class rather than an instance 
of Broker ?

No, buildProtocol gets called first.

The `broker´ parameter is an instance of `Broker´.

Message-ID: <d06a5cd30808261819wdc57aa0t6256eb01136c8def@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

Launchpad has recently released a Trac plugin that lets Launchpad
synchronize bugs and bug comments from Launchpad to Trac and vice
versa.

Can we please install this on our Trac?

Subject: Bugzilla and Trac Launchpad plugins: Request for beta testers
To: Warthogs list <warthogs at lists.canonical.com>


Howdy, warthogs,

I'm writing to you to ask for help with testing some cool new features
that we're going to be adding to Launchpad shortly.

We've developed (well, we've contracted people to develop) plugins for
Bugzilla and Trac that allow bidirectional communication between
Launchpad and the remote bug trackers that have them installed.

As I said, we need some help testing these plugins. Specifically, we need to
have them installed on a number of remote bug trackers so that we can use the
plugins to communicate with those trackers.

If you know of any bug trackers whose administrators might be interested
in helping us out (or, even better, if you're one of those
administrators yourself),
please point them to the following pages on the help wiki, which will
explain how
to download and install the Launchpad plugins:

For Bugzilla: http://help.launchpad.net/Bugs/BugzillaPlugin
For Trac: http://help.launchpad.net/Bugs/TracPlugin

Installing one of the plugins means that:

 * Launchpad will be able to forward bugs to upstream bug trackers that
  have the plugin installed. Users of those bug trackers won't have to
  check Launchpad for bugs registered against their project; they'll be

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Is  Ldaptor stable / still maintained?
Message-ID: <48B54529.5070000@inf.ufrgs.br>

Hi there,

Anybody could tell me whether Ldaptor, which is build on top of twisted,
is still maintained or has been abandoned? Is it stable? I've found on
its home page it has not been updated in the last 3 years...

I'm starting a project (production system) in python which has to access
an Openldap server, so I'm in doubt what would be better to use by now,
ldaptor or python-ldap?

Best regards,

         Luciano

I got stuck when I got to the part of the installation which called for
the addition of the LAUNCHPAD_RPC permission to the launchpad user.  The
LAUNCHPAD_RPC permission isn't recognized and trac-admin refuses to add
it.

    Command failed: LAUNCHPAD_RPC is not a valid action.

Any suggestions?

Also, it seems like it might be a good idea to recommend on the installation
instructions page that the ability to register a new user named "launchpad"
be disabled before enabling this plugin.  Otherwise anyone can come along
and gain launchpad-level access to a tracker.

Alright, feel free to ignore that.  Purely an administrative error on my

I have a couple other questions, also.

What's with the "(Private)" bugs which show up on this page?

  https://launchpad.net/bugs/bugtrackers/twisted-bugs

Who controls the list of projects that show up in the "related projects"
box on that page?  What does it mean to be a "related project"?  Does it
mean bugs for those projects can get synchronized with the upstream bug
tracker, or is it just general information?

Hello,

I have a sample XMPP client with the following structure:

from twisted.words.protocols.jabber import client, jid
from twisted.internet import reactor
...
factory = client.basicClientFactory(myJid, myPasswd)
reactor.connectTCP(host,5222,factory)
reactor.run()

It works well, I can connect to the XMPP server. But I would appreciate
if some one could give me some hints on what's required to get the
client to connect using a secure SSL link. 

Thanks,

Subject: [Twisted-Python] RemoteReference decref
Message-ID: <48B697E6.3000302@gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm still working on an Actionscript pb client,

and have run into a bit of a conundrum with RemoteReference which is 
using python's built-in __del__  to trigger a decref.
Actionscript doesn't have destructors so I will need to trigger the 
decref manually.

based on my capture of a clent/server converation I am thinking that the 
client could do this in proto_answer

s -:  ('version', 6)
r -:  ['version', 6]
r -:  ['message', 1, 'root', 'login', 1, ['tuple', 'alice'], ['dictionary']]
s -:  ('answer', 1, ['tuple', 
'x\x9b\x95\x1c\tJp\xe0\x96]\xf4\xdb\xeb\x13\t9', ('remote', 1)])
r -:  ['message', 2, 1, 'respond', 1, ['tuple', 
'\x06\x04\xf1vI\xfeP\xa0\xdfzl(\xd9\x7f!t', ['remote', 1]], ['dictionary']]
s -:  ('answer', 2, ('remote', 2))
r -:  ['decref', 1]
r -:  ['message', 3, 2, 'joinGroup', 1, ['tuple', '#lookingForFourth'], 
['dictionary']]
s -:  ('answer', 3, ('remote', 3))
r -:  ['decref', 2]
r -:  ['message', 4, 3, 'send', 1, ['tuple', 'You can call me Al.'], 
['dictionary']]
s -:  ('message', 1, 1, 'print', 1, ['tuple', '<alice> says: You can 
call me Al.'], ['dictionary'])
s -:  ('answer', 4, ['None'])
r -:  ['decref', 3]

Not sure where I get a reference to RemoteReference though.
any ideas ?

This doesn't sound like it makes sense.  You should only decref when the
object is no longer in use.  If you can't do it from a destructor, then
you have to require application code to do it.  The protocol implementation
can't know when the application has finished using the object.

The protocol capture shows decrefs after answers purely by coincidence.  If
the application code being run to generate this kept references to the
objects longer, then you wouldn't see this pattern.

The (ECONNABORTED) suggests that this error originated in the OS and was 
only propagated by Python and Twisted. Which OS are you using?

The documentation of the C accept() call might help. On my Linux system "man 
2 accept" just says "ECONNABORTED: A connection has been aborted." 
though. :(

How many simultaneous clients connected on your server? By default, linux is
configured to have 1024 file descriptors pre process. You may have to set
your ulimit higher.

This means that a client started to connect to your server but then
quickly aborted the attempt.  The server saw the attempt but before
it could accept the new connection, the client had abandoned it.
Assuming other clients are successfully connecting to your server,
you can safely ignore this.

Encountering a ulimit on open files will result in EMFILE rather than
ECONNABORTED.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Monitoring configuration of twisted calls.
Message-ID: <575469.72443.qm@web33703.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I'm fairly new to twisted, although we are using it in production. What I'd like to do, is have a simple redlight/greenlight method (over XML-RPC) to tell me which methods have been called successfully at least once. The goal of this is not so much performance or uptime, but to just tell me that we are configured correctly.

We're using twisted as a sort of service bus, so we have a decent amount of configuration that needs to be set up.

What I've considered so far:

1. Modifying each xmlrpc method individually and setting a boolean to True in a dictionary:

       if results:
            self._monitor['xmlrpc.method.name'] = True

This is okay, but I'd like something that is more generic so I don't have to write this code in every single XMLRPC method.

2. Extending/subclassing XMLRPC: 

    def _getFunction(self, functionPath):
        '''
        Overrides XMLRPC._getFunction to use our simple mapper.
        '''
        
        ## attempt default behavior for local methods
        try:
            func = XMLRPC._getFunction(self, functionPath)
            return func
        except NoSuchFunction:
            pass

This would work in my head, but in actuality, the call doesn't actually happen here, it just returns the function.

3. Extending/subclassing QueryProtocol:

    def handleStatus(self, version, status, message):
        if status != '200':
            self.factory.badStatus(status, message)

I could override QueryProtocol and in the handleStatus method set a field in a dictionary.

There are probably many ways to do this wrong, and I'm a Java guy just getting used to the twisted way of doing things. I apologize if my attempts are painful and/or hilarious.

Thanks,
Steve L.

This is probably the best approach.  `_getFunction´ should probably be a
public method.  Its docstring directs users to override it, which is rather
in conflict with it being private.

To overcome the problem of the function not actually being called inside
`_getFunction´, you just need to apply a wrapper to the function which is
looked up.  The wrapper can mark the call as successful.  For example:

    def _getFunction(self, functionPath):
        f = XMLRPC._getFunction(self, functionPath)
        def wrapper(*a, **kw):
            result = f(*a, **kw)
            self._monitor[functionPath] = True
            return result
        return wrapper

I'd also recommend filing a ticket to make `_getFunction´ public, so that
you don't have to rely on a private hook to make this work.

Okay, that seems to work. One more question:

We've defined a class called XMLRPCWithRemote that subclasses XMLRPC. Some of the methods are local, others with be called using the Proxy. I tried to wrap the function but I'm getting:

exceptions.AttributeError: Deferred instance has no __call__ method


This is the code I have for wrapping:

              def wrapper(*args, **kw):
                        func = self._getProxy(URL["url"], URL["user"], URL["passwd"]).callRemote(remote_method, *args, **kw)
                        result = func(*args, **kw)
                        monitor[functionPath] = True
                                                
                        return result
                        
                    return wrapper

_getProxy is defined thusly:

    def _getProxy(self, url, username=None, password=None):
        log.msg("Get proxy")
        return Proxy(url, user=username, password=password, allowNone=True, useDateTime=True)


So it looks like I'm getting a deferred back from the callRemote, so it appears harder to wrap? I think that's what's going on. I'm guessing the local method doesn't require a deferred, so that's why it works.

Is there something obvious I'm missing? I started going down the path of overriding xmlrpc.Proxy or xmlrpc._QueryFactory but I'm not sure that's the simplest way.

Thanks a bunch,
Steve

This is probably the best approach.  `_getFunction´ should probably be a
public method.  Its docstring directs users to override it, which is rather
in conflict with it being private.

To overcome the problem of the function not actually being called inside
`_getFunction´, you just need to apply a wrapper to the function which is
looked up.  The wrapper can mark the call as successful.  For example:

    def _getFunction(self, functionPath):
        f = XMLRPC._getFunction(self, functionPath)
        def wrapper(*a, **kw):
            result = f(*a, **kw)
            self._monitor[functionPath] = True
            return result
        return wrapper

I'd also recommend filing a ticket to make `_getFunction´ public, so that
you don't have to rely on a private hook to make this work.

The wrapper I gave as an example doesn't handle Deferreds, indeed.  Have
you worked with Deferreds before?  If not, you may want to read some of
the documentation about them, eg:

 http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/defer.html

That aside, I don't really understand the modifications you've made.  It
seems that you're doing an XML-RPC call to get a function object to call
to produce a result to give to the XML-RPC client which made a call on to
you.  Since XML-RPC calls can't result in functions, I don't understand
this.

Actually, I think I just figured it out:

                    def wrapper(*args, **kw):
                        func = self._getProxy(URL["url"], URL["user"], URL["passwd"]).callRemote(remote_method, *args, **kw)
                        
                        func.addCallback(self.handleSuccess, method)
                                                
                        return func
                        
                    return wrapper

All I needed was to add a callback!

yes, the code is the IPython mainline, on launchpad:

Then, simply

It shows up as an Error rather than a Failure.  But yes, it still shows up.

You can try running with trial --debug (possibly also --nopm).  This will
cause Deferred debugging to be enabled, which will cause the call site of
each Deferred's creation to be saved.  Then you can inspect this to learn
which Deferred is being called back multiple times.  Once you learn this,
further debugging approaches may become apparent (like looking at all the
call sites which can call back a Deferred created there, and figuring out
how more than one of them can be executed).

Thanks for your replies.

I don't think I have reached the limit of 1024 connections. Other
clients are connecting successfully to
the server, so, I think I should ignore this error as Jean-Paul suggests.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Processes in Twisted,
	only possible to run external prog?
Message-ID: <48B7BC33.7090501@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone,

Here's the problem : I need to run a windows executable (proprietary, 
they won't give us the code) with wine to do some audio compression. I 
need to do different processing before (like calling sox, or parsing 
files, etc) so I wrote some functions that do everything. The windows 
exec creates a tmp file named "_tmp" in the working dir, so if I want to 
run several in parallel, I have to create a tmp dir with a unique name 
and change the working dir, if not then the multiple executions will 
overwrite each other's tmp file. So when I call my function that does 
the whole process, I first create a tmp dir, then pass it the tmp dir 
and the input filename, then once inside the function, it does an 
os.chDir() into the tmp dir and at the end it does it again to go back 
to the original current dir. Then I run that function in threads. The 
problem is that threads share the current dir :

http://www.biais.org/blog/index.php/2007/01/23/19-python-threads-and-oschdir 

http://bugs.python.org/issue1367

so I need to use processes instead, as they each have their own current 
dir. The thing is that from what I understand, Twisted's process API is 
intended to be used with external executables only, correct? I wasn' t 
able to fins anything that allowed me to do stuff like I would using 
fork(). Should I just use python's fock() instead? Is it safe with Twisted?

Thank you,
Gabriel

Maybe you could bypass this problem by generating a short shell script that 
does "cd" before it starts Wine? Since the shell will be a separate 
process, it has its own working dir.

I'd rather not, because that would mean implementing everything (the 
whole conversion process) in the script.
I have stuff to do before the conversion,preparations, those could be 
done in the script, and after : parsing output,
filter and modify the data & then write the new data in binary form -- 
which is harder to do from a non-python shell script.

Maybe I could use a standalone python shell script? Is there no other 
solution?

Gabriel

Do the other processing steps also require the working directory to be 
changed? Most unix programs work fine from any dir as long as you provide 
absolute paths for the input and output files.

Hmmm, good question, let me investigate that, I'll keep you updated.

Maarten,

It worked, I was able to do the pre & post processing using abs paths 
(thus from outside of the working dir)
and the encoding was done from a script that changed the working directory.

Thank you,
Gabriel

As it happens, "python" is an "external executable".  Here's an example 
of spawning it in such a way as to make sure that sys.path is set 
properly: 
http://divmod.org/trac/browser/trunk/Epsilon/epsilon/process.py#L7

However, Wine is also an external process.  Perhaps you just want to 
spawn the Wine command-line using spawnProcess using the 'path' 
parameter set to a directory that you have created in the main process, 
then clean it up when the process exits?

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.1.0/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorProcess.spawnProcess.html

Using fork() in Python has a lot of confusing issues associated with it 
unless you're going to exec() immediately afterwards.  You probably want 
to stick to one of these other approaches.

You also need to do some other stuff before you call fork(), like close
file descriptors and disable garbage collection.  And then re-enable it
in the parent after the fork().  There's probably even some more things
that are necessary that no one has realized yet.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] How does the pollreactor work?
Message-ID: <069B6B31F6201B4389D7EEB9AD827BCA05005AF9@otis.burlington.evertz.tv>

Hi, there.

I have been trying to figure out how to use the twisted.internet.pollreactor so that I can use it to monitor a Linux named PIPE (i.e. a FIFO created using mkfifo()).  I tried without success to Google some examples but I couldn't find anything.

Now, for a simple TCP server, the setup looks something like this (i.e. like the QOTD example in the documentation):

	from twisted.internet.protocol import Protocol, Factory
	from twisted.internet import reactor
	
	class QOTD(Protocol):
	
	    def connectionMade(self):
	        self.transport.write("An apple a day keeps the doctor away\r\n") 
	        self.transport.loseConnection()
	
	# Next lines are magic:
	factory = Factory()
	factory.protocol = QOTD
	
	# 8007 is the port you want to run under. Choose something >1024
	reactor.listenTCP(8007, factory)
	reactor.run()

So, the TCP type of reactor has something that tells it to listen to port 8007 and use some form of factory or object to take care of things when a connection occurs.  As far as I can guess, I would need to do some steps like this (NOTE: using mixture of real and pseudo code):

	from twisted.internet import pollreactor
	pollreactor.install()

	<create a FileDescriptor object using /tmp/myfifo, maybe a class?>
	<use the reactor.addReader() call to register the FileDescriptor object with the reactor>
	<call reactor.run() (no loop) or call reactor.doPoll() (in a loop, processing returned events)?>

Anyways, if anyone can give me some direction on how this reactor works.  Ideally, I would assume that the relationships would be somewhat like this:

	Protocol analogous to FileDescriptor
	reactor.listenTCP analogous to reactor.addReader()
	reactor.run() would invoke the appropriate call in my FileDescriptor-based class to handle any read events on /tmp/myfifo

Thanks in advance.

Thanks I didn't quite understand what decref was for.
I thought it might be the cause of another problem I was having.
but it's not a major problem - decref will just have to be triggered 
manually in an AS client.

I have a tendency to just jump in at the deep end and hope I can figure 
things out  .. .
so I really appreciate the help.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Controlling logging in xmlrpc server
Message-ID: <g99759$6ab$1@ger.gmane.org>

I have an XMLRPC server running nicely, and have set up logging to a 
file using t.p.log (mainly for debugging).  It all works fine, but I'm 
getting entries in the log like the following:

2008/08/28 16:44 -0700 [HTTPChannel,0,127.0.0.1] 127.0.0.1 - - 
[28/Aug/2008:23:44:02 +0000] "POST / HTTP/1.1" 200 683 "-" 
"Zend_XmlRpc_Client"

(all one line -- excuse the folding).

I'd like to be able to control this: disable these log messages when I 
want, log additional information about the request, etc.  (In 
particular, I'd like to see the xmlrpc "method" name.)

I've tracked down the source of the messages to HTTPFactory.log in 
t.w.http.py.  At this point, I'm not sure how to proceed.  I don't use 
the factory explicitly, just instantiate a subclass of xmlrpc.XMLRPC, 
wrap it in a server.Site and pass it to the default reactor.  What would 
I need to do to access the HTTPFactory (or maybe subclass it) in this 
context?  Is there a better approach to this?

Thanks,

This doesn't really have anything to do with pollreactor.  Any reactor 
that implements IReactorFDSet can monitor a pipe.

It was easier for me to implement this than to explain what to do, so 
here's the code for monitoring a named pipe for read, given its name. 
I'm pretty sure it's not 100% correct, but if you want to read about 
handling I/O events from fifos on your platform, you are welcome to do 
so.

    import os
    from twisted.internet.abstract import FileDescriptor
    from twisted.internet.main import CONNECTION_DONE

    class FIFODescriptor(FileDescriptor):
        def __init__(self, reactor, fifoname, protocol):
            FileDescriptor.__init__(self, reactor)
            self.fifo = os.open(fifoname, os.O_NONBLOCK | os.O_RDONLY)
            self.protocol = protocol
            self.protocol.makeConnection(self)

        def connectionLost(self, reason):
            self.protocol.connectionLost(reason)

        def doRead(self):
            data = os.read(self.fifo, 1024)
            if data:
                self.protocol.dataReceived(data)
            else:
                self.stopReading()
                self.connectionLost(CONNECTION_DONE)

        def fileno(self):
            return self.fifo


And here's a brief program that uses it:

    import sys
    from twisted.internet import reactor
    from twisted.internet.protocol import Protocol
    class PrintingProtocol(Protocol):
        def dataReceived(self, data):
            print 'data', repr(data)
        def connectionMade(self):
            print 'hi'
        def connectionLost(self, reason):
            print 'bye', reason
    fifd = FIFODescriptor(reactor, sys.argv[1], PrintingProtocol())
    fifd.startReading()
    reactor.run()

I tested this by doing 'mkfifo x; python fifo.py x', and in another 
terminal, 'cat > x'.  It should be pretty self-explanitory.
