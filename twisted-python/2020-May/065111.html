I guess one thing I'm curious about is why your application would need to be installed along with the system Python on those OS versions?  It seems like a packaging strategy that ignored the fossilized versions that Debian packages with the system and just built its own Python would be more reliable and allow for upgrading at least most Python dependencies well beyond what the system would allow by policy.  Or, for that matter, why not just run in a Docker container?

Matrix is a pretty big user, and so in some sense I care about this specific case, but I also find the general question interesting, because I have difficulty reasoning about how long to support older versions of things in the modern application packaging environment where containers, virtualenvs, and associated tooling make it possible to effectively ignore the base environment. When &amp; why do you have to pay attention to it?
