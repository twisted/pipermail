</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Developing it within Twisted will make things go slower; you'll need to get everything code reviewed, you'll need to support multiple versions of Python (no py2 any more, but py3.5 is still pretty old), you'll have to have full test coverage from the get-go.  But doing these things from the start is much easier than trying to retrofit them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I actually think that this would be a pretty good fit for Twisted, in the same way that it's been a benefit to have Conch maintained alongside the rest of Twisted.  I can see you're developing things very much in line with Twisted's architecture (using cred for authentication, a realm interface, etc) and you've voiced this interest, so it would be great to have you along!
</I>
  I think it's great to get an SMB implementation in the Twisted org, but why would we even consider adding something like this to the main Twisted project?

  The main repo is large, and including Twisted in your project brings along far more functionality than you are likely to use, and packages are a fine way to get the functionality you want, so what's the logic for including a new thing in Twisted proper?

  You cite Conch above, where I'd actually argue that Conch should be moved to a separate repo.  Am I crazy?

  That said, a counter argument is that projects in the Twisted org suffer greatly from poor participation and strict development rules, resulting in glacial progress.  It's not unusual for me to have a PR take 6 months to a year to get a review (I have two right now that have been waiting since November), and perhaps such PRs would get some attention in the main repo.  But I think that's an unfortunate way to address that problem.
