Thanks, I appreciate your restraint.  Must say, most posts without  
code drive me a little cuckoo, too.  I hope this one was justified in  
not including specific code.

Ah, that would certainly make sense in this particular case.  I am  
asking the server for an *awful* lot of stuff all at one time.

&gt;<i> 2) the number of sockets is hitting a system limit (number of FDs  
</I>&gt;<i> you can pass
</I>&gt;<i>    to select(), or hitting the max number of file descriptors,  
</I>&gt;<i> something like
</I>&gt;<i>    that)
</I>
That may also be an issue, thank you for pointing that out.

&gt;<i> IIRC the RFCs say that clients SHOULD use no more than two  
</I>&gt;<i> concurrent connections to a server...
</I>
As you said, the performance is going to be rate-limited by the  
server's ability to respond to requests anyway, so I think what I'll  
do is just make it so that the &quot;get me a page&quot; queue doesn't put more  
than a couple of requests &quot;in-flight&quot; at the same time.

Thanks for helping me think this out!

Thanks,

S
