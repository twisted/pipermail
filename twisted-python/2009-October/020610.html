<PRE>So, I have a situation...

	I have an application whose basic function is, in simplified form:

	def main():
		get_web_page(main_page_from_params)

	def get_web_page(page_name):
		set up a page getter deferred,
			one of the callbacks gets the links out of the page and sends them  
to get_them()

	def get_them(links):
		for l in links:
			if l is not being gotten or hasn't been got:
				deferred = get_web_page(l)

	In other words, I feed in the top level page, then recursively feed  
in any pages linked to by the current page, and they feed in all their  
links, until all pages are gotten.

	I understand the concurrency issues with multiple deferred's trying  
to add pages to the &quot;get list&quot; -- it's properly handled in the code  
(far as I can tell, so far).

	So, here's the question...

	I have a &quot;pages&quot;  list containing all of the pages.

	They are set to either gotten or in-flight.

	In-flight means I have a deferred that's going to go get it (in  
get_web_page()).

	IOW, right now, if I don't already have the page, and I have a link  
to it, I just start a deferred to go get it.

	Should I limit the number of &quot;in-flight&quot; pages?

	Currently, I'm scanning sites that have upwards of 5000 pages and it  
seems that, when I get too many deferred's in flight, the app  
*appears* to crash.

	I'm not sure whether it's actually going out to lunch or just appears  
that way and, before I go instrumenting the app to death, can anyone  
tell me whether there is some sort of practical limit to how many &quot;in- 
flight&quot; deferreds might start to cause issues, just due to the sheer  
number?

	Thanks for any insight on this that anyone might offer.

	I expect the usual flurry of  &quot;you must post your exact code or we  
can't help you at all, moron&quot; posts, but...
	
	In spite of my not having posted specific code, could someone with  
some actual experience in this please give me a clue, within an order  
of magnitude, how many deferreds might start to cause real trouble?

Thanks,

S
