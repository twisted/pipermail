Yah, I started thinking about how far out I'd have to start the try/ 
except and started to get a headache when I thought about how much  
code it would have to encompass or, with an alternate approach, how  
many zillions of little extra blocks I'd have to insert everywhere.

</I>
I'm going to use the log observer option with tail -f in a separate  
console window on a linux console that's just sitting there doing  
nothing anyway.  That way, if it shows up on that terminal, something  
bad is happening.

Thanks!
