Yes, pretty much everything known about the round-trip is attached as  
attributes of the return value for easy inspection with a couple of  
little convenience methods for getting at them.

I just had a major debugging nightmare where the client, a web  
services company, insisted that &quot;I must be sending some weird headers&quot;  
and it wasn't that easy to prove I wasn't without being able to just  
access that info.  I finally ended up using tcpdump.  I had forgotten  
how much &quot;fun&quot; setting up tcpdump filters is.

</I>
Hopefully I can just fire up a virtualenv, set this as my Twisted, and  
run a few of the things I'm working on through it.

For some of them, I've been doing tcpdump pushups to find out what's  
going on and it'd be great to have that right in the Python code  
instead.

Please excuse my ignorance of how Twisted branches are used (there  
sure do seem to be a lot of them!), but is this branch supposed to be  
trunk + branch mods or latest release + branch mods?

Thanks!
