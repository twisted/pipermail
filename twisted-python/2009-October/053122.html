Cool, I didn't know about that, I'll give it a look.  Thanks!

It's not that I don't understand what's supposed to be happening, or  
that it's doing something strange, it just seems that sites up to  
about 2000 pages work fine, then things get dicey.

I was just looking for some guidance on the &quot;max-deferred&quot; that has  
been found in practical experience more than anything else.

&gt;<i>  Regardless of any practical advice you may receive as a temporary  
</I>&gt;<i> stopgap, there's always a chance that something else is going wrong,  
</I>&gt;<i> and by reducing the number of concurrent requests you're just  
</I>&gt;<i> decreasing its likelihood rather than properly fixing it.
</I>
I understand, and agree.  I'm not looking for a stopgap, just maybe a  
ballpark of &quot;don't set more than 2000 in-flight deferreds at one time&quot;  
type of guideline.

I understand that every situation is different, I'm working to limit  
my in-filght requests to a manageable number,

&gt;<i> It's highly unlikely that it's actually the number of Deferreds.  A  
</I>&gt;<i> Deferred is just a Python object, so if you've got the RAM to store  
</I>&gt;<i> them and their associated callbacks, you should be fine.
</I>
Yes, I understand that, thank you for clarifying.

&gt;<i> It's more likely that it has something to do with long callback  
</I>&gt;<i> chains, or hitting some kind of file-descriptor limit
</I>
The callback chains are short, and I'm not getting a file-descriptor  
limit exception, or any exception that's getting percolated up.

&gt;<i> (what version of Twisted are you using?)
</I>
Sorry for not including this earlier...

# python -V
Python 2.6.1

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import twisted
 &gt;&gt;&gt; twisted.__version__
'8.2.0'

I'm running right out of the release versions for these tests since  
that's what my users will have installed.

&gt;<i> or perhaps that 5000 pages is just a lot of pages to request and you  
</I>&gt;<i> might need to wait a while.
</I>
Yes, it is a lot of stuff...

What I'm working on determining is whether limiting the number of &quot;in- 
flight&quot; URL getters would beneficial.

Thanks,

S
