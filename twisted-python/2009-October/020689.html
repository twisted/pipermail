To think about it another way, what happens when an unhandled exception occurs
in a thread?  The thread dies, and Python simply throws the traceback at stderr.
There's not much else it can reasonably do.  If you want to catch (or suppress)
that error, you add (another) try/except at the outermost layer of the call
stack.

Possibly Twisted could provide some sort of last-ditch error reporting hook,
like sys.excepthook in core Python, but I'm not sure it would offer much
advantage over writing a log observer that looks for events where isError is
set.
