</I>
Yes, we're working on it but it's a large code base and we started  
with exactly zero tests.  While that leaves infinite room for  
improvement, it's a little overwhelming.  Oh well, at least we know  
where to concentrate first ;-0.

&gt;<i> Trial will helpfully fail tests which cause exceptions to be logged,

</I>&gt;<i> blows up you will see it.
</I>
We've just been using nose; is that something Trial handles specially  
for Twisted?

&gt;<i> Basically, in one branch of the errBack, there was a typo.  A simple
</I>&gt;<i> typo that caused an unhandled NameError exception, but only once in  a
</I>&gt;<i> few thousand runs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it's a NameError, you also could have used Pyflakes to catch it :).
</I>
That's in our list of 'things to put in the commit pre-hook' as well.   
I'm not sure pyflakes would have caught this one, though because it's  
a legitimate instance variable, it's just not set to something usable  
before this particular error condition comes up.

&gt;<i> The exception got caught and &quot;displayed&quot; by Twisted, but it wasn't
</I>&gt;<i> going anyplace anyone was looking (buried under zillions of lines of
</I>&gt;<i> logging) and the app continues on as if nothing went wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The real lesson here is that you should be paying attention to  
</I>&gt;<i> logged tracebacks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are many ways to do this.  Many operations teams running  
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted servers will trawl the logs with regular expressions.  Not  
</I>&gt;<i> my preferred way of doing it, but I'm not really an ops person :).
</I>
I'm not much on the ops end either but I guess I'm learning...

&gt;<i> If you want to handle logged exceptions specially, for example to  
</I>&gt;<i> put them in a separate file, or to e-mail them to somebody, consider  
</I>&gt;<i> writing a log observer that checks for the isError key and does  
</I>&gt;<i> something special there.  You can find out more about writing log  
</I>&gt;<i> observers here: &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/logging.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/logging.html</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;.
</I>
This is an area of Twisted I haven't explored at all since the code's  
all using the standard Python logging.

That's the thing about Twisted; sometimes it's hard to know whether  
the stuff that has been built into standard Python since Twisted  
'rolled their own' is a superset, a subset, or a completely different  
beast.  Logging is a good case in point.  Since we're using Python's  
logging everywhere, I wasn't even sure whether there would be an  
advantage to learning Twisted's similar system.  Twisted's trial is  
another example; we've just been using nose.  Seems like there's  
always some little extra that makes the Twisted stuff worth knowing.

&gt;<i> What is the best way to handle programming errors like this in
</I>&gt;<i> deferreds so they don't slip by, unnoticed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm answering a question you didn't ask, about logged errors,  
</I>&gt;<i> because I think it's the one you meant to ask.  The answer to the  
</I>&gt;<i> question you are actually asking here, i.e. &quot;how do I handle errors  
</I>&gt;<i> in an errback&quot;, is quite simple: add another errback.  This is sort  
</I>&gt;<i> of like asking how to handle exceptions in an 'except:' block in  
</I>&gt;<i> Python.  For example, if you want to catch errors from this code:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> try:
</I>&gt;<i>   foo()
</I>&gt;<i> except:
</I>&gt;<i>   oops()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you could modify it to look like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> try:
</I>&gt;<i>   foo()
</I>&gt;<i> except:
</I>&gt;<i>   try:
</I>&gt;<i>     oops()
</I>&gt;<i>   except:
</I>&gt;<i>     handleOopsOops()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> which is what adding another errback is like.  But, as I said: I  
</I>&gt;<i> don't think this is what you want, since it will only let you handle  
</I>&gt;<i> un-handled errors in Deferreds (not unhandled errors in, for  
</I>&gt;<i> example, protocols) and you will have to attach your error-handling  
</I>&gt;<i> callbacks everywhere (not to mention trying to guess a sane return  
</I>&gt;<i> value for the error-handler-error-handler.
</I>
Right, I started thinking down that infinitely nested slippery slope  
and figured there must be a better way.  I think the logging question  
you answered that I didn't ask was the one I meant ;-).

Thanks again for another enlightening answer.
