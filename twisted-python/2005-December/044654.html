Yes, that was indeed the problem. My server was taking a root object
from a client and attempting to pass it on to another server as an
argument to a remote method. Thanks.

I now have a further question:

When my server takes the root object from a client it keeps and uses that 
object,
later on, to call remote methods on the client (as described in the docs).
What I am not sure about is what happens to the root object if the TCP/IP
connection goes down between the server and client.

Presumably, nothing will happen until I try to call a remote method on the
client?

In which case, how can the server attempt to reconnect to the client if it
only has the original root object given to it by the client and the 
connection
has temporarily gone down? Or is the client responsible for keeping the 
connection
open?

Thanks
