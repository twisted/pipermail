<PRE>Hi

I am trying to call a remote method on a client from a server using a 
reference that has been given to the server by the client.

I am trying to do this in the way described in your &quot;References to 
Client-side objects&quot; documentation.
However, I keep getting the following error: &quot;Can't send references to 
brokers other than their own.&quot; and I can't see why.

Any help with this error would be greatly appreciated.
