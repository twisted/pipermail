It's hard to know what you need here.  Can you elaborate more on this &quot;other
logic&quot;?

Note though that the callLater will also &quot;make the sendCmd be called after the
reactor run&quot; -- although a clearer phrasing would be &quot;make the sendCmd be called
after the reactor starts&quot;, so I don't understand why it is inappropriate for
you.

Also, saying &quot;the server(reactor)&quot; suggests to me that you misunderstand the
role of the reactor.  The reactor isn't your server; it's the event loop that
runs all the networking Twisted does, servers, clients, whatever.  You don't
want to stop and start it for each task, or have a seperate one for each task,
it's a single object that handles the events that occur (like sockets receiving
data) and dispatching them to the right object.

-Andrew.
