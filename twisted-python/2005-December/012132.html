<PRE>Hi Ken

Many thanks for your reply. Sorry for not replying earlier - I seem to have
lost some mail due to ISP problems, and I just noticed your message in the
archive.

I have not included your response, as I want to come at this from another
angle. I confess that I am under pressure to 'get something working', even
if it is not the optimal solution, and this is all getting a bit
complicated.

I have been experimenting with using a socket client instead of Twisted, and
I got something up and running quite quickly. When I take a step back and
look at how I got it working, I feel that I should be able to apply the same
technique to Twisted, but I cannot get it to work. I will show both methods,
and perhaps someone can point me in the right direction.

The trick is that I have two threads running concurrently - a wxPython main
loop, and a subthread that monitors the socket. The socket loop looks like
this (simplified), subclassed from threading.Thread -

    def run(self):
        readable = [s.fileno()]
        error = []
        self.sendData = []
        while 1:
            if self.sendData:
                writable = [s.fileno()]
            else:
                writable = []
            r,w,e = select.select(readable,writable,error,0.01)
            if r:
                self.recvData = s.recv(1024)
            if w:
                s.send(self.sendData.pop(0))

    def checkData(self,item,value):  # this is called from the *wx* thread
        self.recvData = None
        self.sendData.append(cPickle.dumps((CHECK,item,value)))
        while self.recvData is None:
            sleep(0.01)
        return self.recvData

As you can see, checkData() blocks the wxPython thread until it receives a
response from the socket thread.

This is how I tried with Twisted -

    def checkData(self,item,value):  # this is called from the *wx* thread
        self.recvData = None
        self.callCheckData(item,value)
        while self.recvData is None:
            sleep(0.01)
        return self.recvData

    def callCheckData(self,item,value):
 
self.avatar.callRemote('checkData',item,value).addCallback(self.dataChecked)

    def dataChecked(self,answer):
        self.recvData = answer

It looks as if it should work, but the server method 'perspective_checkData'
never gets called.

Is it possible to do anything like this?

Thanks

Frank Millman
