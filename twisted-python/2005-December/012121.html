Sounds like an object aliasing problem.
And I don't think that it's *objects* that are being
re-used, but *memory locations* for same-class objects.

Don't use the built-in id() function. I'm not sure if this
is correct, but it seems to me something like the memory
address of the object. When the memory gets re-used, the
same ID sometimes recurrs.

*****
If you need a unique identifier for your application logic,
create and assign it yourself. Don't use the id() function.

One possibility is to give each AckMgr/RepMgr pair an auction ID.

Create a simple ID generator (object or function).
When you create a new AckMgr and RepMgr, get a new ID
from the generator and assign it to each one *before*
you use it.

The AckMgr then could simply ignore any response that
doesn't have the expected ID.

More generally, I would put the AckMgrs in a dictionary,
keyed by the action ID. I would have *one* function/method
(ProcessAck) that gets responses and dispatches them to the
appropriate AckMgr, or drops them if no matching AckMgr
is found. This would make testing, debugging, and tuning
easier, too, by providing a single location for
instrumentation.
