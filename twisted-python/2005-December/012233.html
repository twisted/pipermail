IMHO the &quot;occasionally&quot; is the only wrong thing of the whole story. It
must not be &quot;occasionally&quot;, it must be &quot;occasionally _or_ when the task
is growing to an insanse size&quot;. The total amount of anonymous memory
allocated by the interpreter must be tracked in O(1) and a collect()
should have been invokved at least every time the amount of memory
doubled.

The reason it took me so long before I could suspect the gc, is that
coming from a vm kernel background, I couldn't even dream that after the
task grown up to &gt;1G and the system was into swap, the python gc didn't
even yet try to prune all potentially freeable objects. The gc should
definitely be in function of &quot;size&quot; too, and currently it's not. There
is definitely room for improvements in the gc by adding heuristics in
function of &quot;size of anonymous memory allocated&quot;, and it doesn't seem
difficult to add it, nor it should impact performance since the
deep gc.collect() (the only costly thing) would very rarely be invoked
more frequently.
