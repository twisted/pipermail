If you can replicate the exact branch and changes you had difficulty with, I'd love to hear about the specifics, because this sounds like maybe it's a gotcha we should add to some development documentation.  It should not be possible for this to happen with a simple 'svn up' so I want to know what command to tell users they should avoid.

Feel free to reply off-list if it gets into fiddly details of subversion that might be off-topic.

&gt;<i> This is another rhetorical anecdote, I tried using git-svn when I was

You say &quot;rhetorical anecdote&quot;, I say &quot;FUD&quot; :).  But, perhaps you are more just in the class of users that need somebody like Duncan's help in order to use git against Twisted effectively, rather than the class of users who know the version control tools well enough to be able to provide that help.

&gt;<i> I may just be a drooling moron.
</I>

I didn't say you were a &quot;moron&quot;, being unable to figure out git's UI for something is merely an indication that you probably aren't eligible for the Fields medal; frankly I have a great deal of difficulty with it as well.  If I didn't, I might have updated things myself.

I hope you'll have a better time once those instructions are updated.
