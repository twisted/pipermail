Sadly, this is not the case. As has already been pointed out, virtual 
machine clocks can undergo stepping in &quot;normal&quot; oepration. A specfic 
example: if a VMWare installation performs live migration of a host. We 
often see:

ntpd[1793]: time reset +0.263757 s

...when this happens. This can occur several times a day, as we're 
running vCenter-controlled auto-migration - a very common setup. This is 
forward stepping of course, so is relatively harmless (backward is a pain).

I have no reason to suspect they are doing somthing silly. I merely 
point out that there are other implmentations than the common ntpd, and 
that I don't know if they step or not. In fact, a little research 
suggests that chrony has *better* behaviour w.r.t stepping than ntpd:

...which is nice.

I sense a bit of defensiveness to this reply, TBH. Maybe I'm imagniing 
it, but if so that's unncessary. I don't hold a strong position about 
Twisted having a monotonic clock.

When the original ticket was discussed here months ago, I was quite 
alarmed because the symptoms sounded dire. Further discussion clarified 
what the issues were, and I decided they weren't significant (for us).

Maybe &quot;Twisted doesn't need a monotonic clock&quot; is the right reply, but 
it would be wrong to base that on the assumpton that &quot;ntpd doesn't step&quot; 
- that's all I was trying to say.

Cheers,
Phil
