&gt;<i> Hi.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to gauge any interest in (or resistance towards) adding mock
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/mock.html">http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/mock.html</A>) as a dependency for
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> test suite.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short, while I don't necessarily feel strongly about behavior vs. state
</I>&gt;<i> based verification being preferred in a general sense, I think both have
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i> place when used with sensibility. (Sorry, I know that's not saying too
</I>&gt;<i> much of
</I>&gt;<i> substance, but I'm trying to ward off a discussion on whether or not it
</I>&gt;<i> has a
</I>&gt;<i> place at all if possible).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The *benefit* though for me in having mock present is that it decreases the
</I>&gt;<i> lines of code necessary to write stubs and mocks. While doing so is not
</I>&gt;<i> really
</I>&gt;<i> that difficult anyhow, it *is* just a bit more clutter to do so without
</I>&gt;<i> mock,
</I>&gt;<i> and the extra 3 or 4 lines mean that in more than one instance I have found
</I>&gt;<i> myself pick a different strategy than I would have because of the extra
</I>&gt;<i> lines
</I>&gt;<i> of code that clutter the test method.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To give a specific example, as I write this I'm writing tests for #6143
</I>&gt;<i> (which
</I>&gt;<i> will hopefully let trial drop into a debugger on an error or failure rather
</I>&gt;<i> than at the outset of a test run). To do so I want to write tests that look
</I>&gt;<i> like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     def test_itDebugsOnError(self):
</I>&gt;<i>         result = mock.Mock()
</I>&gt;<i>         exc_type, exc_value, tb = mock.Mock(), mock.Mock(), mock.Mock()
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         decorated = DebugDecorator(result)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         with mock.patch.object(decorated, &quot;debug&quot;) as debug:
</I>&gt;<i>             decorated.addError(exc_type, exc_value, tb)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         debug.assert_called_once_with(tb)
</I>&gt;<i>         result.addError.assert_called_once_with(exc_type, exc_value, tb)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> where I want to test that the decorated test result is being used as I
</I>&gt;<i> expect
</I>&gt;<i> it to, and that debug is being called. Another test will test that debug
</I>&gt;<i> does
</I>&gt;<i> what it's supposed to, also in isolation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course none of the objects I used there were very interesting, but mock
</I>&gt;<i> has
</I>&gt;<i> similarly terse syntax for creating mocks with attributes, return values,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;<i> amongst a bunch of other useful features which I'll be happy to elaborate
</I>&gt;<i> on if
</I>&gt;<i> anyone would like, I just had the above example at hand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To add a few more notes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - mock is in the stdlib starting with 3.3 as unittest.mock, which as I
</I>&gt;<i>    understand it is the first version of Py3 for which support is planned.
</I>&gt;<i> So
</I>&gt;<i>    really all that'd be needed would be to add mock as a dependency on 2.X.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - it's a single file with no external deps, so installation is not
</I>&gt;<i> difficult,
</I>&gt;<i>    and it'd only be a dep for running the tests (and presumably only a
</I>&gt;<i> subset
</I>&gt;<i>    thereof that chose to use it)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - there are other mocking libraries, but I don't like any of the others as
</I>&gt;<i>    much personally for various reasons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - I'd be willing to do the small amount of work to add it if there'd be
</I>&gt;<i>    interest :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Julian
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I like mock, but for me, using mocks is a method of last resort.  I don't
see a lot of need for it in internal Twisted tests (except maybe in adbapi?
 I don't know what the tests for that currently look like, but it seems a
logical place).
