For what it's worth - I think adbapi is seriously sub-optimal in this 
regard. We have continual low-level problems with Twisted apps getting 
stuck due to hung/dead ConnectionPool. And if you forget cp_reconnect, 
well you are basically committing suicide. Your Twisted app will need a 
restart.

In particular - it's not clear to my why CP isn't using &quot;cp_good_sql&quot; to 
probe a connection *before* starting the transaction, and to 
close/re-open it transparently if it has died and cp_reconnect==1.

Instead, the only place the &quot;good&quot; SQL is run is *after* a rollback, so 
the next N transactions into the pool (where N is the number of threads) 
all fail, because they don't get as far as &quot;rollback&quot;.

I think the behaviour it should be aiming for is clear:

  1. Test each connection with &quot;good_sql&quot; before beginning the user 
interaction/query
  2. If execeptions occur inside the user interaction, either at cursor 
methods like execute, or connection methods like commit, then:
     1. rollback - if *this* raises an exception, throw the conn away
     2. propagate the original exception upwards unchanged (maybe 
wrapped, maybe not)

cp_reconnect should be the default.
