<PRE>quests per second while Twisted and Cyclone were only handling 400-500 requ=
ests per second.
On loopback from the same m1.small I suspect I was starting to load test th=
e load testers more than the apps but locally all the frameworks were perfo=
rming similarly.
Load testing from another machine to my laptop I was seeing far better perf=
ormance from Twisted and Cyclone, both doing closer to 2k requests per seco=
nd. The other frameworks were only a little quicker but again, there's a ch=
ance the machine running the load tests was the bottle neck.
These tests were very unscientifically done but I still wasn't expecting to=
 see such a big difference between specifically node and Twisted.=A0 500 re=
q/sec is plenty quick for 90% of what I do and of course I know there's so =
much more to an application than returning hello world but I was wondering =
if I was missing some trick to speed Twisted up to get close to the others =
on EC2.
