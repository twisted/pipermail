I never have much trouble, of course I always have a C compiler installed
and never use the Windows installer for Twisted any more.  The main issue I
have with installing Twisted, is that in order to use any of the command
like tools I have to go in and muck with the files (I think they just have
to be renamed...been a while since I've done it), since Twisted uses the
old distutils &quot;script&quot; method of installing them, rather than using
setuptools/sitribute or distutils2/packaging or whatever.

This means the various command line tools get installed (IIRC and if my
info is up to date) without file extensions, which is fine in a Unixy
environment, but don't work a'tall on Windows.


&gt;<i> Also I don't particularly like the testing style associated with Mock.  I
</I>&gt;<i> think it might discourage us yet further from writing verified fakes, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> supported in-memory implementations of things like IReactorTCP, that have
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat intricate behavior that's tedious to emulate with Mock.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>My experience with mock is that when you need it it's really really
obvious, and if you don't, you shouldn't start using it, as it starts to
become a crutch.


&gt;<i> Personally I'm -0.  Don't let that stop you from cooking up a patch that
</I>&gt;<i> would include it though, I might be in the minority here.
