<PRE>requests per second while Twisted and Cyclone were only handling 400-500
requests per second.

On loopback from the same m1.small I suspect I was starting to load test
the load testers more than the apps but locally all the frameworks were
performing similarly.

Load testing from another machine to my laptop I was seeing far better
performance from Twisted and Cyclone, both doing closer to 2k requests per
second. The other frameworks were only a little quicker but again, there's
a chance the machine running the load tests was the bottle neck.

These tests were very unscientifically done but I still wasn't expecting to
see such a big difference between specifically node and Twisted.  500
req/sec is plenty quick for 90% of what I do and of course I know there's
so much more to an application than returning hello world but I was
wondering if I was missing some trick to speed Twisted up to get close to
the others on EC2.

&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hi all&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I recently wrote a hello wor=
ld HTTP app in Twisted, Cyclone, node, Go and Scala on the Play framework, =
and used a combination of ab and gattling to see how fast each was on an m1=
.small instance on Amazon EC2. I also tested it on bare metal (my laptop:))=
 but I&amp;#39;ll get to that later.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The code I used for twisted was the web server code sample f=
rom the front page of &lt;a href=3D&quot;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com&quot;">http://twistedmatrix.com&quot;</A>&gt;twistedmatrix.co=
m&lt;/a&gt; with the numberRequests increment dropped and a simple &amp;quot;Hello Wo=
rld!&amp;quot; returned instead.&lt;br&gt;
For cyclone I used the sample code from the cyclone docs with the same stri=
ng being returned.&lt;br&gt;Node was the sample from their front page.&lt;br&gt;Play an=
d Go I&amp;#39;ve never worked with before so those were copy pastes from vario=
us examples on their pages but again same URI and return string as the othe=
r frameworks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;From one m1.small to another, Go, Play and node w=
ere handling about 1.5k requests per second while Twisted and Cyclone were =
