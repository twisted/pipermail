</I>Well, if they don't honour what the documentation says, then they seem 
broken
to me, and the documentation doesn't say you might get an unexpected
64 connection limit. No matter.
&gt;<i> Please feel free to contribute patches which reduce these limitations.

here <A HREF="http://www.lenholgate.com/archives/000456.html">http://www.lenholgate.com/archives/000456.html</A> I guess.
&gt;<i> and maybe some other features too (I don't have a Windows handy or the

</I>&gt;<i> better-documented).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The select reactor is also convenient for testing on Windows, because

</I>&gt;<i> support Win32.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your suggestion for handle buckets in the win32eventreactor is one 
</I>&gt;<i> which has been suggested before and sounds good to me.  Nobody has 
</I>&gt;<i> bothered to implement it yet :).  However, even in its absence, I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't believe we'll be completely dropping win32eventreactor because 
</I>&gt;<i> it is useful for integrating with programs that do win32 drawing, even 
</I>&gt;<i> if iocpreactor has higher performance and is more scalable.
</I>Well, you need a daemon worker thread to call GetQueuedCompletionStatus(Ex)
and enqueue the results to the main thread, but that daemon worker doesn't
even need to have the full support of the C library multithreading so 
long as it just
swizzles pointers and calls raw API routines. Its normally more of a 
gotcha that
you might try to submit IO from a pool thread that might reasonably be 
terminated
before the IO completes. Why do you need an event reactor to support win32
applications, except to call MsgWait... rather than 
GetQueuedCompletionStatus?

On a similar sort of topic - is there a reason to have lots of 
implementations
for POSIX, rather than use libevent or libev?
