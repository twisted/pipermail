I used both recently with adbapi, and everything seemed fine. I  
remember both of them missing some features that I was used to with  
MySQLdb, like customizable cursor classes and so forth, but nothing  
that was a deal-breaker.

I never ran this in production, but I did run stress tests with both  
these drivers against a copy of a production database. There were no  
driver-related issues, just syntax errors (the web app was originally  
written for MySQL, and there was a small amount of non-standard SQL).

I have run into threading issues with pretty much every driver, so I  
wouldn't discount psycopg2 because of that...

&gt;<i> Also, we're considering turning on SSL client-certificate verification

</I>&gt;<i> the above support SSL client certificates?
</I>
I know pygresql doesn't support this, but I'm not sure about psycopg2.
