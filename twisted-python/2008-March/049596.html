This is indeed a shame. I come to Twisted an experienced Ruby and Java
developer in need for a event-driven networking framework. I had taken
a close look at ruby's EventMachine, which is modeled after Twisted,
but was strongly leaning towards Twisted *for* the documentation (and
the apparent stability and age of the project). At the very least,
Twisted has an Oreilly book and docs on the website (EM only provides
rdoc).

So, I bought the Oreilly book and Python in a Nutshell. I've made it
through the Nutshell book (I spent 3 months doing python back in 2003,
so it's not completely new to me). My next steps include the book
first and online docs second...but now am I to understand that both
are useless? Should I just dive into the code instead?

Here's to hoping at least the concepts are introduced effectively...

John
