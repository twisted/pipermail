<PRE>Apologies for the previous premature email; it seems I cannot read.
The apparent contradiction I mentioned was the result of my conflating
'callback' with 'addCallback'.  However, I guess I'd still appreciate
some discussion on the nuances of these two functions.

Cheers

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>   I have been using twisted intermittently for a couple of months, but
</I>&gt;<i>  still don't feel like I have a good intuitive understanding of how to
</I>&gt;<i>  get things done quickly, and efficiently with the framework.  Thus
</I>&gt;<i>  I've been revisiting the tutorial documents and resolved to go through
</I>&gt;<i>  them with a fine-toothed comb in an effort to really get my noggin
</I>&gt;<i>  around things.
</I>&gt;<i>   In the deffered discussion:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/defer.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/defer.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   there is a section about defer.DeferredList, which contains code
</I>&gt;<i>  examples and a subsequent note which -seems- to contradict the code
</I>&gt;<i>  above it:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  ------------begin code from tutorial----------
</I>&gt;<i>  The callback will be called with a list of the results of the
</I>&gt;<i>  Deferreds it contains, like so:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  def printResult(result):
</I>&gt;<i>     print result
</I>&gt;<i>  deferred1 = defer.Deferred()
</I>&gt;<i>  deferred2 = defer.Deferred()
</I>&gt;<i>  deferred3 = defer.Deferred()
</I>&gt;<i>  dl = defer.DeferredList([deferred1, deferred2, deferred3])
</I>&gt;<i>  dl.addCallback(printResult)
</I>&gt;<i>  deferred1.callback('one')
</I>&gt;<i>  deferred2.errback('bang!')
</I>&gt;<i>  deferred3.callback('three')
</I>&gt;<i>  # At this point, dl will fire its callback, printing:
</I>&gt;<i>  #     [(1, 'one'), (0, 'bang!'), (1, 'three')]
</I>&gt;<i>  # (note that defer.SUCCESS == 1, and defer.FAILURE == 0)
</I>&gt;<i>  ------------end code from tutorial----------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Ok, so far, so good.  You can build a series of deferreds, stick them
</I>&gt;<i>  in a DeferredList, add a callback to the list, *subsequently* add some
</I>&gt;<i>  callbacks/errbacks to the individual deferreds in the DeferredList,
</I>&gt;<i>  fire things up, and have the results of the *subsequently added*
</I>&gt;<i>  callbacks/errbacks sent to the DeferredList callback and printed out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  However, the following Note regarding callbacks for DeferredList
</I>&gt;<i>  objects seems to contradict the promised results of the above
</I>&gt;<i>  codeblock, stating that:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;&quot;&quot;If you want to apply callbacks to the individual Deferreds that go
</I>&gt;<i>  into the DeferredList, you should be careful about when those
</I>&gt;<i>  callbacks are added. The act of adding a Deferred to a DeferredList
</I>&gt;<i>  inserts a callback into that Deferred (when that callback is run, it
</I>&gt;<i>  checks to see if the DeferredList has been completed yet). The
</I>&gt;<i>  important thing to remember is that it is this callback which records
</I>&gt;<i>  the value that goes into the result list handed to the DeferredList's
</I>&gt;<i>  callback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Therefore, if you add a callback to the Deferred after adding the
</I>&gt;<i>  Deferred to the DeferredList, the value returned by that callback will
</I>&gt;<i>  not be given to the DeferredList's callback. To avoid confusion, we
</I>&gt;<i>  recommend not adding callbacks to a Deferred once it has been used in
</I>&gt;<i>  a DeferredList.&quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Ok, so in fact, any callbacks/errbacks I need to add to deferreds
</I>&gt;<i>  which will be added to a DeferredList object, need to be added Prior
</I>&gt;<i>  to my adding the individual deferreds to the DeferredList object.  Or
</I>&gt;<i>  so it would appear to my limited understanding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I would greatly appreciate it if someone could resolve this apparent
</I>&gt;<i>  contradiction for me, or if it is a mistake in the documentation,
</I>&gt;<i>  please point out which one of the code block or the note is actually
</I>&gt;<i>  correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Cheers!
</I>&gt;<i>
