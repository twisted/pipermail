Indeed. Also important is understanding *why* something is wrong.
Sometimes this is non-obvious, or counter-intuitive, which can be
confusing to the novice.

&gt;<i> &gt;The easiest place to start learning is with code that

</I>
I completely agree. I guess I was trying to say that when I start to
learn something new, it's easier if I can start with a bit of newness
that isn't completely alien to me.

&gt;<i> In the case of Twisted, I found the Abe Fettig book
</I>&gt;<i> good - I looked at webcat.py and requesthandler.py and
</I>&gt;<i> that gave me a start. From time to time, I also posted
</I>&gt;<i> on this mailing list to get little examples - very
</I>&gt;<i> helpful. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also like the design patterns approach to learning:
</I>&gt;<i> this is the name, the situation/context, the problem,
</I>&gt;<i> the solution, references. 
</I>
Definitely, particularly when it's something that comes up a lot. The
canonical echo server/client example is ok, but it's a toy problem, not
a real world thing. It might be nice to have a real world example of
something (simple!) most people are likely to want to do, and how
Twisted makes it easy/great.

It'd be great if there was a sequence of tutorials designed to get
people to the 'Aha!' moment of twisted where it all suddenly makes
sense. Maybe there already is, and I'm simply ignorant.
