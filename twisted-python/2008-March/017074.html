It was, nevertheless, a dramatic mistake.  The point still holds.

Thanks.

</I>
I'm pretty sure there are also some edge-cases that aren't handled 
completely correctly in adbapi, although clearly they don't affect 
production systems terribly much :).  Just have a look through the 
bugtracker for enterprise issues.

And, thanks a _lot_.  Even with the resources the foundation will be 
providing us, we're still going to have a shortage of qualified helpers 
:<i>).
