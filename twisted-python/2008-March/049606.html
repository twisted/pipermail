<PRE>Hi Folks:

&gt;<i>  Clearly, the issues Twisted addresses are
</I>non-&gt;trivial requiring an appreciation of the problem
&gt;<i>space before considering Twisted as a solution (you
</I>&gt;<i>gotta know there's a question before someone tells
</I>you
&gt;<i> the  answer)... unfortunately, the barrier to
</I>&gt;<i>Twisted entry at that point makes most walk away.
</I>&gt;<i>I've seen lots of threads concluding, simply,
</I>&gt;<i>that twisted looked interesting but was simply too
</I>&gt;<i>dense to even get started with... so, they go ahead
</I>&gt;<i>and roll their own solution,  inevitably identifying
</I>&gt;<i>the issues which form heart of the twisted  
</I>&gt;<i>architecture, but being too far along to refactor. 
</I>&gt;<i>And away we go.
</I>
I have barely scratched the surface of Twisted - some
of my experiences and suggestions:

1) I found that Abe Fettig's book was a set of good
training wheels. Not as good as say, Richard Steven's
&quot;UNIX Network Programming&quot; that really saved my bacon
when I was first learning socket programming. However
Fettig's book is good in the sense that I can find a
concrete example (HTTP RequestHandler), modify it a
bit and it does something useful. Gets me going while
I learn. Newbies need to build confidence with quick
successes.

Now I go to Twisted documentation that makes far more
sense as I need much more technical detail about what
Twisted is doing.

If I had to alter Twisted documentation, I would make
much of the stuff do concrete things, like get a web
page. 

Perhaps I would, through surveys, pick the ten most
common things new developers want to do, and show
examples.

2) Pictures. Both Twisted documentation and Fettig's
book lack pictures. 

When I was looking for a bug involving a Twisted call
that never fired the callback, I took notes, peppered
Twisted with logging statements, used a debugger and
asked questions, lots of questions. The resulting
control flow picture was sufficiently different from
what I had in mind.

That said, I would be tempted to do a simple client
example and server example and illustrate the control
flow, carefully matching the drawings with the
illustrations. I know this is tough. 

Idioms:

Perhaps this is closely related with common examples,
but show common idioms. For example, how to call a
database or a web server from a request handler. Or
scheduling work with reactor.callLater or Tasks.

Cheers,
Andrew
