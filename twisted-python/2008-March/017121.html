<PRE>Quoting coder_gus &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">coder_gus at lavabit.com</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> Agreed, I was talking about transport.tcpKeepAlive(). The thing I am
</I>&gt;<i> asking (and call me stupid, but I am trying to figure it out for days
</I>&gt;<i> now and no one seems to answer my question or is it me too stupid that
</I>&gt;<i> can see the answer in front of my eyes) is how do I send data to
</I>&gt;<i> clients that are connected to the twisted server waiting for data to be
</I>&gt;<i> processed, without sending to the server any data or causing any event
</I>&gt;<i> to the server?
</I>
This is where you are confused I think. There is no way to send data  
to clients if you don't have *any* events on the server. Because how  
would you now to send data if you don't have something telling you to  
do so? You should have a time event, or a network event from another  
client, or a GUI input, or whatever.

&gt;<i> In the link you guys showed me it's true that the data
</I>&gt;<i> gets back to the clients, but only when the server receives other data,
</I>&gt;<i> that is in the dataReceived method. How can I send it back to them
</I>&gt;<i> (having a reference to each client's protocol class) without receiving
</I>&gt;<i> data, client connecting etc. ?
</I>
It's not totally clear to understand what you're trying to achieve, so  
maybe you want to explain more clearly your problem. I suspect you  
want to use reactor.callLater, to generate a time event.
