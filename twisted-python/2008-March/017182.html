<PRE>Hi Don:

[Don quote]
Thanks to all the good folks who replied to this; good
stuff to chew on. I particularly liked glyph's advice
on when and where to use the inline callback style,
and when/where to avoid it.  I think I'll continue
along the path I described, at least for a while.  I
may be back with more on this topic.

I saw your post but didn't have time to respond
earlier.... I second Glyph's advice concerning
inlineCallbacks....

I am building a WS-BPEL processor. WS-BPEL is about
business logic and exotic message exchange patterns. I
gave a talk at PyCon 2008 called &quot;Adventures in
Stackless Python Twisted Integration.&quot;

My strategy is to separate the business logic as much
as possible from the underlying networking. At the
lower levels, I use Stackless Python in conjunction
with Twisted. A side-effect of this approach is that I
can block waiting for a Twisted call to finish.

Right now, I am simplifying one of my prototypes so I
can post it as a full-blown example of all the
techniques I use. Give me a few days.

To add to what others have said, the main problem I
have encountered boil down to identifying classic
concurrency problems. Unfortunately APIs and
transitivity obscure bugs. I know this sounds obvious 
but no matter which concurrency model you use: event,
pre-emptive threads, cooperate, you really have to
understand how problems like say, deadlock and race
conditions manifest themselves and take precautions.

In the narrow field of Stackless and Twisted, I am
trying to map out what those precautions are.

Cheers,
Andrew
