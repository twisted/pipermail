Honestly, I don't think we're dealing with a design pattern issue now.

</I>&gt;<i>  For example:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>  Client 2 connects -- Factory instantiates Protocol class to handle

</I>&gt;<i>  &lt;time has passed until server decides it needs to send a plugin to one

</I>&gt;<i>  Server sends plugin to Client 1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  So how can that server send data to client 1 if client 1 hasn't caused
</I>&gt;<i>  an event (The server side causes a certain event it should send data
</I>&gt;<i>  to a selected client).
</I>
Define `event'.  Is the initial connection not an event?  If you have
an open connection, the client doesn't have fart back through it every
5 seconds (by the semantics of most protocols) to keep it open or
anything.

&gt;<i>  I understand that if a client sends data to the
</I>&gt;<i>  server I can than write back to the client using the dataReceived
</I>&gt;<i>  function within the Protocol instantiation.
</I>
Are you sure you understand?  You're calling dataReceive to send data?
 If you're calling a method (that's what you meant by &quot;function within
the Protocol instantiation&quot;, I guess) with &quot;receive&quot; in the name, then
you can only be very confused.

&gt;<i> In this case once N number
</I>&gt;<i>  of agents have connected I want the server to push data to the clients
</I>&gt;<i>  without the Client writing to the server. Thanks again for the help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
So write back data to the client.  That's all I can say until you
describe what you've tried (w/ code) and why it failed (w/ a
stacktrace) - vs. in pretty vague terms on essay on what you want to
do and haven't even attempted.
