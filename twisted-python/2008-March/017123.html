Having contributed the replacement laptop, I've got the &quot;official&quot;
working code from Teach Me Twisted.  I'd be happy to send it to you,
Steve, or anyone else who wants to blog on the session.  One caveat: the
laptop I had with me at python belongs to my employer, so it's sitting
in my office right now, and I won't be able to get to it until Monday.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Next year, we should definitely have more regular Twisted talks; I'd say 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that someone else should do another &quot;teach me twisted&quot; session, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't know if anyone else has the raw charisma and pedagogical expertise 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that Mr. Holden combined with Twisted ignorance to make this session so 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; great :).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't forget the whisky ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Believe me, I won't. ;) Actually I think the whisky was a minor but
essential ingredient in making the event as fantastic as it was.  Just
having the bottle sitting up front was a good reminder to people that we
were there because we think this stuff is fun.  It took a lot of the
formality off of the learning process, and that informality helped
people get excited about the endeavor.


&gt;<i> What we possibly need first of all is for someone to do a &quot;Teach Me 
</I>&gt;<i> Teach Me&quot; in the tutorial track, with myself and a number of the more 
</I>&gt;<i> experienced trainer types as the &quot;subject matter experts&quot;. These things 
</I>&gt;<i> are always one-off in nature and it's unrealistic to expect that they 
</I>&gt;<i> will all have the same charm as &quot;Teach Me Twisted&quot; did this year for all 
</I>&gt;<i> the reasons I mention above, but if it gets information out more 
</I>&gt;<i> effectively about &quot;difficult&quot; topics it's probably worth a try if we can 
</I>&gt;<i> find someone to facilitate them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'd love to try my hand at &quot;teach me&quot; style teaching, for what it's
worth, and would be interested in a Teach Me Teach Me session.

&gt;<i> regards
</I>&gt;<i>   Steve
