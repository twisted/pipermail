Hope the new laptop is behaving itself ...

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> don't know if anyone else has the raw charisma and pedagogical expertise 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that Mr. Holden combined with Twisted ignorance to make this session so 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> great :).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Don't forget the whisky ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Believe me, I won't. ;) Actually I think the whisky was a minor but

</I>&gt;<i> formality off of the learning process, and that informality helped
</I>&gt;<i> people get excited about the endeavor.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What we possibly need first of all is for someone to do a &quot;Teach Me 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Teach Me&quot; in the tutorial track, with myself and a number of the more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experienced trainer types as the &quot;subject matter experts&quot;. These things 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are always one-off in nature and it's unrealistic to expect that they 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will all have the same charm as &quot;Teach Me Twisted&quot; did this year for all

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd love to try my hand at &quot;teach me&quot; style teaching, for what it's
</I>&gt;<i> worth, and would be interested in a Teach Me Teach Me session.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Maybe you could facilitate it?
