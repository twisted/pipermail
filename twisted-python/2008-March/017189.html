<PRE>Hi Justin:

&gt;<i> Too much serialization, even accidental
</I>&gt;<i>serialization, trades comprehensibility for
</I>&gt;<i>performance.  I think that's a reasonable place
</I>&gt;<i>to  start: make your system easy to understand, then
</I>&gt;<i>make it fast once you know what's going on.
</I>
JW&gt;How does the saying go? &quot;Premature optimisation is
JW&gt;the root of all evil&quot;?

Butler Lampson in the paper &quot;Hints for Computer System
Design&quot; saids &quot;Get it right! Neither abstraction nor
simplicity is a substitute for getting it right.&quot; 

I think if there is a tao of Twisted, its tenets would
be performance and getting it right.

A part of getting things right, is knowing what wrong
looks like. Both Twisted and (Stackless - what I work
with), don't dedicate much time to showing what is
definitely wrong.

&gt;<i>The easiest place to start learning is with code that
</I>&gt;<i>looks like all the other code you've written before. 
</I>
I am not sure about this approach although there is
much to be said about having a programming style that
makes you feel confident to tackle problems. 

I find a good way to learn is looking at good but
simple examples that do something useful, then tinker
with them. This is the way some of my favourite
computer books work - the various
Kernighan/Richie/Plauger books, Steven's &quot;Unix Network
Programming&quot;

In the case of Twisted, I found the Abe Fettig book
good - I looked at webcat.py and requesthandler.py and
that gave me a start. From time to time, I also posted
on this mailing list to get little examples - very
helpful. 

I also like the design patterns approach to learning:
this is the name, the situation/context, the problem,
the solution, references. 

I think Twisted would benefit from this approach when
one is dealing with common situations like say &quot;call
database from request handler&quot; or &quot;separate business
logic from network logic.&quot;


Cheers,
Andrew
