Subject: [Twisted-Python] TODO/FIXME/XXX comments
Message-ID: <CAFycZ9ef3sxH+LB3njDghYww14Gh8EwEVLCs7pWE9Ud5SGPK0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The coding standard contains:

"Comments marked with XXX or TODO must contain a reference to the
associated ticket."

-----

Are there more hints about how to write XXX/TODO comments or how not
to write them?

Instead of

XXX: If the client makes arbitrary CTCP queries,
this method should probably show the responses to
them instead of treating them as anomalies.

is this new comment better?

 FIXME:7560:
 Add code for handling arbitrary queries and not treat them as
 anomalies.

------

Maybe  we can update the styleguide with an example of a bad TODO
comment and a god TODO comment.

---------

For my project I use a specific marker for TODO comments so that it
much easier to automate some checks.. (ex no comments for closed
tickets are left in the code) or provide a list with
TODO/tech-debt tickets.


What do you think?

Yes, this is much better, but better still would be simply:

# FIXME: https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7560 <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7560>

The actual guidance should probably be changed to say to include an actual hyperlink to the ticket, so that if we migrate to a new bug tracker (an imminent possibility with so much interest in switching to Git and then Github) we can keep all the references current by setting up URL redirects.

Also, there's rarely a point to putting a copy of the bug's description in the code; that should be kept up to date in the bug tracker and not duplicated.

OK. I will try to work on this and we can discuss in the review.

I find it useful to have a few words describing why the fixme comment is there.
So I don't have to constantly hit the internet while I am reading twisted code.

I know that ticket description might change, but the comment should
state the reason why the fixme was created... an this should not
change.

The FIXME comment should be brief and it does not need to be the full
description.

I will try to do this.

Maybe, first we should move Specifications (as there is only one spec)

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/specifications/banana.html

and Development of Twisted (as there are only small pages)

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/index.html

This should make it much easier to update development documentation
and have development documentation in a single place.

What do you think?
I can take care of creating tickets  and submitting packages.

Message-ID: <CAFycZ9dP412YfE5D5N0KL4+TkUA6isTQ=AKoK6t0vYs1C81SJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is this wiki page still valid?

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Windows

I saw that it was not updated in the last 5 years.

I think that latest Visual Studio license is free to use for open
source projects.

My project/company can donate virtual machines. We will host them and
our sysadmin will take care of their uptime.

We have a Proliant G5 2xQuad Core Xeon server which is idle at our UK
office. It has UPS and dedicated RAID batteries.

We have donated 2 Linux VMs in the past but they were never used, so
we have stop them.

We can provide license for Windows 8.1 and Windows 2012 Server as part of a
Microsoft Partner Network licensing scheme.
We don't have XP, Vista, Win7 licenses.

Cheers,

Yes, it's totally out of date.  We should probably just delete the page.

This is true.  Unfortunately this is not adequate for a Twisted build environment.

Python 2.7 was built against Visual Studio 2008, which means you need a copy of VS2K8 to build extensions.

Microsoft has released <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266 <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266>> to make this easier for people who are not professional developers.  Unfortunately this download is not quite adequate, because it does not include all the headers that are necessary for, for example, building pywin32.  My pypiwin32 build <https://warehouse.python.org/project/pypiwin32/ <https://warehouse.python.org/project/pypiwin32/>> will hopefully alleviate this problem, but to have a from-scratch environment as one would want for a buildbot (especially since we may need to be responsible for automated builds of pypiwin32 itself) we still need full developer tools and not just the restricted free stuff.

> My project/company can donate virtual machines. We will host them and

Would you be able to provide external administrative access so that members of the project can access and maintain it as necessary?  We have had a recurring problem with donated hosting resources, even those with overall very good uptime, being inaccessible at critical times, such as sprints.

> We have a Proliant G5 2xQuad Core Xeon server which is idle at our UK

Is that machine running a hypervisor or host OS we could have access to?  More donated hardware frees up our existing donated hardware and cloud resources to run other things :).

> We have donated 2 Linux VMs in the past but they were never used, so
> we have stop them.

Really, the most serious problem we have is a lack of administrative / operational resources, less so than hardware.  Don't get me wrong, hardware is useful!  But a couple of hours of a sysadmin's time every month would be even more so, because that would let us actually use all the servers that folks have offered :).

Thanks, I appreciate it.  However, Microsoft has granted the Twisted project an MSDN account in the past, so we were able to acquire the necessary licenses; if we needed more licenses I'm pretty sure we could get them.  (Also, we tend to care about the versions of Windows that people actually have installed on client machines, since the most important goal of Twisted running on Windows is to make sure it runs on clients "in the wild"; running on servers is a fine side-effect, but XP and Win7 are the most interesting versions from that perspective.)

Message-ID: <00A8D2CB-A1A3-496F-8670-E9888990F3E6@twistedmatrix.com>

A few months ago, the question of an official process for obtaining commit access was raised.

The discussion lead to this proposal - https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Proposal/ContributorAdvancementPath <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Proposal/ContributorAdvancementPath>.  I like that proposal, but it is still incomplete: to wit, it defines a template for how roles might be defined but does not actually define any roles.  It also seems to be a bit overly ambitious, just from the observed reaction of nobody having the time to implement it :).

So I have a proposal for a scaled back process that nevertheless would give us something official-ish:

Not all committers are actively involved in the project at all times, so we should form a "committer committee" of people who are interested in evaluating candidates.  If you would like to do that and you're already a committer, please contact me and I'll add you to the list.  I want to do this so there's somewhere to apply to which isn't just a public mailing list or discussion, since public discussions can create social pressure to grant someone commit just to be nice, and rejections might be perceived as mean.

Candidates should submit an application to this new list, commit at twistedmatrix.com <mailto:commit at twistedmatrix.com> which is a list of links to at least 10 tickets, at least 5 of which are patches they've submitted, and at least 5 of which are code reviews they've done which have been accepted by a committer.  At least 2 of their authored patches should have gone all the way through the process to be landed.

As with the other parts of our process, if there is at least one sponsor, and no objections from anyone on the committee within 7 days, any member of the committee may add the committer.

New committers should then be announced on the mailing list.

This is not really an ideal process - particularly, it lacks a good way to give contributors something specific and useful to do - but it's something at least.  If there is general assent that this is an improvement, I'll go make a wiki page and a mailing list.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Retiring buildslaves
Message-ID: <CAMcKhMT02XTzYNSBCemKRsWJJAzj5_G_hF+ftbtQ6ihY=U2_Bw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi buildbot infrastructure maintainers,

I am intending to retire my buildslaves (bot-idnar-debian and
bot-idnar-debian64) upon release of jessie (Debian 8.0). The proximate
cause for this is planned changes for the machines currently hosting
the slaves; but given the current situation of Twisted's buildslave
infrastructure, I don't think they're providing much value at this
point, so restoring them after my infrastructure changes doesn't seem
worth it.

I took a look at the buildmaster configuration, however I couldn't
really figure out how to unentangle them since they're currently only
being used for somewhat esoteric builders. Can someone else figure
this out for me? ;)

Glyph,

I support this idea. I like the fact that it gives a clear goal (5 submitted patches, 5 reviews, and 2 accepted submissions) towards which people interested in committing can work.

Message-ID: <CAFycZ9fF8m3M_JWRTQgRxZtgr2WZaLsVo_bC5QEb0zTsyuu-6A@mail.gmail.com>

I have updated the Twisted Development page with a section describing
how to create a dev environment.

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedDevelopment#Creatingyourworkenvironment

Feel free to update or remove it.

------

>From previous discussions the direction was that new persons
contributing to Twisted should already know how to build a dev/work
environment and we should not instruct them how or what to do.

With the addition of setup.py optional component I find it useful to
remind developers about the optional dev component... so I have
updated the wiki page.

I would go further and instruct developers not to use the
pyflakes/pylint versions provided by the OS as they might be old or
too new for twistedchecker :)

I am not a supporter of private discussions for public projects... but
I am ok with having something.
I agree that Twisted general discussion
Open source contributors should take a rejection as an opportunity to improve.
Open source maintainer should not accept patches or add new
contributors just to be nice.

I would say that we should ask for 5 patches which were merged.
I find that 2 patches are too few.
Also 2 patches for cleanup jobs are fine, but I don't think that they
are enough.

Should be a start and much better than current process.

As soon as the committee is in place I will apply for commit rights to
practice the process and also validate that I deserve the commit
right.
Meanwhile I will start recording my activity.

For new contributors, I suggest that they can create a wiki page to
keep track of the tickets.

I have no idea how you can use Trac report to give you a list of
tickets you have reviewer or you have contributed patches to.

------

Since some Twisted related project are on GitHub it would be nice to
discuss some direction about how to get edit rights for those
projects.

Thanks!

Thanks for the info,
Maybe it should go as an update to
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/WindowsBuilds#OFFICIAL

Looks like current wiki page is out of date.. it talks about python 2.4 and 2.5

I have in plan to build Twisted from scratch for Windows so I can
validate the wiki page and maybe update it.

For now, we can only provide root access to the VMs and not to the

I understand and I am fully aware of the effort required to maintain
the infrastructure.
I can help with the buildbot as I maintain a multi-OS / multi-project
buildbot installation
for my project with more than 20 slaves and lot of builders on each slave.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Run Twisted reactor from a Thread
Message-ID: <CALuxc6rzAGkTghCpVEDawghJZC13etWut7rv-Sdu7pF+tmDPHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello;

When i run reactor from thread in a synchrone python program, the twisted
code is never called.

To resolve this problem, I had to put a sleep.

def _reactor_thread(self):
    if not self.reactor.running:
        self.reactor.run(installSignalHandlers=0)


def _start_thread( self ):

    self.client_thread = Thread( target=self._reactor_thread,
                                 name="mine" )
    self.client_thread.setDaemon(True)
    self.client_thread.start()
    from time import sleep
    sleep( 0.5 )

What is the best way to do it, instead of calling sleep?


Thank you.

If you can, check out Crochet. It wraps up most of the mess involved in
making this work, and vastly simpliies the experience..

In case Crochet is does not you maybe you can use
addSystemEventTrigger with 'startup' and 'after' to have a something
called after startup.

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/14.0.0/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorCore.html#addSystemEventTrigger

When you want to stop the reactor, make sure you call it from the
right thread using reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop)
You can use addSystemEventTrigger to hook into the reactor shutdow process.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I'm pleased to announce txtorcon 0.12.0. Full list of improvements:

 * doc, code and import cleanups from Kali Kaneko
 * HiddenServiceDirGroupReadable support
 * Issue #80: honour "ControlPort 0" in incoming TorConfig
   instance. The caller owns both pieces: you have to figure out when
   it's bootstraped, and are responsible for killing it off.
 * Issue #88: clarify documentation and fix appending to some config lists
 * If GeoIP data isn't loaded in Tor, it sends protocol errors; if
   txtorcon also hasn't got GeoIP data, the queries for country-code
   fail; this error is now ignored.
 * 100% unit-test coverage!
 * PyPy support (as in: all tests pass)
 * TCP4HiddenServiceEndpoint now waits for descriptor upload before
   the listen() call does its callback (this means when using "onion:"
   endpoint strings, or any of the endpoints APIs your hidden service
   is 100% ready for action when you receive the callback)
 * "TorControlProtocol now has an ".all_routers" member, which is a set() of all Routers
 * TimeIntervalCommaList from Tor config supported
 * documentation fix from "sammyshj"

You can download the release from PyPI or GitHub (or of
course "pip install txtorcon"):

   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txtorcon/0.12.0
   https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon/releases/tag/v0.12.0

As a general rule I would agree with these sentiments, but generally, open projects are discussing specific bits of code.  In this case, we're talking about actually evaluating people as worthy or unworthy of commit access.

> Open source contributors should take a rejection as an opportunity to improve.

Sure, we accept this as part of the normal review process.  And we accept it here as well, as part of a private discussion.  But it is hard to accept public shaming as an opportunity to improve.  Private feedback is much easier to give, and it is much easier for the contributor to take.

> Open source maintainer should not accept patches or add new contributors just to be nice.

We do not have trouble rejecting patches, because we are able to keep the focus entirely on the patch, because that is what is being evaluated, and not the contributor.  Of course here the focus should be entirely on the work too, but it is hard enough to keep the discussion centered that way in code review :).

> I would say that we should ask for 5 patches which were merged.

This is more of a minimum; if they are 2 substantial patches, that seems like more than enough.  But the committee reserves the right to say "this is not enough significant work".

That sounds like a great idea.

I'm not sure if external contributors have enough access to the SQL.  Maybe we can make a report that queries the database directly rather than going through trac, like <http://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/>.

I think we should probably follow the same process; the main question is whether each project should have its own set of core reviewers.  I honestly don't have an idea for that :).

Thanks for updating this!  Virtualenv is definitely an easier way to get set up, especially for optional dependencies.  I notice you've got it set up with the fancy new feature from #3696 ;).

The one issue I have with this is that it is UNIX-specific; in a Windows shell, the "." syntax won't work to source the relevant file.  But perhaps if a Windows user complains we can figure out what a reasonable setup is there :).

The major blocker to be able to make progress on the build infrastructure sensibly is that right now you need to make changes to master on github in order to do development: <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/70 <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/70>>.  If you could submit some PRs to Braid to make all the service repositories get pushed rather than pulled, we could more easily make a staging or local development environment setup: <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/75 <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/75>>.

So if you had some time to work on the dev infrastructure that's where to start :).

Thanks,

Why not just link to the (very good) virtualenv setup instructions, and
then explain the extra bits used here? By "extra bits" I mean the -e -U
".[dev]" part.

Feel free to add a link.
I was assuming that Twisted developer already know about all those
things and have already read the documentation of virtualenv / pip
and  the new documentation of Twisted installation process.

The code snippet from there is just a reminder :)

I used the git log / email search to compile current data... but I
assume that candidates will
update the wiki page in an incremental way.

The enhancement ticket type is a bit to generic for this purpose...
but I prefer to keep ticket metadata simple  and maybe candidates can
set some tags to help with queries.

https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/windows7-64-py2.7/builds/4147/steps/select/logs/problems

they talk about 4 errors, but I can only see one.

The log is full of non-problem info like skip and todo, so I tried to
search for "[ERROR]" string

How can I find the other errors?

Is there a way to see the log only with the problems? Ignoring
skipped/toto test?


Thanks!

I?d be interested in this :)

I think this also might be a good time to move it to the twisted/ org alongside Klein, maybe?

Yes, we should discuss this.  getPage should be deprecated and treq should be pulled in.  Twisted is not a place packages go to die like the stdlib (although the barrier should be lower still).

That was klein, not treq. Other side of the HTTP client/server pair ;)

Maybe! Treq has a nice API.

Failures and errors are always at the end of the log.

You see one traceback, but it is responsible for 4 errors - that is, 4 tests produced the same traceback.  You can see all of their names below the traceback; to wit:

twisted.internet.test.test_inotify.TestINotify.test_deleteSelf
twisted.internet.test.test_inotify.TestINotify.test_ignoreFilePath
twisted.internet.test.test_inotify.TestINotify.test_seriesOfWatchAndIgnore
twisted.internet.test.test_inotify.TestINotify.test_simpleDeleteDirectory

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Development documentation in Trac wiki
Message-ID: <CAFycZ9dqZjCn_RsuViQ80Up4HVtByxTiifL+YfimAeuamDpfpg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to talk about moving Twisted development documentation out of
official Twisted doc.

They can be moved either into the Trac wiki or a separate project ...
maybe twisted-dev-tools

The problem with Twisted main repo is that (AFAIK) updates are done
only after a release... so I change might be delay quite a lot (6
months)

We already have a lot of info inside the Trac wiki..

My plan it to move the following docs into Trac and organize existing
specification and development wiki pages:

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/specifications/index.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/specifications/banana.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/index.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/naming.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/philosophy.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/security.html

I would also move the following docs to Trac so that they can be
updated much faster.

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/svn-dev.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/index.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/coding-standard.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/writing-standard.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/test-standard.html

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/doc-standard.html
Do we still use XHTML ?

Trac support RST format, so we can maintain those pages in RST... and
trac wiki allow to view changes as diffs.

Having docs in repo is nice as you can send them for review, but i
feel that this is counter-productive for the current case.

What do you think?

Thanks!

Here are my improvements:

https://github.com/twisted/twisted-dev-tools/pull/8

Please, please merge
https://github.com/twisted/twisted-dev-tools/pull/4 or
https://github.com/twisted/twisted-dev-tools/pull/7

----------

I also wanted to update the tools to show status in command line and
run a specific test/tests just like you would run trial on local
system (without -b) ... but for next ticket.

For my project I have a similar tool which just runs a background
thread and pipes the output of last builbot web status log into the
console.
It is ok for test which take a few second, but for test that take
40minutes I found email notifications much useful.

Cheers

The coding standard really shouldn't be changing so frequently that this 
is a major concern.  Additionally, everyone who is developing Twisted 
has a Twisted checkout with the most recent version of the information 
anyway.

Also, releases *should* be happening more frequently than every six 
months.

This doesn't seem like a very compelling reason to make this change.

This is already done, after a fashion.  https://twisted.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ <https://twisted.readthedocs.org/en/latest/> is generated after each commit, as part of the sync to github, as you can see here: https://readthedocs.org/builds/twisted/?fromdocs=twisted

Our buildbot also builds the docs (with the website stylesheet) after each commit, it just doesn't give them a stable URL.

How does one enable RST formatting in trac?  I don't love RST but it would certainly be a better source format than trac-wiki syntax.

I'd prefer to go the opposite direction, and take all the policy documents on the wiki and put them into the repository.  Originally, the intention of putting stuff on the wiki was to have a rough draft for something that was not official, but would become so when it went through code review and went into the repository.

Right now many changes to these de-facto official policies happen with only a cursory mailing list discussion, so they don't necessarily reflect the consensus process that we have designed for code.

It's worth noting that CompatibilityPolicy is still provisional because our code still emits warnings, and we should fix those :-).

I'm pleased to announce the release of Axiom 0.7.3. Axiom is an
in-process object-relational database for Python, built on SQLite.

This release is a bug fix release to correct another important issue;
anyone using Axiom on PyPy should upgrade as soon as possible to avoid
potential data loss in their application. For more information on this

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Using ldapbindingchecker (part of ldaptor) with
	Twisted.
Message-ID: <54D222D3.43E4.0037.1@novell.com>


I am looking for any examples of using the ldapbindingchecker to authenticate a custom SSH Server written with Twisted and Python 2.7. At the moment I am trying to hack an existing SSHD example in the Twisted O'Reilly book.  The docs refer to a "cfg" but I cannot find where it discusses what CFG actually is ?



I seem to need a service account to authenticate with the ldapbindingchecker so I can decide my user accound and password are valid over ldap. Where is this defined and what is the format ? I have found the global.cfg file and that gets me part of the way there but effectively I still cannot set a password. Can anyone help ?

I've yet to really dig into the code in that area of Ldaptor yet, but I
believe this might be what you want:

ldapChecker = LDAPBindingChecker(ldaptor.config.LDAPConfig())
p.registerChecker(ldapChecker)

or

cfg = LDAPConfig()
checker = LDAPBindingChecker(cfg)
realm = TODOGetRidOfMeRealm(config=cfg)
porta = portal.Portal(realm)
porta.registerChecker(checkers.AllowAnonymousAccess(),
credentials.IAnonymous)
porta.registerChecker(checker)

http://ldaptor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_modules/ldaptor/checkers.html
seems to indicate that you need to pass in your credentials. There are a
few TODO items in here as well.

I hope this gets you started into a better direction! I hope there are
others that can chime in as well

Message-ID: <CA+2gYipgCq5qRq5n0jgOTcqyEajk-RCjsFSBZrPomtR+VH_hpg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

A few days ago, Mr. glyph asked me to work on ticket 7775 (<
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7775>). However, I had a couple of
questions and I posted them in a ticket comment. After waiting for a couple
of days, I was on #twisted-dev and Mr. adiroiban advised me to post my
query to the mailing list instead as it would reach more people, hence,
this email.

Here is a link to the comment on the ticket: <
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7775#comment:1>

It would really mean a lot to me if someone could go through my comment and
give me some guidance so that I can start working on this ticket. :-)

Thanks a lot for letting me be a part of this amazing community! It is a
huge honor for me to learn from all of you!

Regards,
Eeshan Garg

Hi,

I need to loosen up the default cipher list to allow RC4 (some sites
our customers use like myaccounts.socalgas.com still use it).

I was going to pass the following dict into the
extraCertificateOptions argument of ssl.optionsForClientTLS, but was
curious if there as a better way:

{"acceptableCiphers" : <IAcceptableCiphers object>}

As the documentation for extraCertificateOptions says, if you need to use it it's a bug in the interface.  As such, please file it :-).  This escape-hatch was presented specifically so we could discover which features of that interface were really necessary customizations and which were just unfortunate compromises with OpenSSL's API.

In this case, no, there's no other way to get acceptable ciphers in there, and this should probably just be added to optionsForClientTLS.

Another reasonable fix might be to allow RC4, since I think the default cipher suites that we have selected might be more appropriate for servers than for clients; the major browsers will still negotiate RC4 so we might want a slightly more permissive list.  Hopefully someone more cryptographically enlightened than I am can opine as to whether this is a reasonable thing to do in 2015...

Will do. Saw that note but wanted to make sure I wasn't missing a
better approach before filing a bug.

I'd advocate for adding the acceptableCiphers argument to
optionsForClientTLS over loosening the default cipher list. I think
having a secure default and making loosening that default an explicit
action is a good behavior. That way a less secure cipher list is
always an active choice.

I saw that on Firefox's wiki, but in reality Firefox 35 still does
allow RC4: http://www.screencast.com/t/AuMRylAV

I?m still maintaining that watering down the defaults is an invitation 
to downgrade attacks that affect *everyone*.  And RC4 looks worse with 
every month passing.

IIUC, Firefox 36 will only allow RC4 as a fallback (but not disable it
completely), and I think there is talk about disabling RC4 completely
for TLS 1.1/1.2.

OK.  This is precisely why I didn't want to make this call myself :).

Message-ID: <CAFycZ9ef3sxH+LB3njDghYww14Gh8EwEVLCs7pWE9Ud5SGPK0w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The coding standard contains:

"Comments marked with XXX or TODO must contain a reference to the
associated ticket."

-----

Are there more hints about how to write XXX/TODO comments or how not
to write them?

Instead of

XXX: If the client makes arbitrary CTCP queries,
this method should probably show the responses to
them instead of treating them as anomalies.

is this new comment better?

 FIXME:7560:
 Add code for handling arbitrary queries and not treat them as
 anomalies.

------

Maybe  we can update the styleguide with an example of a bad TODO
comment and a god TODO comment.

---------

For my project I use a specific marker for TODO comments so that it
much easier to automate some checks.. (ex no comments for closed
tickets are left in the code) or provide a list with
TODO/tech-debt tickets.


What do you think?

Yes, this is much better, but better still would be simply:

# FIXME: https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7560 <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7560>

The actual guidance should probably be changed to say to include an actual hyperlink to the ticket, so that if we migrate to a new bug tracker (an imminent possibility with so much interest in switching to Git and then Github) we can keep all the references current by setting up URL redirects.

Also, there's rarely a point to putting a copy of the bug's description in the code; that should be kept up to date in the bug tracker and not duplicated.

OK. I will try to work on this and we can discuss in the review.

I find it useful to have a few words describing why the fixme comment is there.
So I don't have to constantly hit the internet while I am reading twisted code.

I know that ticket description might change, but the comment should
state the reason why the fixme was created... an this should not
change.

The FIXME comment should be brief and it does not need to be the full
description.

I will try to do this.

Maybe, first we should move Specifications (as there is only one spec)

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/specifications/banana.html

and Development of Twisted (as there are only small pages)

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/index.html

This should make it much easier to update development documentation
and have development documentation in a single place.

What do you think?
I can take care of creating tickets  and submitting packages.

Message-ID: <CAFycZ9dP412YfE5D5N0KL4+TkUA6isTQ=AKoK6t0vYs1C81SJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is this wiki page still valid?

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Windows

I saw that it was not updated in the last 5 years.

I think that latest Visual Studio license is free to use for open
source projects.

My project/company can donate virtual machines. We will host them and
our sysadmin will take care of their uptime.

We have a Proliant G5 2xQuad Core Xeon server which is idle at our UK
office. It has UPS and dedicated RAID batteries.

We have donated 2 Linux VMs in the past but they were never used, so
we have stop them.

We can provide license for Windows 8.1 and Windows 2012 Server as part of a
Microsoft Partner Network licensing scheme.
We don't have XP, Vista, Win7 licenses.

Cheers,

Yes, it's totally out of date.  We should probably just delete the page.

This is true.  Unfortunately this is not adequate for a Twisted build environment.

Python 2.7 was built against Visual Studio 2008, which means you need a copy of VS2K8 to build extensions.

Microsoft has released <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266 <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266>> to make this easier for people who are not professional developers.  Unfortunately this download is not quite adequate, because it does not include all the headers that are necessary for, for example, building pywin32.  My pypiwin32 build <https://warehouse.python.org/project/pypiwin32/ <https://warehouse.python.org/project/pypiwin32/>> will hopefully alleviate this problem, but to have a from-scratch environment as one would want for a buildbot (especially since we may need to be responsible for automated builds of pypiwin32 itself) we still need full developer tools and not just the restricted free stuff.

> My project/company can donate virtual machines. We will host them and

Would you be able to provide external administrative access so that members of the project can access and maintain it as necessary?  We have had a recurring problem with donated hosting resources, even those with overall very good uptime, being inaccessible at critical times, such as sprints.

Is that machine running a hypervisor or host OS we could have access to?  More donated hardware frees up our existing donated hardware and cloud resources to run other things :).

> we have stop them.

Really, the most serious problem we have is a lack of administrative / operational resources, less so than hardware.  Don't get me wrong, hardware is useful!  But a couple of hours of a sysadmin's time every month would be even more so, because that would let us actually use all the servers that folks have offered :).

Thanks, I appreciate it.  However, Microsoft has granted the Twisted project an MSDN account in the past, so we were able to acquire the necessary licenses; if we needed more licenses I'm pretty sure we could get them.  (Also, we tend to care about the versions of Windows that people actually have installed on client machines, since the most important goal of Twisted running on Windows is to make sure it runs on clients "in the wild"; running on servers is a fine side-effect, but XP and Win7 are the most interesting versions from that perspective.)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] revisiting onboarding
Message-ID: <00A8D2CB-A1A3-496F-8670-E9888990F3E6@twistedmatrix.com>

A few months ago, the question of an official process for obtaining commit access was raised.

The discussion lead to this proposal - https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Proposal/ContributorAdvancementPath <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Proposal/ContributorAdvancementPath>.  I like that proposal, but it is still incomplete: to wit, it defines a template for how roles might be defined but does not actually define any roles.  It also seems to be a bit overly ambitious, just from the observed reaction of nobody having the time to implement it :).

So I have a proposal for a scaled back process that nevertheless would give us something official-ish:

Not all committers are actively involved in the project at all times, so we should form a "committer committee" of people who are interested in evaluating candidates.  If you would like to do that and you're already a committer, please contact me and I'll add you to the list.  I want to do this so there's somewhere to apply to which isn't just a public mailing list or discussion, since public discussions can create social pressure to grant someone commit just to be nice, and rejections might be perceived as mean.

Candidates should submit an application to this new list, commit at twistedmatrix.com <mailto:commit at twistedmatrix.com> which is a list of links to at least 10 tickets, at least 5 of which are patches they've submitted, and at least 5 of which are code reviews they've done which have been accepted by a committer.  At least 2 of their authored patches should have gone all the way through the process to be landed.

As with the other parts of our process, if there is at least one sponsor, and no objections from anyone on the committee within 7 days, any member of the committee may add the committer.

New committers should then be announced on the mailing list.

This is not really an ideal process - particularly, it lacks a good way to give contributors something specific and useful to do - but it's something at least.  If there is general assent that this is an improvement, I'll go make a wiki page and a mailing list.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Retiring buildslaves
Message-ID: <CAMcKhMT02XTzYNSBCemKRsWJJAzj5_G_hF+ftbtQ6ihY=U2_Bw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi buildbot infrastructure maintainers,

I am intending to retire my buildslaves (bot-idnar-debian and
bot-idnar-debian64) upon release of jessie (Debian 8.0). The proximate
cause for this is planned changes for the machines currently hosting
the slaves; but given the current situation of Twisted's buildslave
infrastructure, I don't think they're providing much value at this
point, so restoring them after my infrastructure changes doesn't seem
worth it.

I took a look at the buildmaster configuration, however I couldn't
really figure out how to unentangle them since they're currently only
being used for somewhat esoteric builders. Can someone else figure
this out for me? ;)

Glyph,

I support this idea. I like the fact that it gives a clear goal (5 submitted patches, 5 reviews, and 2 accepted submissions) towards which people interested in committing can work.

environment and we should not instruct them how or what to do.

With the addition of setup.py optional component I find it useful to
remind developers about the optional dev component... so I have
updated the wiki page.

I would go further and instruct developers not to use the
pyflakes/pylint versions provided by the OS as they might be old or
too new for twistedchecker :)

I am not a supporter of private discussions for public projects... but
I am ok with having something.
I agree that Twisted general discussion
Open source contributors should take a rejection as an opportunity to improve.
Open source maintainer should not accept patches or add new
contributors just to be nice.

I would say that we should ask for 5 patches which were merged.
I find that 2 patches are too few.
Also 2 patches for cleanup jobs are fine, but I don't think that they
are enough.

Should be a start and much better than current process.

As soon as the committee is in place I will apply for commit rights to
practice the process and also validate that I deserve the commit
right.
Meanwhile I will start recording my activity.

For new contributors, I suggest that they can create a wiki page to
keep track of the tickets.

I have no idea how you can use Trac report to give you a list of
tickets you have reviewer or you have contributed patches to.

------

Since some Twisted related project are on GitHub it would be nice to
discuss some direction about how to get edit rights for those
projects.

Thanks!

Thanks for the info,
Maybe it should go as an update to
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/WindowsBuilds#OFFICIAL

Looks like current wiki page is out of date.. it talks about python 2.4 and 2.5

I have in plan to build Twisted from scratch for Windows so I can
validate the wiki page and maybe update it.

I understand and I am fully aware of the effort required to maintain
the infrastructure.
I can help with the buildbot as I maintain a multi-OS / multi-project
buildbot installation
for my project with more than 20 slaves and lot of builders on each slave.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Run Twisted reactor from a Thread
Message-ID: <CALuxc6rzAGkTghCpVEDawghJZC13etWut7rv-Sdu7pF+tmDPHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello;

When i run reactor from thread in a synchrone python program, the twisted
code is never called.

To resolve this problem, I had to put a sleep.

def _reactor_thread(self):
    if not self.reactor.running:
        self.reactor.run(installSignalHandlers=0)


def _start_thread( self ):

    self.client_thread = Thread( target=self._reactor_thread,
                                 name="mine" )
    self.client_thread.setDaemon(True)
    self.client_thread.start()
    from time import sleep
    sleep( 0.5 )

What is the best way to do it, instead of calling sleep?


Thank you.

If you can, check out Crochet. It wraps up most of the mess involved in

In case Crochet is does not you maybe you can use
addSystemEventTrigger with 'startup' and 'after' to have a something
called after startup.

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/14.0.0/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorCore.html#addSystemEventTrigger

When you want to stop the reactor, make sure you call it from the
right thread using reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop)
You can use addSystemEventTrigger to hook into the reactor shutdow process.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I'm pleased to announce txtorcon 0.12.0. Full list of improvements:

 * doc, code and import cleanups from Kali Kaneko
 * HiddenServiceDirGroupReadable support
 * Issue #80: honour "ControlPort 0" in incoming TorConfig
   instance. The caller owns both pieces: you have to figure out when
   it's bootstraped, and are responsible for killing it off.
 * Issue #88: clarify documentation and fix appending to some config lists
 * If GeoIP data isn't loaded in Tor, it sends protocol errors; if
   txtorcon also hasn't got GeoIP data, the queries for country-code
   fail; this error is now ignored.
 * 100% unit-test coverage!
 * PyPy support (as in: all tests pass)
 * TCP4HiddenServiceEndpoint now waits for descriptor upload before
   the listen() call does its callback (this means when using "onion:"
   endpoint strings, or any of the endpoints APIs your hidden service
   is 100% ready for action when you receive the callback)
 * "TorControlProtocol now has an ".all_routers" member, which is a set() of all Routers
 * TimeIntervalCommaList from Tor config supported
 * documentation fix from "sammyshj"

You can download the release from PyPI or GitHub (or of
course "pip install txtorcon"):

   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txtorcon/0.12.0
   https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon/releases/tag/v0.12.0

As a general rule I would agree with these sentiments, but generally, open projects are discussing specific bits of code.  In this case, we're talking about actually evaluating people as worthy or unworthy of commit access.

> Open source contributors should take a rejection as an opportunity to improve.

Sure, we accept this as part of the normal review process.  And we accept it here as well, as part of a private discussion.  But it is hard to accept public shaming as an opportunity to improve.  Private feedback is much easier to give, and it is much easier for the contributor to take.

> Open source maintainer should not accept patches or add new contributors just to be nice.

We do not have trouble rejecting patches, because we are able to keep the focus entirely on the patch, because that is what is being evaluated, and not the contributor.  Of course here the focus should be entirely on the work too, but it is hard enough to keep the discussion centered that way in code review :).

> I would say that we should ask for 5 patches which were merged.
> I find that 2 patches are too few.

This is more of a minimum; if they are 2 substantial patches, that seems like more than enough.  But the committee reserves the right to say "this is not enough significant work".

That sounds like a great idea.

I'm not sure if external contributors have enough access to the SQL.  Maybe we can make a report that queries the database directly rather than going through trac, like <http://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/>.

I think we should probably follow the same process; the main question is whether each project should have its own set of core reviewers.  I honestly don't have an idea for that :).

Thanks for updating this!  Virtualenv is definitely an easier way to get set up, especially for optional dependencies.  I notice you've got it set up with the fancy new feature from #3696 ;).

The one issue I have with this is that it is UNIX-specific; in a Windows shell, the "." syntax won't work to source the relevant file.  But perhaps if a Windows user complains we can figure out what a reasonable setup is there :).

The major blocker to be able to make progress on the build infrastructure sensibly is that right now you need to make changes to master on github in order to do development: <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/70 <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/70>>.  If you could submit some PRs to Braid to make all the service repositories get pushed rather than pulled, we could more easily make a staging or local development environment setup: <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/75 <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/75>>.

So if you had some time to work on the dev infrastructure that's where to start :).

Thanks,

Why not just link to the (very good) virtualenv setup instructions, and
then explain the extra bits used here? By "extra bits" I mean the -e -U
".[dev]" part.

Feel free to add a link.
I was assuming that Twisted developer already know about all those
things and have already read the documentation of virtualenv / pip
and  the new documentation of Twisted installation process.

The code snippet from there is just a reminder :)

I used the git log / email search to compile current data... but I
assume that candidates will
update the wiki page in an incremental way.

The enhancement ticket type is a bit to generic for this purpose...
but I prefer to keep ticket metadata simple  and maybe candidates can
set some tags to help with queries.

Message-ID: <CAFycZ9dBZXBBieG=pcf--NTBeA9VUMH6A11CVZJaUTdHE8Lm6g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I got this "problem" log in builbot

https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/osx10.6-py2.6-select/builds/4868/steps/select/logs/problems

and anothher for Windows

https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/windows7-64-py2.7/builds/4147/steps/select/logs/problems

they talk about 4 errors, but I can only see one.

The log is full of non-problem info like skip and todo, so I tried to
search for "[ERROR]" string

How can I find the other errors?

Is there a way to see the log only with the problems? Ignoring
skipped/toto test?


Thanks!

I’d be interested in this :)

I think this also might be a good time to move it to the twisted/ org alongside Klein, maybe?

Yes, we should discuss this.  getPage should be deprecated and treq should be pulled in.  Twisted is not a place packages go to die like the stdlib (although the barrier should be lower still).

That was klein, not treq. Other side of the HTTP client/server pair ;)

Maybe! Treq has a nice API.

Failures and errors are always at the end of the log.

You see one traceback, but it is responsible for 4 errors - that is, 4 tests produced the same traceback.  You can see all of their names below the traceback; to wit:

twisted.internet.test.test_inotify.TestINotify.test_deleteSelf
twisted.internet.test.test_inotify.TestINotify.test_ignoreFilePath
twisted.internet.test.test_inotify.TestINotify.test_seriesOfWatchAndIgnore
twisted.internet.test.test_inotify.TestINotify.test_simpleDeleteDirectory

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Development documentation in Trac wiki
Message-ID: <CAFycZ9dqZjCn_RsuViQ80Up4HVtByxTiifL+YfimAeuamDpfpg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to talk about moving Twisted development documentation out of
official Twisted doc.

They can be moved either into the Trac wiki or a separate project ...
maybe twisted-dev-tools

The problem with Twisted main repo is that (AFAIK) updates are done
only after a release... so I change might be delay quite a lot (6
months)

We already have a lot of info inside the Trac wiki..

My plan it to move the following docs into Trac and organize existing
specification and development wiki pages:

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/specifications/index.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/specifications/banana.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/index.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/naming.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/philosophy.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/security.html

I would also move the following docs to Trac so that they can be
updated much faster.

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/svn-dev.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/index.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/coding-standard.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/writing-standard.html
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/test-standard.html

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/development/policy/doc-standard.html
Do we still use XHTML ?

Trac support RST format, so we can maintain those pages in RST... and
trac wiki allow to view changes as diffs.

Having docs in repo is nice as you can send them for review, but i
feel that this is counter-productive for the current case.

What do you think?

Thanks!

Here are my improvements:

https://github.com/twisted/twisted-dev-tools/pull/8

Please, please merge
https://github.com/twisted/twisted-dev-tools/pull/4 or
https://github.com/twisted/twisted-dev-tools/pull/7

----------

I also wanted to update the tools to show status in command line and
run a specific test/tests just like you would run trial on local
system (without -b) ... but for next ticket.

For my project I have a similar tool which just runs a background
thread and pipes the output of last builbot web status log into the
console.
It is ok for test which take a few second, but for test that take
40minutes I found email notifications much useful.

Cheers

The coding standard really shouldn't be changing so frequently that this 
is a major concern.  Additionally, everyone who is developing Twisted 
has a Twisted checkout with the most recent version of the information 
anyway.

Also, releases *should* be happening more frequently than every six 
months.

This doesn't seem like a very compelling reason to make this change.

This is already done, after a fashion.  https://twisted.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ <https://twisted.readthedocs.org/en/latest/> is generated after each commit, as part of the sync to github, as you can see here: https://readthedocs.org/builds/twisted/?fromdocs=twisted

Our buildbot also builds the docs (with the website stylesheet) after each commit, it just doesn't give them a stable URL.

How does one enable RST formatting in trac?  I don't love RST but it would certainly be a better source format than trac-wiki syntax.

I'd prefer to go the opposite direction, and take all the policy documents on the wiki and put them into the repository.  Originally, the intention of putting stuff on the wiki was to have a rough draft for something that was not official, but would become so when it went through code review and went into the repository.

Right now many changes to these de-facto official policies happen with only a cursory mailing list discussion, so they don't necessarily reflect the consensus process that we have designed for code.

It's worth noting that CompatibilityPolicy is still provisional because our code still emits warnings, and we should fix those :-).

I'm pleased to announce the release of Axiom 0.7.3. Axiom is an
in-process object-relational database for Python, built on SQLite.

This release is a bug fix release to correct another important issue;
anyone using Axiom on PyPy should upgrade as soon as possible to avoid
potential data loss in their application. For more information on this
bug, see the Github issue[1].

The release is available from PyPi as usual[2], signed with my personal key[3].

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Using ldapbindingchecker (part of ldaptor) with
	Twisted.
Message-ID: <54D222D3.43E4.0037.1@novell.com>


I am looking for any examples of using the ldapbindingchecker to authenticate a custom SSH Server written with Twisted and Python 2.7. At the moment I am trying to hack an existing SSHD example in the Twisted O'Reilly book.  The docs refer to a "cfg" but I cannot find where it discusses what CFG actually is ?



I seem to need a service account to authenticate with the ldapbindingchecker so I can decide my user accound and password are valid over ldap. Where is this defined and what is the format ? I have found the global.cfg file and that gets me part of the way there but effectively I still cannot set a password. Can anyone help ?



Many thanks,

I've yet to really dig into the code in that area of Ldaptor yet, but I
believe this might be what you want:

ldapChecker = LDAPBindingChecker(ldaptor.config.LDAPConfig())
p.registerChecker(ldapChecker)

or

cfg = LDAPConfig()
checker = LDAPBindingChecker(cfg)
realm = TODOGetRidOfMeRealm(config=cfg)
porta = portal.Portal(realm)
porta.registerChecker(checkers.AllowAnonymousAccess(),
credentials.IAnonymous)
porta.registerChecker(checker)

http://ldaptor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_modules/ldaptor/checkers.html
seems to indicate that you need to pass in your credentials. There are a
few TODO items in here as well.

I hope this gets you started into a better direction! I hope there are
others that can chime in as well

Cheers,
Bret

Message-ID: <CA+2gYipgCq5qRq5n0jgOTcqyEajk-RCjsFSBZrPomtR+VH_hpg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

A few days ago, Mr. glyph asked me to work on ticket 7775 (<
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7775>). However, I had a couple of
questions and I posted them in a ticket comment. After waiting for a couple
of days, I was on #twisted-dev and Mr. adiroiban advised me to post my
query to the mailing list instead as it would reach more people, hence,
this email.

Here is a link to the comment on the ticket: <
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7775#comment:1>

It would really mean a lot to me if someone could go through my comment and
give me some guidance so that I can start working on this ticket. :-)

Thanks a lot for letting me be a part of this amazing community! It is a
huge honor for me to learn from all of you!

Regards,
Eeshan Garg

Hi,

I need to loosen up the default cipher list to allow RC4 (some sites

I was going to pass the following dict into the
extraCertificateOptions argument of ssl.optionsForClientTLS, but was

As the documentation for extraCertificateOptions says, if you need to use it it's a bug in the interface.  As such, please file it :-).  This escape-hatch was presented specifically so we could discover which features of that interface were really necessary customizations and which were just unfortunate compromises with OpenSSL's API.

In this case, no, there's no other way to get acceptable ciphers in there, and this should probably just be added to optionsForClientTLS.

Another reasonable fix might be to allow RC4, since I think the default cipher suites that we have selected might be more appropriate for servers than for clients; the major browsers will still negotiate RC4 so we might want a slightly more permissive list.  Hopefully someone more cryptographically enlightened than I am can opine as to whether this is a reasonable thing to do in 2015...

Some browsers won’t — Firefox refuses to use RC4 :)

Will do. Saw that note but wanted to make sure I wasn't missing a
better approach before filing a bug.

I'd advocate for adding the acceptableCiphers argument to
optionsForClientTLS over loosening the default cipher list. I think
having a secure default and making loosening that default an explicit
action is a good behavior. That way a less secure cipher list is
always an active choice.

I saw that on Firefox's wiki, but in reality Firefox 35 still does
allow RC4: http://www.screencast.com/t/AuMRylAV

Yes.

I’m still maintaining that watering down the defaults is an invitation 
to downgrade attacks that affect *everyone*.  And RC4 looks worse with 
every month passing.

IIUC, Firefox 36 will only allow RC4 as a fallback (but not disable it
completely), and I think there is talk about disabling RC4 completely
for TLS 1.1/1.2.

OK.  This is precisely why I didn't want to make this call myself :).

This actually might be because I screwed with my options back when POODLE hit.

Whoops. :D
