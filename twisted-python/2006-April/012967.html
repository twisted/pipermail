I'd bug the mailing list (or possibly IRC channel) for reviewers.
Unfortunately, nagging seems to be a necessarily evil to get your patch heard
sometimes.  I can't speak for all the developers, but I don't mind being nagged
because I realise this.  Well, I don't mind much &lt;wink&gt;.

Also, I think you should unassign the ticket from yourself seeing as there's
nothing for you to do to it at the moment (although this alone isn't likely make
much difference, we just don't have enough people looking over unassigned
issues).  You could try assigning to developers at random (glyph thinks this is
a good idea), but I don't think this really works very well -- e.g. I just spent
over a week not looking at the internet at all, let alone the issue tracker, so
things randomly assigned to me wouldn't have got anywhere.
