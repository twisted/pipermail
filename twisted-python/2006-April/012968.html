<PRE>This is my resignation as Twisted's lead documentation person.

Rest assured I'm not resigning due to any subset of: burning
disillusionment, raging anger, or rampaging untreated mental illness.
Rather, I have a bundle of other projects, and they're increasingly
unrelated to Twisted, which means that I'm not using it for my own
projects, and, sadly, I don't have the energy left over to task switch
into an unrelated project enough to lead part of it.

I'm also, as it turns out, much more interested in reviewing and/or
editing documentation than I am in writing it. The upside of this is
that I'll continue to make myself available as a reviewer of
documentation patches and/or an editor, if needed. Feel free to assign
bugs on this basis. (I will probably not be reading the mailing list,
but I don't make myself difficult to find on IRC.) I will unassign other
bugs from myself soon.

This obviously leaves gaping holes in the greater Twisted universe for
people anxious to advertise the glory of Twisted to the admiring masses.
Do submit some documentation patches... It also leaves a vacancy for
someone who is willing to be caretaker for the documentation as a whole,
fixing minor bugs, farming out work and rearranging things according to
their taste. Apply here, I suspect :)

Thanks,

-Mary
