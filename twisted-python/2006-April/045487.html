<PRE>Hi Matt. Thanks for your answer too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Matt&quot; == Matt Goodall &lt;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">matt at pollenation.net</A>&gt; writes:

</I>
Matt&gt; As you recognised, Twisted uses a select loop so I'm not quite sure what 
Matt&gt; your question means.

You get to it below.

Matt&gt; You will need to understand event driven programming to scale up, 
Matt&gt; otherwise you're likely to block the application from doing more than 
Matt&gt; one thing at a time (in the cooperatively multitasking sense) making 
Matt&gt; your application utterly unscalable.

I'm already a believer, no problem there.

Matt&gt; Also, note that Twisted does not magic away other common problems 
Matt&gt; associated with scalability. The obvious one that springs to mind 
Matt&gt; (because it bit me recently :-/) is the maximum number of file 
Matt&gt; descriptors a non-root Linux process can open per process.

Right - that was what I was referring to originally. Sorry that wasn't
clear.

Matt&gt; There is absolutely a 1-1 relationship between connections and file 
Matt&gt; descriptors but Deferred have nothing to do with it.

OK.

Matt&gt; Hope it did help!

Yes. Plus, it's nice to see how quickly a mailing list reacts when you're
thinking of using a new product :-) Twisted has a bit of a reputation for
being obscure, but it looks much better to me than any alternative - at
least for serious networking tasks (not just serving web pages fished up of
the nearest database). I have high hopes.

Anyway, thanks again.

Terry
