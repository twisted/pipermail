</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. it makes it easy to specify a system (both manually and based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the module your code is in)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;ve held back from this discussion so far because it seemed to me that I always missed some part of the discussion to fully understand what you&#8217;re all talking about. I would like to comment on this concrete proposal though before I hold my peace forever. (NB I&#8217;m not replying just to Christopher but try to address everything I saw on the thread so far &#8211; I like most of his proposal.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I find that there&#8217;s some kind of false dichotomy brought up in this discussion and API and output are somewhat muddled together a bit (maybe I&#8217;m just misunderstanding though &#8211; that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t comment until now).
</I>
You're right. I didn't make a strong enough point about the fact that
the output formatting isn't important, but I assumed everyone already
knew that. I should have been more clear.


&gt;<i> I personally like my logs 100% structured (except for Exceptions) and still be able to &#8220;comment&#8221; on events in plain English if I need to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I don&#8217;t see why comments/events should be special case on output (square brackets in this example). If you have an event called user_error, you can always add a key called error for another &#8220;symbol&#8221; or just an error_msg if you insist on English. When looking for a certain type of user_error, you simply write an AND clause in your logging software (Kibana or whatever). It&#8217;s pretty easy to keep *that* consistent across applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, *my* log would look like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> event=user_error peer=127.0.0.1 error=pebkac
</I>
The special formatting in the example I gave was only intended for the
dumb file-based format. I thought it was just a nice touch on the spur
of the moment. In practice, I would use this for local logging, but
then set up a log observer that passed raw key/value data to my real
log aggregation/storage/filtering system. I'm making a distinction
between what we show our users (in a twistd.log file) and what we give
to our automated systems (sent over network protocols to logging
systems).

&gt;<i> If the programmer in question hadn&#8217;t enough logging pain in their life to see that&#8217;s reasonable, they can always do:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> event=user_error peer=127.0.0.1 error_msg='Problem exists between keyboard and chair.'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still perfectly parseable, perfectly readable. And with {!r} easy to achieve. A nice API I would like to have be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> log('user_error', peer=self.transport.getPeer().host, error_msg='Problem exists between keyboard and chair.') &#8211; and log figures out itself if it needs to quote. I could also live with them all quoted, i.e.:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> event='user_error' peer='127.0.0.1' error='pebkac'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> to have less special cases.
</I>
It sounds like you're arguing that the human-readable *.log format
should be closer to the simple key/value representation that we use
underneath.

Would you also argue that instead of having a log line that looks like:

2013-06-15 10:24:21-0500 [-] Server Shut Down.

We should actually format them (in twistd.log) like this?

time=1371331461.0 system='-' msg='Server Shut Down.'

&gt;<i> I hope that makes some sense, the point I&#8217;m trying to make that events don&#8217;t need to be distinct by themselves. If you enforce that, you&#8217;re forcing structure on them which you could spread over multiple fields that are *much* more pleasant to parse.
</I>
So, if I had my own way, &quot;event&quot; would be a required argument to the
log() function in my example, so that the only thing I'm forcing on
the structure of a log message is that you *have* an event argument.

But I'm pretty sure that's not going to fly. :-) So the only reason I
wanted to support &quot;event&quot; in a special way in my example is to
emphasize and encourage its use.
