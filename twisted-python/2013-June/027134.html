I think technically that would solve the problem.  It sounds like a bit 
of a nightmare though.  But that's what we get for using types to 
indicate error conditions, I suppose?

Cancellation is still new, and I don't think many people are using it 
yet (how could they, since no one has bothered to write any 
documentation for it).  I suspect different people probably also have 
different ideas about how it *should* be used - and so we've probably 
all started to go off in somewhat different directions, which is going 
to result in disagreement in what practices are best.

I think the best possible next step here is to actually document what 
it's already possible to do with cancellation (I think there are several 
non-obvious tricks - mainly in the area of asynchronous cancellation, a 
feature not *explicitly* supported by the API, but still possible). 
After that, perhaps we'll be able to see what it's *not* possible to do 
and then a discussion about how to fill in the gaps in functionality 
will be a lot easier to have.
