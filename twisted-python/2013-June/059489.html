This is actually called a &quot;squash&quot; in Git terminology - Git has an
option called &quot;--squash&quot; for the &quot;merge&quot; command which precisely do
that. This is, FYI, part of the merge policy used by projects like
PostgreSQL for example [1]

I'm not sure we can exactly say it changes the history: a brand new
commit is actually created, which is the sum of all the commits from the
branch which is merged, but as I see it, it's as if someone else
commited this new feature, and branches become completely throwable in
the end.

I let the Git manual explain the squash feature (extract from &quot;git help
merge&quot;; the second sentence is probably the most useful):

    --squash, --no-squash
        Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge
        happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually
        make a commit or move the HEAD, nor record $GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD
        to cause the next git commit command to create a merge commit.
        This allows you to create a single commit on top of the current
        branch whose effect is the same as merging another branch (or
        more in case of an octopus).

        With --no-squash perform the merge and commit the result.  This
        option can be used to override --squash.
