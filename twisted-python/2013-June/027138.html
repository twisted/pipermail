These are all pretty good points.

In fact, I think I'm going to withdraw my suggestion.  Having better ways to classify errors would be useful in some circumstances, but it's demonstrably not *necessary*, and a system to arbitrarily classify every single cancellation that any Deferred might raise (not to mention documentation of how to make use of all this information).

So I will save any further words I might write in this thread for narrative documentation for cancellation :).
