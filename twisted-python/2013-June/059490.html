Would you be interested in contributing to those resources by doing some reviews yourself? :)

As a non-committer, you can do reviews of fixes contributed by committers (like me, exarkun, dreid, radix, therve...).  It's up to the committer to decide whether your review was thorough enough, so it's their fault if you didn't do a good enough job :).  If you clear those tickets out of the queue, it gives committers more time to review tickets from external contributors.

&gt;<i> This is not a complain :), but what I wanted to say is that maybe it

</I>&gt;<i> the code to independent projects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this way, core developers will have more time to review more

</I>&gt;<i> and later maintaining that code.
</I>
There are, possibly, some features that Twisted could shed.  But, based on my experience, I don't think that this is a major issue.  A big reason that we need code review is to introduce external contributors to our coding practices so that they can work up to making more significant changes; in that sense, most reviews are similar unless they're really big.

Also, one of the main advantages of Twisted is that it's a feature-rich suite of protocols which work together.  It's nice to have common documentation and testing standards applied to all of them.  (One day, after they've been maintained for another 10 years or so, maybe that'll even mean they all have good documentation and tests! :-)).
