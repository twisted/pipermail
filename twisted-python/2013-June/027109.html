Would you agree that it would be preferable? (Again, not taking compatibility into account -- I'm trying to get compatibility vs niceness of API to face off against each other. Personally, I think it's enough of a change in functionality to warrant a chance in ways a function can fail, but there's no point in even having that argument if there's no consensus that the composed way would even be better...)

I agree that it would be preferable, but I don't see how it's possible without making Exception itself composeable.

&gt;<i>  After all, if it's interesting that the operation was cancelled, presumably it's interesting at what stage the operation is cancelled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IIUC that would work the same with composition as inheritance :)
</I>
Unfortunately inheritance is built into the way Python handles exceptions.  In fact in this case you almost want *multiple* inheritance, so you can say 'except CancelledError:' or 'except ConnectionError:' as appropriate.  :-(

The one saving grace here is that not a whole lot of useful logic can live on the exception objects, so there's a limited amount of opportunity for getting oneself into trouble.

Please prove me wrong, though.
