<PRE>Hi Tom

&gt;<i> Since most apis in twisted don't pass a canceller, the behavior is a2+a3.
</I>
Right. That was the intention (glyph's). It was expected that over time
more Twisted apis that create deferreds would add cancellers. As I
understand it, Kai Zhang is now adding cancellers to some apis returning
deferreds, starting with the POP3 client.

Based on JP's comment, I still think I'm missing something here.

The only suggestion I've been making is that, if we wanted to, we could
allow a value to be passed to the cancel call. That would allow errback
functions to receive more information when a Deferred is canceled. You'd
still get a CancelledError in any case, but the value would be in the
exception instance as args[0], as in

In [1]: from twisted.internet.defer import CancelledError
In [2]: e = CancelledError('hey')
In [3]: e.args[0]
Out[3]: 'hey'
