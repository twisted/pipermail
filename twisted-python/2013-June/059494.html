It shouldn't ever happen in an Open Source project, or on &quot;master&quot; but in a corporate setting... you'd be surprised. 

	a - Someone accidentally commits and pushes a config file with credentials in it
	b - You have commits A,B,C,D,E.  D needs to be rebased out in order for a merge to successfully work.  You can't get rebase to work well, so you have to roll back to C, push -f, apply a diff from C-E ( which doesn't have D in it, all done by hand ), and then committed.  

Thankfully when someone brings this to you , you can say to your team &quot;Ok.  everyone nuke your git repos and go to lunch.  i'll fix it for you&quot;.

That being said, i'm a HUGE fan of having an &quot;upstream&quot; repo that is only used for merging in changes, and everyone has their own fork to work on.   I'm not a fan of people working in branches on the 'source' at all.
