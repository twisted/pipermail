An idea very much like this was discussed when Deferred cancellation was 
being implemented.  My recollection is that it was ultimately explicitly 
rejected, though I don't remember why nor do I find discussion of it on 
the ticket (#990) (lack of this information somewhere seems like a 
failure of the development process).  I admit the idea of being able to 
get additional information passed through the system seems appealing to 
me, but *not* having any additional information does simplify the 
interface.  Considering how much trouble people already have with 
Deferreds without even bringing cancellation into play, maybe the 
simpler interface is a good thing.

My earlier point was that any Deferred for which cancellation is not 
already explicitly implemented already has a cancellation behavior: it 
will fire its errback chain with `CancelledError`.  It is an 
incompatible change to replace this with a different exception type - 
such as `ConnectionDone`.

This is slightly different than your suggestion, Terry, I think - in 
that you propose sticking more information onto the `CancelledError`, 
not changing the type of the `Failure` that is sent down the errback 
chain.  However, the thread was started specifically with the question 
of whether changing `CancelledError` to `ConnectionDone` is acceptable 
and that's the point I was mainly focused on.
