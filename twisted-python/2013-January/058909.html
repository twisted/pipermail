</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Those are both good points! I'll leave it this way until there's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; a more official way of doing it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I hope it's clear that just hard-coding your avatars and realms to work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; only with each other is a sub-optimal solution :).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Indeed :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The architecture of cred is supposed to be that you can plug realms and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; checkers together so that a change to your authentication backend doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; completely change your application.  Of course, that architecture is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; flawed in the sense that a string is a bit too narrow of a communication
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; channel to get information about the authenticated user from one to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; other, especially in cases where the application needs information from a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; directory service to function.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If you're interested in an improved, official way to deal with this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; use-case, the best way to do that would be to get involved and actively
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; try to specify what you need.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here's my use case. The CredentialsChecker takes a login name,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; e.g. &quot;pwest&quot;, and looks it up in LDAP. It gets back an LDAP record
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   'distinguishedName': 'CN=Peter Westlake,OU=User
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Accounts,OU=EMEA,DC=example,DC=com',
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   'cn': 'Peter Westlake',
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   'name': 'Peter Westlake',
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   'sn': 'Westlake',
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   'mail': '<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">Peter.Westlake at example.com</A>',
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   'givenName': 'Peter',
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   'sAMAccountName': 'pwest'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; }
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It passes the distinguishedName and the supplied password
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the LDAP password checker function for authorization.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At this point the correct thing to do would be to return &quot;pwest&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as the avatarId. But I've got all that other useful information
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available, and it seems a shame to have to get it again in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Realm, so I return the whole dictionary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One potentially interesting question here, as well, is &quot;why
</I>&gt;<i> sAMAccountName&quot; as the avatarID?  Isn't there a UID or UUID in there
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere?  In my application, all the user identifiers are opaque, and
</I>&gt;<i> that makes a bit more sense, since those values don't change, although
</I>&gt;<i> any other part of the user's record could change as information evolves
</I>&gt;<i> over time.  For example, if someone gets married and changes their name,
</I>&gt;<i> they might find it annoying to have to log in with a username that
</I>&gt;<i> references their maiden name all the time.
</I>
That would be a good design, yes, and I'll bear it in mind for future
use.
But for now I'm stuck with a system that has no way to change usernames,
as I discovered the hard way when my original employer was acquired. To
this day I have different logins for Unix and the rest of the corporate
infrastructure. (In case someone asks: the Unix name would be easy
enough to change, but it's used in a lot of places. One day, maybe.)
The account name is the closest thing to a unique id that's available.

&gt;<i> &gt; Some points to note:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Converting the dict to a string would make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   the avatarId conform to the interface, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   it still wouldn't be pluggable, because other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   checkers wouldn't return the extra information.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   This strikes me as a general problem. If the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   checker returns more than an avatarId, whether
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   directly or through some official-sanctioned channel,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   it will only be interchangeable with other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   checkers that also return the extra information.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. The application knows about LDAP, and uses it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   to find things like your manager and your email
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   address. Some of this information is in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   avatarId, but some of it isn't, so some LDAP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   calls will have to be made. This weakens the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   argument against duplicating the lookup.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The correct thing to do in this case would undoubtedly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be to accept that an LDAP call isn't very expensive,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and repeat it in the Realm. In other words, my use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; case isn't very compelling. You have shamed me into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changing it :-)   In one way this is a good result,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though it doesn't help with the design.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Having made that change, I can use a password file
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or an in-memory database for testing, and write
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; test scripts that don't need a real password. That's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well worth the /completely unnoticeable/ expense
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of an extra LDAP call!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As other posters have already said, you can also have your realm and your
</I>&gt;<i> checker share a reference to an object that caches credentials.  This
</I>&gt;<i> would also let you cache other calls that are made later, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; BUT:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This only works because it doesn't use the user's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; password for binding to LDAP. If it did, then either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the password or the LDAP session would have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be made available to the Realm, and we're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; back at square 1.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems like the &quot;shared caching reference&quot; would solve this problem
</I>&gt;<i> as well?
</I>
Yes, I think that's the right answer. It's certainly the right design
in my case, and perhaps in the general case too.

Thanks for looking into this,

Peter.
