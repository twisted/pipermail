Thanks, I appreciate that :).

&gt;<i> But let me say that I usually take a look at NEWS.txt before upgrading in 
</I>&gt;<i> order to understand if the changes can impact my code and act properly in 
</I>&gt;<i> such case. I think this case is quite different because I see no attempts to

</I>&gt;<i> requirement is not mentioned at all in NEWS.txt. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just thinking that maybe being a little more backward-compatible and/or 
</I>&gt;<i> verbose in ChangeLog when introducing potentially disrupting changes
</I>&gt;<i> could greatly help in identifying issues like this one.
</I>
The problem is not that we knew it was going to break things and we didn't care - it's that we didn't notice that the backwards compatibility problem had crept in, and we mistakenly believed that existing users would be using byte strings, or that existing users using unicode strings would already have been broken.  Or we simply forgot.

The reason we need you to test your programs is so that we notice that there is a mistake that needs fixing.  If we already knew about the compatibility problem, we would not have written release notes about it, we would have fixed it before the release :).
