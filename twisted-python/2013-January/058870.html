</I>I agree with Jean-Paul. Writing documentation in ignorance (no offense
intended to any party) is not a good way to write good documentation. I
think we've seen a number of attempts at this that have resulted in pretty
shoddy documentation. I do think, however, that *right after you learn*
something you are in a good position to benefit the documentation of the
project.

The argument has also been made (not in this thread; I mean in general)
that the process of learning something allows one to structure
documentation about it in a way that applies well to another person
learning something, but I think that concept has flaws as well. I think
that a common result of such attempts is that someone will hit a common
blocker in understanding their subject and then go off on a number of
misguided tangents, and then when they finally come to understand the
subject their sudden insight becomes associated in their mind with the
resolution of the misguided attempts.

But that's all just conjecture and isn't really core to my point.

I think despite all these problems with writing as one learns, it's
valuable to make an attempt at writing some documentation as one learns
something, as long as there is a sincere modesty on one's part and a
willingness to let their documentation be seriously overhauled or at least
critiqued by the real experts on the subject (assuming those experts can
muster the time to do the critiquing or overhauling).
