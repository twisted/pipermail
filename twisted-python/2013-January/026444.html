That was the main reason I didn't actually implement a cache :-)
Plus I have a nice solution that works, and only costs one LDAP call.

Thank you!

The main question left in my mind is about the degree of dependency
between the checker and the realm if extra information is passed,
by whatever method. If the realm expects the checker to pass it
(for instance) an LDAP session, then it's pretty much committed
to one particular checker. That means abandoning pluggability -
which admittedly isn't very sensible in that case - and once you
do that, simply passing back a complex structure as an avatarId
seems as good a method as any. It's simple, and it works now.
Likewise Itamar's special-purpose portal suggestion.

Peter.
