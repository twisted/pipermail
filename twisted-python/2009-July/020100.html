In my experience, this what happens to every project that a) uses a wiki for
core documentation and b) has more than one person editing the wiki.

</I>&gt;<i> As you say, I think that the wiki could be useful as a staging ground to

</I>&gt;<i> users, since what they will probably find are many unfinished ideas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, a separate doc repo with sphinx based doc could be built
</I>&gt;<i> so that it will allow for collaborative development making clear that is
</I>&gt;<i> a work in progress and a product with 'releases'. I say a different repo
</I>&gt;<i> to avoid having to give commit access to code for people who are working
</I>&gt;<i> on doc,  maybe same repo with different permissions would be better. And
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest sphinx to a) start from scratch and add existing doc as we see
</I>&gt;<i> it's relevant, b) have a more flexible base than HTML docs, and for the
</I>&gt;<i> reasons mentioned by Kevin (plus I want to learn it :P).

</I>I'd love to see a documentation &quot;reboot&quot; using Sphinx, but not if it's going
to be a half-baked, never-finished project.

Since Jessica started this thread, and is the only person (so far) who has
given any sort of commitment to actually working on new/revised docs, I'd
really like to hear her opinion.

Jessica?  You still out there?  Hope we haven't scared you off...

I'd also be interested in hearing the opinions of some of the core Twisted
guys on the various things we've been talking about here.  What do you guys
think about using a different docs system than what is being used now?  If
you guys are all dead set against it, there's not much point hashing out the
details...

Also, what do the Twisted core devs think about having a secondary
wiki/cookbook thingy outside of the core docs?
