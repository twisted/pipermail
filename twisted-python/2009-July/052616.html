Well, pragmatism is my basic reason for not liking wikis for docs. :)

For me, it boils down to every time I've worked on or with a project that
used wikis for docs (assuming that the project is of at least moderate size
and has more than a couple of editors) that documentation has been
terrible.  It's ended up as a disjointed mess, that's hard to navigate, and
has a bajillion half-completed thoughts, and lots of outdated cruft.

Of course, some could say the same of (at least parts of) the current
Twisted documentation. ;)

It's not that there's anything wrong with wiki's per se, it's just that they
encourage &quot;bad habits&quot;.  If there were a solid editorial process in place,
where someone was specifically responsible for reviewing, editing,
splitting, merging, and correcting documents, then a wiki could probably
work.  But I think it's easier to get coherent docs using tools that
encourage &quot;good habits&quot;.

Obviously my definitions of &quot;good habits&quot; and &quot;bad habits&quot; are pretty
vague...and not entirely spelled out even in my own mind.  Er, sorry about
that...
