Yep, that's the idea.

&gt;<i> A minor nit here, would you put the interfaces in their own module,

</I>
Done in new revision.

&gt;<i> There are multiple layers here.  Let's have an object for each layer.  The
</I>&gt;<i> NMEA protocol parser object should send NMEA-sentence events to a sentence
</I>&gt;<i> receiver object, then there should be an implementation of the
</I>&gt;<i> sentence-receiver interface which generates positioning events and sends
</I>&gt;<i> them on to a positioning-receiver interface.
</I>
Agreed. That's what I'm doing now -- see nmea.NMEASentence. This will
perpetuate through the rest of the code.

&gt;<i> I've attached a sketch, but it elides certain details like set-up and
</I>&gt;<i> tear-down; there should be methods which allow users to tell when sentences
</I>&gt;<i> and positions start and stop arriving.  The gist would be to have a
</I>&gt;<i> connectionMade and connectionLost invoke startReceivingNMEA,
</I>&gt;<i> stopReceivingNMEA, which in turn would invoke startReceivingPositions, and
</I>&gt;<i> stopReceivingPositions.
</I>
Extremely helpful, thank you. I think I was confused because
LineReceivers, which make sense for NMEA since it's a line based text
protocol delimited by '\r\n', is-a protocol but is called &quot;receiver&quot;,
so I figured my receiver should be a LineReceiver, and not that it
should be delegated from by a LineReceiver subclass. To be honest, it
still looks kind of wonky that a LineReceiver (well, a subclass)
delegates to a receiver, but maybe that's just my inexperience showing
:<i>-)
</I>
What exactly would those
startReceivingNMEA/stopReceivingNMEA/startReceivingPositions/stopReceivingPositions
do? I don't think there's any setup to be done, so I guess that I
should just have an instance attribute on the appropriate class that
is set by startFoo/stopFoo. If it's false, callbacks don't fire.
Right?

&gt;<i> There should also be a factory which nicely hooks everything together and
</I>&gt;<i> takes only a factory for your IPositioningProvider, so that users can
</I>&gt;<i> quickly get started with a positioning provider.
</I>
Okay, I'll do that as soon as people have reviewed the changes
suggested in your last mail, so that I know I got it right :-)

(also, sorry for the late reply -- the mailing list decided to make me
wait three hours before I could see my own mail, let alone yours)

Thanks for your input
Laurens
