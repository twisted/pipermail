<PRE>Geez .... what a HUGE duh moment. This will ultimately run on multiple
remote servers, but, while doing initial testing, I have been running it on
just my dev box. And, of course, I keep forgetting that twisted (well,
python) doesn't make use of multiple cores. I wasted all yesterday trying to
figure out why this was running the way it was.....
A million thanks.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let me start off by warning everyone that I am extremely new to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things don't work the way I think they should. Or, I'm just using them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; incorrectly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [..]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problems:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right now, for development and testing, I have three servers running
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on localhost on three ports.
</I>&gt;<i> Are you running them in a single process?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When I run my test code, it seems that each Perspective Broker runs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sequentially, rather than concurrently. For example, if i watch the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debugging output from the server, I see the following:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server 0 processing dataval1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server 0 processing dataval2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server 0 processing dataval3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server 0 processing dataval4
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server 1 processing dataval*5*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server 1 processing dataval6
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server 1 processing dataval7
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server 2 processing dataval8
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server 2 processing dataval9
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server 2 processing dataval10
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My understanding is that the perspective brokers would work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concurrently. Is that incorrect? My guess is that they should work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concurrently and I am just doing something wrong in my code, due to my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very, very limited understanding of how they work. Well, how much of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; twisted works, really.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Below is my the relevant code for the client (I've taken out code that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just deals with prepping data or debugging). Please keep in mind that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this is mostly testing code, while I get a better understanding of how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perspective brokers work and was cobbled together from examples and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; docs found online.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the client code, nothing seems wrong, since it doesn't enforce one
</I>&gt;<i> job to be finished before starting the next one - the problem has to be
</I>&gt;<i> on the server side. Actually I suspect you're running the same service
</I>&gt;<i> on 3 ports but within one process, right?. If this is the case it's no
</I>&gt;<i> wonder the order of jobs completed matches exactly the order they're
</I>&gt;<i> arriving in  because it all happens in a single thread. If you want
</I>&gt;<i> parallel processing you will have to use multiple processes. As a side
</I>&gt;<i> note (which doesn't seem to apply here): if the work they're doing is
</I>&gt;<i> not CPU-bound, but IO-bound (meaning the work is nothing but waiting for
</I>&gt;<i> something to complete, which for some reason can't be done in an
</I>&gt;<i> asynchronous manner, the most prominent examples being blocking database
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces), you also have the alternative of using threads.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the basic problem is you're assuming twisted to somehow schedule
</I>&gt;<i> the work to different cores/cpus, which it doesn't do by default. You
</I>&gt;<i> might want to look at ampoule <A HREF="https://launchpad.net/ampoule,">https://launchpad.net/ampoule,</A> which is a
</I>&gt;<i> process pool, there was another similar thing called AsynQueue, but the
</I>&gt;<i> site is down atm: <A HREF="http://foss.eepatents.com/AsynQueue.">http://foss.eepatents.com/AsynQueue.</A>
