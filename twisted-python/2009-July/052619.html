That is one of my pet peeves about project documents of any type.    
Tutorials, and examples especially.  There's nothing more frustrating  
than getting 1/2 way through a tutorial, only to realize that the rest  
of it is just not going to work with the current version and that all  
that effort was wasted because that's not how it's done any more.

If it's not dated, and perhaps tagged with the first version with  
which it was released, and the most recent version at which it was  
modified, it's impossible to figure out what's current, relevent, and  
likely to actually work with the current release.
