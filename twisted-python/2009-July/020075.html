</I>&gt;<i> At some point I realized that it helps to realize that code that looks
</I>&gt;<i> synchronous really isn't at all. Probably all the programming that almost
</I>&gt;<i> all of us will ever do is not synchronous. You type
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  x = y + 3
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and you get into the habit of thinking that x just got assigned the value
</I>&gt;<i> of y + 3. But there's a whole set of levels of operations, all invisible to
</I>&gt;<i> you, that are frantically rearranging atoms behind the scenes to pull off
</I>&gt;<i> this tiny miracle. Instead of trying to wrap your head around the so-called
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;weird&quot; asynchronous operation of Twisted, it's easier to let fall the
</I>&gt;<i> comforting illusion that you're in the synchronous world to begin with -
</I>&gt;<i> whatever that's supposed to mean (it's more like a fairy tale IMO). You're
</I>&gt;<i> not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's more accurate to think that that line of code arranges for x to
</I>&gt;<i> *eventually* hold the value of y + 3. Then it's a small step to thinking
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  x = y + 3
</I>&gt;<i>  z = f(x)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> is just another slightly bigger part of the same illusion. Those lines of
</I>&gt;<i> code aren't executed one after another at all. You're just brought up with
</I>&gt;<i> the fairy tale that they are - or at least you study computer science and
</I>&gt;<i> spend so much time with high-level languages that you start to take it for
</I>&gt;<i> granted that they are done one after the other. But the second line is
</I>&gt;<i> *eventually* executed after the first, assuming nothing went wrong (e.g., y
</I>&gt;<i> could be None).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At that point - everything is asynchronous - you have the right mindset to
</I>&gt;<i> think perfectly clearly about Twisted code. And there's no jump to make at
</I>&gt;<i> all. The only things you have to get your head around are 1) the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted code doesn't give you the comforting linear illusion of so-called
</I>&gt;<i> synchronous code as you type it in your editor (inlineCallbacks helps a lot
</I>&gt;<i> with improving that), and 2) that Twisted's deferreds are the way of
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining the flow of results (both correct and incorrect) through time
</I>&gt;<i> as your program executes. I.e., you've lost the step-at-a-time line-by-line
</I>&gt;<i> results computed on line N are available on line N+1 flow of code you can
</I>&gt;<i> so easily read in your editor, and in exchange you have deferreds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could go on, obviously :-) But I just wanted to point out that the shift
</I>&gt;<i> from thinking &quot;synchronously&quot; to &quot;asynchronously&quot; is much easier to make if
</I>&gt;<i> you realize the former is a convenient illusion and in fact you've always
</I>&gt;<i> been doing things asynchronously.

Thanks for this, Terry.  I'd never thought of it that way, and it's quite a
good point.
