</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Perhaps it works that way. And what makes things worse is that if datagram

</I>&gt;<i>LoopingCall calls will never be invoked.
</I>
It will eventually stop reading datagrams and go do something else.  The
exact way it decides when to stop is completely arbitrary and I don't
think anyone has ever demonstrated that it's clever or appropriate in the
general case (it stops after reading 256k of datagrams).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As JP has said, you're not allowed to block the main loop like that, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've seen similar problems with even relatively quick datagramReceived
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handlers (~0.1msec) under very high load (1000pps) resulting in a form
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of starvation. This isn't generally a problem with TCP calls due to flow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> control.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I do not think I'm blocking the main loop so much. I'd say I create a
</I>&gt;<i>condition when data processing time is a little bit longer than the period
</I>&gt;<i>of incoming datagrams arrival.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>By way of feedback, it looks to me that if reactor API would give
</I>&gt;<i>user some degree of control on timed versus receiption calls sequencing,
</I>&gt;<i>that would become a more-or-less elegant solution for issues like mine.
</I>
One possibility is that we could document the limit I described above and
tell people to adjust it upwards or downwards as they so desire.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The solution is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  def datagramReceived(...):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    reactor.callLater(0, dorealwork, ...)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  def dorealwork(self, ...):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This will schedule the &quot;real&quot; work as soon as possible in the next
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reactor loop, but also &quot;fairly&quot; in line with other calls.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks for the hint!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>With this callLater approach, timer function works better, though, still
</I>&gt;<i>not absolutely fair:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As we can see, timer call period seems to grow over high load.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
reactor.callLater(0, f) isn't magic.  I probably wouldn't have suggested
it as a solution here.  All it means (more or less) is &quot;do this work after
all current i/o events have been dispatched.&quot;  You still might end up with
more than one second of processing bunched up together, and so you'll still
miss a LoopingCall iteration.
