I'm not invested in websockets at this point.  I'm not using them for 
anything and I don't anticipate using them for anything in the 
foreseeable future.

That said, as a lot of people seem to be excited about them, I hope 
Twisted will eventually have nice support for them.

It seems like the pace of revision of the specification demands 
something different from Twisted's normal development/release cycle 
though.  How would people feel about taking the code from #4173 and 
developing it outside of Twisted until the specification is finalized, 
then moving it back in?  As far as I know, it should be equally easy to 
implement as an external feature for Twisted Web as it is to do as an 
integral part.  And since there are so many people interested in this, 
moving the source into a VCS with a better distributed workflow and 
better merging features seems to make sense.
