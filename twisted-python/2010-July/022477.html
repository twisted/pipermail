<PRE>Hello,

I'm currently busy with implementing SMPP in Twisted, and there is
something I would like to have a piece of advice with.

If I'm going to make it internal to my needs, there's only issue of
making it work and be done with it. But that's not quite a way I would
like to do it; I would like to end up with an implementation which
would be reusable and beneficial for the community as well, so that
anyone would be then able to take this implementation and get his or
her service an almost instant ability to talk SMPP (news via SMS?
microblogging via SMS? ...)

Thus keeping in mind that SMPP by its nature is not entirely unlike
your old instant messaging and mailing protocols, albeit geared
towards mobile content, there might be some interfaces already in
Twisted which I would need to implement before it becomes interesting
to anyone else.

Can anyone give me some useful pointers on that?

P. S. I have seen some SMPP-related discussions popping up on this
list, but it seems that to date, nothing open source and under active
development and maintenance has been produced so far.
