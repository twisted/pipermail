<PRE>Hi David,

&gt;<i> That's not to say using multiple A records isn't a helpful practice
</I>&gt;<i> for many sorts of outages (especially to permit controlled
</I>&gt;<i> maintenance).  Just don't expect it to necessarily be sufficient in
</I>&gt;<i> all failure modes depending on the behavior you want clients to
</I>&gt;<i> experience.
</I>
Indeed, in our application it's considered an optimisation over DNS
failover. This is why we also use a low TTL (30 seconds) to purge the
bad A records out of the pool as soon as possible.

&gt;<i> If this is strictly limited to a client you control, it's much less of
</I>&gt;<i> an issue, since you can drop the TCP connect timeout much lower than
</I>&gt;<i> what it defaults to, though you still probably can't match how fast it
</I>&gt;<i> can happen for rejected connections, since you'll want to leave enough
</I>&gt;<i> room for occasional latency or response time issues without
</I>&gt;<i> immediately failing over.  But you can do a lot better than the system
</I>&gt;<i> defaults.
</I>
Unfortunately we have no control over the clients' configuration (this
is a LAMP web hosting environment). But 30 seconds is considered much
more acceptable than the days it can often take a manual repair job if a
server goes down.
