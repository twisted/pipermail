That would indeed be cool :).

There are some existing interfaces in twisted.words.im, which you can see here:

	&lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk/twisted/words/im/interfaces.py">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk/twisted/words/im/interfaces.py</A>&gt;

but they have not seen a lot of maintenance, and they date back to a much less awesome time in Twisted's history.  Still, there may be some small utility in implementing them, if for no other reason than to encourage them to become better documented and supported!

I don't have much advice as to *what* to implement, how to structure your code and such, but I do have some advice as to *how* you should go about it:

	1. put it up on Launchpad.  don't wait until your design is done; develop it in the open to solicit feedback.
	2. choose a nice, obvious name (might I suggest 'txsmpp'?)
	3. use test-driven development, so that your code is maintainable!
	4. join the 'tx' meta-project &lt;<A HREF="https://launchpad.net/tx">https://launchpad.net/tx</A>&gt;
	5. when you are, of course, totally successful, write a success story and send it to &lt;mailto:<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">success at twistedmatrix.com</A>&gt;.

Hope that helps,
