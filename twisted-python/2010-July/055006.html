It's certainly the smoothest I've done.

I can't stress how amazingly helpful it is to have a detailed process
doc, and how important it is to see any glitches in the release as
bugs in the document.

&gt;&gt;<i> Note that the Ubuntu feature freeze is August 12th, so we can expect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 10.1 to be the release that goes into Ubuntu 10.10.

</I>&gt;<i> I would *like* to accelerate the schedule for this release if we can get
</I>&gt;<i> certain important features in which missed the last release (documentation
</I>&gt;<i> for endpoints, documentation for cancellation, endpoint string parsing,
</I>&gt;<i> endpoint plugins, and some SSL issues that Jean-Paul and I discovered while
</I>&gt;<i> working on these).  It would be nice to establish the precedent that
</I>&gt;<i> important features cause releases to happen *faster*, rather than causing
</I>&gt;<i> them to be delayed.
</I>
I would like the same.

I was going to say that maybe those things are worth doing a 10.1.1
release for, but then I thought better. Let's keep point releases for
critical defects.

&gt;<i> But I certainly don't want to make any promises about getting it done by a
</I>&gt;<i> particular advance date.  I thought that you handled the delays and setbacks
</I>&gt;<i> in this release fairly well - I can't see myself doing it substantially
</I>&gt;<i> better - and so trying to accelerate the schedule may just result in the
</I>&gt;<i> release actually occurring on time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Making promises about time is difficult for unpaid volunteers. :)

&gt;&gt;<i> As part of this release, there have been many improvements to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> release process document, see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReleaseProcess.">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReleaseProcess.</A> I would greatly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appreciate it if the document could be reviewed for clarity and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> correctness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will obviously be doing this in more detail as I move forward with the
</I>&gt;<i> next release, but the recent edits are a big improvement to the clarity and
</I>&gt;<i> completeness of the document.
</I>
Thanks.

It's basically only possible to test the document by doing a release.
My brain turns to cheese whenever I try to review it while not
actually doing something.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The biggest blockers to a swift release, from my perspective, were the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> following:
</I>...
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * delaying to wait for feedback on the release candidate
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems to me like a necessary delay.  I wish that we could motivate the
</I>&gt;<i> readers of this mailing list to be a bit more responsive, but I don't see
</I>&gt;<i> how we could have been much louder about it :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think I should have announced the closing date for testing (as in,
if it's not in by June Xth, we aren't going to do know about it).

&gt;<i>  * waiting for the review for the release ticket
</I>&gt;<i>  * waiting for someone else to solve the buildbot issues for Windows
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It looks like those issues were a one-time thing, at least.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The delay on waiting for the ticket to be reviewed happened last time also.

I don't really have any ideas as to what to do about it, but I'd like
to avoid the experience of sitting around for hours killing time at my
computer on a weekend waiting for a review that may never come.
