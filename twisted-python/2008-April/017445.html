</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if a new connection is received, a protocol instance is made and its

</I>&gt;<i> to the next thing.  That might be another connectionMade for a new connection,
</I>&gt;<i> or it might be delivering a few bytes to a protocol (via calling dataReceived on
</I>&gt;<i> it).  So there a lots of events, but the event handlers (i.e. things like
</I>&gt;<i> methods on Protocol subclasses) don't block, so they return control very
</I>&gt;<i> quickly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In threaded network code typically you frequently do &quot;sock.recv()&quot; and similar,
</I>&gt;<i> to block.  In Twisted you just omit that; your protocol's dataReceived will be
</I>&gt;<i> called whenever there's some data.  This frees up the main thread to be doing
</I>&gt;<i> other work when there's nothing happening on an individual connection.  So
</I>&gt;<i> that's how multiple connections can be handled concurrently in a single thread
</I>&gt;<i> in Twisted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only rule is that you cannot block in the main thread.  If you want to do
</I>&gt;<i> something blocking, find a different way to do it (or if you have to, do it in a
</I>&gt;<i> thread and let the main thread continue, but at least for network I/O that's
</I>&gt;<i> never necessary in Twisted).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does that help?

</I>Yes Andrew, thanks! So keeps a list of all connections around and does 
something with them when there is something to be done. So if I have a 
shared list, only one connection actually access it at a time, thus 
mutexes don't need to be used, but if something needs to be atomic, like 
one message depending on the answer of another, I would use deferred 
objects, If I need to to some heavy I/O (other than network) or lengthy 
processing I would use a thread that returns a deferred, correct? So 
like in code that calls an external program and I need to do something 
when it is done, I would use twisted.internet.utils.getProcessValue(), 
get a deferred and add a callback to do whatever I need to do when it is 
done. Ok, I get it better now :-)

Thanks for all your help (Andrew and others)!!
Gabriel
