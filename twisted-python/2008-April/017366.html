The most important overall message would seem to be:  use web[1], since
even if web2 is not phased out, as much as possible of web2 is being
&quot;back-ported&quot; to web[1], and there will probably be a relatively easy
migration path to web2 if/when it is completed at some point in the
future.

No?
