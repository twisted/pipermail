</I>&gt;<i> misleading rather than helping.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Trying to write a rpy. Of course, it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> work. Looking at all those different docs, I'm bewildered. Somehow hacking my way through it.
</I>&gt;<i> They talk about &quot;resource trees&quot;, yet I don't find them in the doc. I
</I>&gt;<i> find putchild() but all examples and docs indicate, that you can do it
</I>&gt;<i> only within the root resource.
</I>&gt;<i> Again browsing, again looking desperately for some docs, that don't
</I>&gt;<i> mislead and make things even more fuzzy. Falling over an article with
</I>&gt;<i> some halfway useful tap doc.
</I>&gt;<i> OK, a little later, I
</I>&gt;<i> have my first web server running an my first rpy works, spitting out &quot;test&quot;. Wow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm wondering, why of all things &quot;rpy&quot; ? python won't generate sth.
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;rpyc&quot; for that, which translates in lost speed, I assume. No
</I>&gt;<i> explanation. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm on FreeBSD. Of course, I want to use kqueue. Now, another &quot;funny&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> journey begins ...
</I>&gt;<i> the py-kqueue in FreeBSD 6.3 and 7.0 is version 1.4. I remember,
</I>&gt;<i> however, having read something by Isthmar Trauring Shtull (forgive me,
</I>&gt;<i> if I didn't spell that correctly) that I need version 1.3 in order to
</I>&gt;<i> apply his patch, which, of course (sorry, that's my disappointment
</I>&gt;<i> carrying me away ...), doesn't work. No prob, I do it by
</I>&gt;<i> hand. To no avail. That code is old, very old and it doesn't work.
</I>&gt;<i> I remember havin seen some version 2 of pykqueue. Setup works nicely
</I>&gt;<i> but Python/twisted coughs. The module has another name now. &quot;(%&quot;%§
</I>&gt;<i> $( !!!
</I>&gt;<i> So I fall back to the version 1.4 that comes with FreeBSD ports. It
</I>&gt;<i> works. But in no-deamon mode only. As soon as I tell twistd to run
</I>&gt;<i> web.tap deamonized it vomitts and breaks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Intense googleing, and I mean &quot;intense&quot;. Reading through years of this
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list. No positive result.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I say is said, because I love python an I consider twisted
</I>&gt;<i> brilliant and immensely useful - theoretically. So, don't get me wrong
</I>&gt;<i> and accept it as constructive, albeit somewhat pissed off remarks,
</I>&gt;<i> OK :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have the clear impression that twisted is something in between a toy
</I>&gt;<i> and a brilliant product. It's hackers, however, leave much to be
</I>&gt;<i> desired in terms of usefulness. As it is, it's a great and promising
</I>&gt;<i> hobby but not a useful product.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, but doc strings don't replcae a halfway decent documentation
</I>&gt;<i> and a reasonable tutorial, considering the highly complex matter.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, but documentation that is often enough outdated and sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> offers broken links is next to useless.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, but the most brilliant code is a lot less attractive and
</I>&gt;<i> useful, if even &quot;stable versions&quot; are broken, in flux, etc ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Kqueue seems to be vital to an event driven approach like TM, yet
</I>&gt;<i> there are multiple versions of pykqueue floating
</I>&gt;<i> around, none of them properly working (and I didn't fumble around. I plain simply used the FreeBSD port), some of 
</I>&gt;<i> them with some mor and some with some less &quot;annotations&quot; (I refuse to call that doc.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - How about getting 1 version of pykqueue properly running and into
</I>&gt;<i> TM ?
</I>&gt;<i> - How about freezing some TM version (like 8.0) and updating/matching
</I>&gt;<i> docs? (Of course, experiments are funny and intriguing, but quite some
</I>&gt;<i> of us out here need sth. stable for everydays work)
</I>&gt;<i> - How about writing some complete docs and tutorials? Sth. along the
</I>&gt;<i> lines of &quot;My first web server wit TM&quot; (instead all those - sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> seeming to contradict each other - snippets)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still fascinated by TM and still willingto invest time, efforts
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> brains. But I'd love to have some properly working base and docs that expßlain rather than confuse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looking forward to learn and enjoy.

Dr. Aio,

Have you tried the finger tutorial.
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/tutorial/index.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/tutorial/index.html</A>

It's certainly well more than a snippet, and goes through getting a
finger server up and running quickly, and then refactoring it for
greater robustness.

It doesn't answer all your concerns, but it's worth spending some time
on.  

Cheers,
Cliff
