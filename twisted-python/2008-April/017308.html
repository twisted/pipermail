Perhaps I'm misinterpreting your meaning, but I think your attitude  
is way out of line.

Free software is possibly the only scenario where you truly get more  
than you pay for, but that doesn't mean it comes without a cost.

One cost is that the project and its community dictate their own  
development process, and one person has little or no ability to  
change that inertia. It is the right, possibly even the purpose of  
the community to grow however it will.

I get just as frustrated as the next guy when I need something fixed  
RFN, but that's the price you pay in exchange for a huge library of  
high-quality code. For every time I've run into an issue with Twisted  
that the core devs were too busy to fix, there's 50 other times when  
Twisted has saved my ass.

Wasteful coding? Who do you think you're talking to here?
