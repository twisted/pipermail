</I>Call me old-fashioned, but what you are describing is the difference 
between design-free-hacking
followed by iteration, and actually designing something.  You know, all 
that waterfall stuff. I know,
its not fashionable right now.

Seriously, though, its too late at the review-of-nearly-working-code. 
There's too much
pressure to incrementally fix it, and at least one participant will have 
a sense of ownership
in something that might be a country mile from the best solution.

I know its easier to design when you can meet each other and use a white 
board or
just scribble on paper, but its still entirely possible to use words.

So - I disagree.  I'm quite happy to hand-wave, and to listen to my 
colleagues'
hand-waving. If it communicates design ideas - and requirements - before 
any wasteful
coding, that's good. Honest.

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Hmm.  You sure it doesn't happen after the prioritisation meeting and we 
all get our
steer?
