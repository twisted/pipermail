<PRE>Glyph

Front-up, first thing: As far as I'm concerned, we can talk friendly.
Probably we both &quot;punished&quot; each other for things we did at least not
mean (evil). :-)

&gt;<i>    &quot;You guys really need to do X, Y, and Z to make your software usable.&quot;
</I>
Just to avoid further misunderstandings: Nope. I showed up and said
&quot;Yuck ! TM seems to be friggin great. Why do you make it
useless~unuseable~difficult and confusing to use ?&quot;

That was a decalaration of love, not war. I remember once telling my
son (then 7) sth along the line &quot;Listen, this is a very, very nice
essay and it damn deserves to be written in a way your teacher can
read it. It deserves not be written barely readable and sloppy&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt; One problem was that a lot of docs and tutorials (on the web, too) are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simply very old and also using different approaches.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Example: I'm just trying to understand how resources work. Suddenly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they talk about &quot;application&quot; and tap. That is confusing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Definitely a problem.  This is probably worth filing a ticket about, but
</I>&gt;<i> can you provide a little more detail, and some links to the relevant
</I>&gt;<i> documents and the order you discovered them in?  The more detail the easier
</I>&gt;<i> the documentation fixer's job will be.
</I>
I remember that in the section
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/</A> there are
sime links to the api (I suppose) that are broken/changed, e.g. in
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/basics.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/basics.html</A>
there is a link to &quot;twisted.application.service.Application&quot;
(<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/twisted.application.service.Application">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/twisted.application.service.Application</A>)
that's broken.

This immensily disturb when one just discovers a complex thing like TM.


&gt;<i>  We don't know exactly how newbies
</I>&gt;<i> approach the documentation because we can never approach it without knowing
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
OK, I'll try.

First I read about TM (here and there) being rudely complex. But then,
it also seemed to be the one that offered what I was looking for.
The bad reputation seemed to be mostly based in deferreds, so I looked
at those first.
Good: There is good documentation and I think anyone with some
experience in IT can understand it.
Bad: That documentation is spread all over the place, sometimes even
just a sentence or two somewhere.
Tip: Put relevant stuff in &quot;getting started&quot; and also offer links to
papers like the one about reactors.

After feeling assured enough about deferreds and actually liking them
and the was TM implements them I wanted to start up by writing a small
webserver.
What disturbed me the most was that whole resource thing and, more
generally, all that &quot;stuff&quot; like application, resource, Iresource tap,
etc.
It felt like having gotten the basic concept but having a thick fat
layer of &quot;sugar&quot;, comfort in between the core and myself. Things
didn't have a place, they didn't fit - there was no overview but it
rather felt like trial and error.
There are plenty of snippets and examples but I didn't get the overall picture.

Tip: Publish some graphics, possibly a class tree and have some
introductory essay in &quot;getting started&quot;. (e.g. Why would I want and
use &quot;application&quot; ? What does it do an how does it do that ?)

I noticed sth. similar with the API doc.
Sure, you guys know it by heart but I as a newbie can be completely
lost. Be generous and have a sentence or two with each function.

&gt;<i> ...  I do not
</I>&gt;<i> mean to suggest that you should write documentation _immediately_. Merely
</I>&gt;<i> that once you have learned enough about Twisted, you will be a good person
</I>&gt;<i> to do these improvements.
</I>
OK, sounds reasonable. Will do once I come along with TM myself.

&gt;<i> &quot;kqueue
</I>&gt;<i>  This is of course my point.  To you, perhaps.  Not to Twisted :).  But,
</I>&gt;<i> just because it's not &quot;vital&quot; doesn't mean it's not important.  We do need
</I>&gt;<i> kqueue support.  It is a selling point of Twisted to support multiple
</I>&gt;<i> different multiplexing mechanisms and kqueue is an important mechanism.
</I>
Maybe it's useful to you to consider my perspective. Actually, without
kqueue I would probably not have looked at TM. Python offers asyncore
and httpd so, somewhat more basic, of course, I would have had what I
needed if I were looking for _any_ select/poll based solution.
funny, btw. that for me personally one of the big plus-point of TM,
the whole array of protocolls, is by far less attractive. My approach
was rather &quot;Ah, cool, they offer what plain good Python doesn't have;
a solid high-performance AIO core with usefull stuff on top&quot;.
It's probaly not the audience you targetted but I'd bet there are more
like myself looking at TM.

&gt;<i>  *PLEASE* do not switch to linux to use Twisted.  We have, like, a million
</I>&gt;<i> developers who use Ubuntu.  Hence, we have very good support for linux.  We
</I>&gt;<i> need more Twisted developers who use FreeBSD (and Windows and Solaris and
</I>&gt;<i> AIX and even distros like Red Hat and SuSE).  Please, please stay around and
</I>&gt;<i> help us with that.
</I>
No worry. I wouldn't switch to Linux even if it came with naked women along * g
Seriously, I'd rather do the whole stuff in C than switch away from BSD.

&gt;<i>  The problem is that FreeBSD people often show up, complain that Twisted has
</I>&gt;<i> problems on FreeBSD, and then go away.  Either that, or they decide to give
</I>&gt;<i> up FreeBSD and just use Linux on their servers, which is great for them, but
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't help us at all.
</I>
I'll do neither. As long as I can use TM and get some help when needed
I 'll be around. On FreeBSD :)
I don't worry about the occasional hickup. I only worry about getting
into TM, about getting a good start and sth. done with it.

Again: It's just a very small thing but what I can offer right now is
a patchfile incl. the patches by ITS for the FreeBSD port. I tested it
both on 6.3 and 7.0 and it builds fine.

&gt;<i> (FreeBSD) ... so you
</I>&gt;<i> have only to worry about kqueue issues (which therve and others have already
</I>&gt;<i> done a ton of work on).
</I>
Would someone listen, please ?

Actually py-kqueue 1.4 IS WORKING on my FreeBSD.
I stressed it a little bit on my devel box, a P4, 1.8GHz, 768MB box
and it delivered nicely - around 300 connections/s with a payload of
around 2.5 KB delivered by a simple rpy. (with system load of ca.
0.75)

The problem is only, when it's daemonized. then it breaks (see my
earlier post for detailled output)


&gt;<i>  Well, let's move forward trying to make that happen.
</I>
Yes, Glyph ;)
