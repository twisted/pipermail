Thanks for the thorough diagnosis and detailed ticket!  And I'm glad to 
hear the issue is not with epoll, I'd like our users to be able to rest 
easy when upgrading to a &quot;good&quot; reactor :).  While twisted.web.proxy 
should really work well, I'm a bit less concerned to hear that it might 
have some issues.  Especially if you're planning on fixing them.

Looking at the ticket, though, it appears that web.proxy might be okay 
too, and the memory growth is just the process reaching its natural 
equilibrium, or the source is somewhere else?
&gt;<i>Unfortunately, my workaround involved rewriting my proxy code without

</I>
Not implementing IProducer/IConsumer will, ironically, lead to more 
memory consumption in the long term, since the producer will overload 
the consumer's buffer if the consumer's not fast enough.
