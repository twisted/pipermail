</I>&gt;<i> Great!  The rest definitely doesn't sound like you love it though ... ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Links are often broken, though. Often seemingly useful doc. is old, very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> old. Even current doc. isn't up to date.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since the 8.0 release, we have had quite a few problems with links, 
</I>&gt;<i> specifically the links from the core documentation to the API 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation on the website.  We are working to fix this.  However, 
</I>&gt;<i> if you spot broken links, please feel free to report them in the bug 
</I>&gt;<i> tracker: <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/newticket">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/newticket</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Saying that there are &quot;often&quot; broken links is just about as pointless 
</I>&gt;<i> as saying that you &quot;often&quot; find bugs.  Without specifics, this is not 
</I>&gt;<i> useful information; the reason we have not fixed specific problems is 
</I>&gt;<i> not because we believe there are no problems anywhere.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They talk about &quot;resource trees&quot;, yet I don't find them in the doc. I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> find
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> putchild() but all examples and docs indicate, that you can do it only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> within the root resource.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can do putChild to any resource, as long as you understand its 
</I>&gt;<i> lifecycle.  A &quot;resource tree&quot; is simply a tree ( 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure</A> ) of resources ( 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.web.resource.IResource.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.web.resource.IResource.html</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our documentation assumes, and will continue to assume, a certain 
</I>&gt;<i> level of familiarity with basic computer-sciency jargon; if you feel 
</I>&gt;<i> that a particular phrase is too obscure, feel free to submit a patch 
</I>&gt;<i> elaborating on it.  However, the audience of the bulk of the Twisted 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation is fluent Python programmers.  If you want to write 
</I>&gt;<i> something for folks who are new to Python or programming in general, a 
</I>&gt;<i> separate set of documentation would be better than trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> re-explain everything in-line.  For example, explaining that we are 
</I>&gt;<i> referring to a directed graph of IResource providers would be fine, 
</I>&gt;<i> but adding an explanation of graphs or how python references or 
</I>&gt;<i> dictionaries work would not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OK, a little later, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have my first web server running an my first rpy works, spitting out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;test&quot;. Wow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like the docs are doing their job, then :).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm wondering, why of all things &quot;rpy&quot; ? python won't generate sth. like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;rpyc&quot; for that, which translates in lost speed, I assume. No 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explanation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;rpy&quot; to mark the file as a specific kind of python file that needs to 
</I>&gt;<i> be run within the web server to produce a resource.  Implemented in 
</I>&gt;<i> this manner, python would not generate a &quot;pyc&quot; file even if it were 
</I>&gt;<i> called a &quot;.py&quot;; it is not a module that you import.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as &quot;lost speed&quot; is concerned, it's not entirely clear that 
</I>&gt;<i> that's true, because the times when Python would have to check for the 
</I>&gt;<i> .rpyc are entirely different than the way that it does when you are 
</I>&gt;<i> importing modules.  Twisted could emit .rpycs as an optimization if 
</I>&gt;<i> you did a benchmark, discovered it did indeed matter, and submitted a 
</I>&gt;<i> patch.  This is, however, hardly the highest priority for twisted.web 
</I>&gt;<i> developers right now :).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm on FreeBSD. Of course, I want to use kqueue. Now, another &quot;funny&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> journey begins ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Intense googleing, and I mean &quot;intense&quot;. Reading through years of this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mailing list. No positive result.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough.  The kqueue reactor doesn't work and there's no 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation saying that it doesn't, except a failing buildbot: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/freebsd-py2.4-kq">http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/freebsd-py2.4-kq</A> - also, 
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted's support for platforms is not clearly explained.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have the clear impression that twisted is something in between a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> toy and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> brilliant product. It's hackers, however, leave much to be desired in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> terms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of usefulness. As it is, it's a great and promising hobby but not a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> useful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> product.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many, many people (including me!) disagree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that you're frustrated, but this does nothing but serve 
</I>&gt;<i> to weaken your position.  You have some valid criticism, but when I 
</I>&gt;<i> read &quot;twisted is not useful&quot;, I think that you are simply mistaken.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry, but doc strings don't replcae a halfway decent documentation 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasonable tutorial, considering the highly complex matter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First google hit for &quot;twisted tutorial&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/tutorial/index.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/tutorial/index.html</A> 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not perfect, perhaps, but I think it could definitely be described as 
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;reasonable tutorial&quot; to core Twisted concepts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry, but documentation that is often enough outdated and sometimes 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> broken links is next to useless.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you were truly sorry, you would be contributing patches which fix 
</I>&gt;<i> the broken links and updates the documentation to be more recent.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kqueue seems to be vital to an event driven approach like TM, yet 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiple versions of pykqueue floating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around, none of them properly working (and I didn't fumble around. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plain simply used the FreeBSD port), some of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them with some mor and some with some less &quot;annotations&quot; (I refuse to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> call that doc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kqueue is most definitely _not_ &quot;vital&quot; to something like Twisted.  It 
</I>&gt;<i> is an optimization of a very specific part of a Twisted application on 
</I>&gt;<i> a very specific platform.  *Most* realistic Twisted applications will 
</I>&gt;<i> be bottlenecked on application code long before something like kqueue 
</I>&gt;<i> (or epoll) will help.  Working from the amount of support from the 
</I>&gt;<i> community, most Twisted applications also don't run on FreeBSD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I apologize if this response seems too harsh, but I am annoyed by 
</I>&gt;<i> people seeing a pet feature (variously: good ideas like HTTP/1.1, 
</I>&gt;<i> kqueue, and Cocoa GUI support, bad ideas like &quot;block on a Deferred&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> and core API thread safety)  which isn't too important in Twisted and 
</I>&gt;<i> then claiming it's &quot;vital&quot; to the project's success.  The project is 
</I>&gt;<i> succeeding, so clearly it is not vital: QED.  It may be important to 
</I>&gt;<i> you: that's great. Do some work to support it.  Once it's supported, 
</I>&gt;<i> buildbot will listen to its tests and it won't break again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For those projects which really do benefit from high multiplexing 
</I>&gt;<i> volume with something like kqueue, Twisted offers an extremely 
</I>&gt;<i> abstract API where the multiplexing mechanism is independent of the 
</I>&gt;<i> application code. You can, at any moment, replace the reactor and your 
</I>&gt;<i> application will keep working.  So even if kqueue support does not 
</I>&gt;<i> exist at all, you can add it with Twisted much more easily than if you 
</I>&gt;<i> wrote your own select() loop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You might say, in fact, that Twisted is vital to a platform-specific 
</I>&gt;<i> tool like Kqueue, because otherwise almost nothing will use it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - How about getting 1 version of pykqueue properly running and into TM ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, how about that?  Maybe you could contribute to one of the 
</I>&gt;<i> numerous kqueue tickets already in the tracker.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - How about freezing some TM version (like 8.0) and updating/matching 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> docs?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Of course, experiments are funny and intriguing, but quite some of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> us out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> here need sth. stable for everydays work)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted is very, very stable.  The next version (8.1) will break only 
</I>&gt;<i> code that is using APIs which have been outdated for literally 
</I>&gt;<i> _years_. There is no need to &quot;freeze&quot; anything, just update the 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation to what is most recent and do a new release including 
</I>&gt;<i> that documentation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - How about writing some complete docs and tutorials? Sth. along the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lines
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of &quot;My first web server wit TM&quot; (instead all those - sometimes 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seeming to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contradict each other - snippets)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, how about that?  You can write documentation on your own site, 
</I>&gt;<i> and we will link to it.  Or, you could contribute to the core 
</I>&gt;<i> documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The bottom line: complaining like this is not very useful.  If you 
</I>&gt;<i> have time to help, then contributing patches and responding to reviews 
</I>&gt;<i> in the tracker is helpful.  If you don't have the time to actually do 
</I>&gt;<i> any work, then describing specific problems (in as much detail as 
</I>&gt;<i> possible!) is useful.  If you don't have time even for _that_, then 
</I>&gt;<i> cash donations to the foundation are useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are interested in getting stuff in Twisted fixed, though, 
</I>&gt;<i> writing rambling complaints serves to do nothing but reduce our 
</I>&gt;<i> developers' already scarce motivation, make us think our work is not 
</I>&gt;<i> appreciated, and encourage us to spend time writing rambling responses 
</I>&gt;<i> like this one rather than fix the problems you're talking about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Which is not to say this has been a _complete_ waste of time.  If one 
</I>&gt;<i> out of every fifty people I write a message like this to understands 
</I>&gt;<i> what I'm saying and becomes a long-time contributor, then it's 
</I>&gt;<i> probably worth it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Hello,

there are links that are always broken, like for example : 
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/process.html,">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/process.html,</A> 
if you look at this line :

&quot;If you only need the final exit code (like 
|<i>commands.getstatusoutput(cmd)[0]|), the 
</I>|<i>twisted.internet.utils.getProcessValue 
</I>&lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/twisted.internet.utils.getProcessValue">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/twisted.internet.utils.getProcessValue</A>&gt;| 
function is useful.&quot;

The link being : 
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/twisted.internet.utils.getProcessValue">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/twisted.internet.utils.getProcessValue</A>

All those types of links in the howtos/tutorials are bad. Should I write 
a bugreport? If so, would an explanation like the one above suffice (I 
can't find all the links in the tutorials that are bad)?

Gabriel
