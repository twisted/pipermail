</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>it does :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>transport.registerProducer(self, 1)
</I>&gt;<i>       self.produce()
</I>
So, this is a streaming producer.  It starts producing right away without
having resumeProducing called on it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>thus starting the writing process and in the pull producer :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://itamarst.org/writings/OSCON03/twisted_internet-111.html">http://itamarst.org/writings/OSCON03/twisted_internet-111.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>it doesn't need to start the writing process explicitly since it's started 
</I>&gt;<i>when the producer is registered.
</I>
This is a non-streaming producer.  It doesn't do anything until something
calls resumeProducing on it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Oh, and also, since from what I see in the code the only difference with a 
</I>&gt;<i>push and pull producer is that the push producer is paused if the data being 
</I>&gt;<i>written/sent is very large (to let the reactor breath and process other 
</I>&gt;<i>things), if it isn't larger than the buffer it behaves like a pull producer, 
</I>&gt;<i>correct? If so, then why have both? Am I mixed up again?
</I>
As you say, they behave differently when there is a large amount of data.
However, this is more about the source of the data than where it ends up.
For example, if you have a large string and you want to producer it to a
transport, you probably want a pull producer, because there's no events
which will signal that you can send some more of the string *except* for
the reactor deciding that it is ready for some more.  So that's how you
should decide which of these you want to write - if the consumer is the
only event source involved, as in the large string case, then you want a
pull producer (streaming = False); if the producer itself is event-driven
in its ability to provide data, then you want a push producer.
