</I>Ok, but if connection1 comes, it does some processing by using a thread 
or a process (with twisted's functions) and connection2 comes, will 
connection2 wait for connection1 to finish, or will connection1 be put 
on the side while it waits for the thread and connection 2 is taken. 
Also, what event makes the next connection be

 think what I don't get is that with thread network code, each thread is 
an individual self-contained unit that does whatever processing it needs 
to do however long it may need to take, and the OS takes care of 
scheduling each thread, but with twisted, the main thread executes each 
connection one by one sequentially and thus if one of them needs to to 
some lengthy processing, it will block all other connections from being 
processed, so you have to use threads to keep it from blocking, but 
somehow the active connection should become inactive while the 
processing thread does it's work, so that another connection can be 
processed in the meantime. Is that how it works? So twisted's event loop 
(reactor) does the same work as the OS's scheduler?

Thanks
