<PRE>Hi Paul:

&gt;<i>I would like to provide an environment where
</I>&gt;<i>developers can write call servicing applications with
</I>&gt;<i>no knowledge of the network. I had rested on a
</I>&gt;<i>coroutine approach, whereby a developer could write
</I>&gt;<i>something like this:
</I>
I posted some code a little while ago that has WS-BPEL
logic riding on top of Stackless and Twisted. 

&gt;<i>Am I correct in thinking that while a developer's
</I>code
&gt;<i>is executing, all other connections are paused, and
</I>&gt;<i>that the twisted server will not accept new
</I>&gt;<i>connections until it returns?
</I>
[From the Schmitt Reactor Pattern Paper]

&gt;<i>Non-preemptive. In a single-threaded application
</I>&gt;<i>process, event handlers are not preempted while they
</I>&gt;<i>are executing. This implies that an event handler
</I>&gt;<i>should not perform blocking I/O on an individual
</I>&gt;<i>handle since this will block the entire process and
</I>&gt;<i>impede the responsiveness for clients connected to
</I>&gt;<i>other handles.
</I>
If you accept the Schmitt explanation, I would suggest
that it is convenient to think of Twisted as a
non-preemptive threading system where callbacks and
server protocol instances are user space &quot;threads of
execution&quot; and the reactor is the scheduler. Since a
&quot;thread&quot; cannot be involuntarily be pre-empted, the
reactor will not have a chance to trigger callbacks. 

Moral of the story - you don't want to do long CPU
intensive work in a callback.

&gt;<i>My original assumption was that Twisted would spawn a
</I>&gt;<i>new thread within which the scheduler would be set to
</I>&gt;<i>run to manage the communication for the duration of
</I>&gt;<i>the customer call/interaction.
</I>
I think you want reactor.callInThread(). I remember
Philip Mayers telling me about this in a post about a
year ago.

Here is an example - forget the Stackless stuff

<A HREF="http://stacklessexamples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/twisted/TwistedWebserverThreaded.py">http://stacklessexamples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/twisted/TwistedWebserverThreaded.py</A>

(Actually I would rather like to forget that piece of
code altogether)

However you may want to think over your design if you
find you need to extensively use OS threads. 

I would be tempted to ask myself questions like:

1)Is my application CPU or I/O bound&quot;? 
2)Can I encapsulate the message exchange pattern
between the client and the server be done in a single
protocol&quot;?
3)Can I conveniently yield the thread at predictable
points?

&gt;<i>Or, twisted is a framework whereby the response to a
</I>&gt;<i>network event is expect to arrive immediately.
</I>
I think the exact opposite is true, that is why the
deferred object exists. 

I would suggest Twisted is ideal for reactive, I/O
bound applications particularly when you can represent
the message exchange pattern in a single protocol.

Cheers,
Andrew
