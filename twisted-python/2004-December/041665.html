Trunk is pretty stable, but you'd have to do a manual copy of some sort
to install, setup.py may no longer work.

</I>
That's 2.0 only, yeah.

&gt;<i> Also, what is the recommended reactor these days for a system that 
</I>&gt;<i> receives a good bit of load, both from the external world and from 
</I>&gt;<i> within a cluster of Twisted-using systems that communicate over PB? (We

</I>
Still pollreactor.

&gt;<i> Have there been any major API changes that would break code, especially 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff that used PB?  (Does cBanana still work? It apparently isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> automatically used any longer...)
</I>
Probably not, but best to just try it and run. cBanana may have been
disabled for security reasons, I forget.

&gt;<i> Long ago, I had some woven-using code, but then that was deprecated in 
</I>&gt;<i> favor of nevow.  What's the current recommendation in this area?
</I>
Ask on the twisted-web list, but it's still nevow.

&gt;<i> I didn't see any obvious place to look for most of this info and the 
</I>&gt;<i> changelog isn't really the right level of granularity, so any help would 
</I>&gt;<i> be much appreciated.
</I>
We certainly haven't added any major incompatible changes intentionally,
but that doesn't guarantee the software will work. Best to try and see.
