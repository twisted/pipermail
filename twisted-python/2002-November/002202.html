&gt;<i> I agree that \n would probably be preferable, this was just
</I>&gt;<i> sloppyness on my part in the initial implementation.  I think it
</I>&gt;<i> could be changed in such a way so as not to break existing code, but
</I>&gt;<i> allow new code to use \n (similar to how LineReceiver works), and I
</I>&gt;<i> think this would be a good thing to do.
</I>
That would be good. As a Windows user, I have a lot of experience with
nasty LF/CRLF issues. Most of them respond reasonably well to the &quot;be
liberal in what you accept and strict in what you produce&quot; philosophy.

&gt;<i>   Hmmm.  I have an {indeterminant}-term goal of creating a better backend
</I>&gt;<i> interface.  If this isn't a pressing concern for you now, I'd rather put it
</I>&gt;<i> off until that happened (though I'd have no problem if you sent a patch that
</I>&gt;<i> made the necessary changes).
</I>
That's fine by me - I don't have a major issue with this. What I'll do
(if and when I get the time) is to post a copy of the design I used
for my backend interface - it may be of interest.

&gt;<i> I've been away a while, so maybe you've already gone ahead and done
</I>&gt;<i> some of this?  If not, I might have a crack at it myself.  I'll wait
</I>&gt;<i> to hear what, if anything, you've done thus far though.
</I>
Unfortunately, events overtook me, and I haven't had a chance to get
back to this yet. When I do, I have 2 things to look at - on the one
hand, I need to complete the job of implementing the news server I
needed this for in the first place, and in the second, I'd like to
help by supplying some patches. I suspect that getting the job done
may have to take priority, though :-)

I'll keep looking at this, though, and discuss further with you.

Paul.
