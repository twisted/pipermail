  Glad to hear it :)

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>    \r\n.. to \r\n. in the data the backend supplies - this should be

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
  Oops, thanks for the report.

&gt;<i> 3. It would be nice if the server handled the translation to CRLF, so
</I>&gt;<i>    that backends could return data with lines separated by \n, and the
</I>&gt;<i>    server class would convert that to \r\n. After all, \n is the
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;normal&quot; end of line character internal to Python code, and \r\n is
</I>&gt;<i>    a feature of the NNTP protocol, so the protocol driver should be
</I>&gt;<i>    responsible for the conversion (IMHO). Of course, this is a
</I>&gt;<i>    behaviour change, which could break existing backends, so maybe
</I>&gt;<i>    it's not practical to make this change.
</I>
  I agree that \n would probably be preferable, this was just sloppyness on
my part in the initial implementation.  I think it could be changed in such
a way so as not to break existing code, but allow new code to use \n
(similar to how LineReceiver works), and I think this would be a good thing
to do.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. The implementation of STAT requests the article from the
</I>&gt;<i>    backend. This could be inefficient if getting the message ID is
</I>&gt;<i>    cheap, but getting the full article is expensive for a particular
</I>&gt;<i>    backend (it will be for me). In my partly-implemented NNTP server
</I>&gt;<i>    written in &quot;raw&quot; Python (before I found Twisted) I had a backend
</I>&gt;<i>    method getArticle(..., head=1, body=1) which was used to implement
</I>&gt;<i>    all of HEAD, BODY, ARTICLE and STAT, just by setting different
</I>&gt;<i>    values for the head and body parameters (so the backend could check
</I>&gt;<i>    for the case where neither was required, and act accordingly).
</I>
  Hmmm.  I have an {indeterminant}-term goal of creating a better backend
interface.  If this isn't a pressing concern for you now, I'd rather put it
off until that happened (though I'd have no problem if you sent a patch that
made the necessary changes).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (2) is obviously fairly trivial. I think I could implement (3) and
</I>&gt;<i> (4), if it would be useful. I could submit a patch, which would alter
</I>&gt;<i> the server code and the 2 existing backends (I couldn't test the
</I>&gt;<i> database backend, as I don't have a database to test with, but I could
</I>&gt;<i> test the pickle-based code). Would this be helpful? Are there likely
</I>&gt;<i> to be 3rd party nntp backends which would be broken by such a change?
</I>
  I've been away a while, so maybe you've already gone ahead and done some
of this?  If not, I might have a crack at it myself.  I'll wait to hear
what, if anything, you've done thus far though.
