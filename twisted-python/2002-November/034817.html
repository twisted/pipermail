<PRE>Hey all,

Some time ago, when the major changes to Woven started to happen, Glyph 
and/or Donovan were going to write up what the planned changes were and 
where Woven was going.

I've got a fairly large amount of code using old Woven and am going to 
be faced soon with upgrading it to current Woven.

Can someone provide some sort of actual explanation of how Woven works 
today and what some of the typical usages are?  I already walked through 
the old Woven and figured it out back then, but I don't have the time to 
re-do that work.

Also, it would be nice if large architectural changes were posted about 
as changes were made so that people who aren't on the IRC channel could 
keep up with things.

Thanks,

  - Bruce
