</I>&gt;<i> &gt; While developing my twisted.im bot (new this week! database access and an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; infobot-style plugin!) I've come up against two seperate annoyances. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; patch fixes both of them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Glad you're making progress!  I'm sorry that twisted.im is annoying you :-(.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully I can give some guidance as to how it's _supposed_ to work...
</I>
Oh, neat.

To be truthful, most of it is pretty nifty. :)

I'd be interested to see if my bot also works with AIM and
twisted.words, though - I don't have an account with either so I can't
test... is anyone working on a Jabber protocol for Twisted? :)

&gt;<i> &gt; Number 1: the IRC protocol defines (among other things) two message types -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; privmsg and notice. They are identical in every respect except that a notice
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; must not be automatically replied to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Except when they should be automatically replied to.  Such as the notice that
</I>&gt;<i> NickServ gives you upon login, or one of the various notices that older
</I>&gt;<i> spambots will generate in response to a VERSION directive.
</I>
Oh. That's a right pain, that is.

&gt;<i> This is one of the worse excresences of the IRC protocol and I'd like to not
</I>&gt;<i> see promoted to the higher levels of abstractions in twisted.im.  What you're
</I>&gt;<i> semantically communicating is metadata about the message (&quot;please don't
</I>&gt;<i> autorespond to this (unless you really want to)&quot;) and not a wholly different
</I>&gt;<i> type of message.  So I've committed a different fix :-).  The &quot;metadata&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> dictionary passesd to showMessage and showGroupMessage is designed to
</I>&gt;<i> encapsulate this sort of protocol-specific need, so IRC &quot;notice&quot; messages will
</I>&gt;<i> have an entry in the metadata dictionary of {&quot;dontAutoRespond&quot;: 1}.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I just committed a fix that does this... if you're using CVS, your bot can now
</I>&gt;<i> check for that flag in the metadata dict and drop the message on the floor
</I>&gt;<i> appropriately.
</I>
Heh. I was going to post 'how about I just dump it in the metadata
dict' and look into writing a patch later today. Thanks!

&gt;<i> For t.im's default use case (end-user chat application) whether or not robots
</I>&gt;<i> should automatically respond to a certain type of message is completely
</I>&gt;<i> irrelevant to its display.
</I>
Indeed

&gt;<i> &gt; Number 2: [ ... ] twisted.im.ircsupport by default prints an error
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message for each unknown command it recieves. Slashnet in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; particular seems to like to send a lot of them, and it clutters up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; my screen. This patch simply comments out the print statement and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; adds a 'pass'.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm... that behavior should at least be customizeable with a flag...
</I>&gt;<i> I personally have used that console output a number of times, and it
</I>&gt;<i> has been invaluable in debugging certain things in twisted.im on
</I>&gt;<i> various occasions. 
</I>
When I was doing IRC-specific things, I too have found it incredibly
useful. But, being unconcerned with low-level details of the protocol
at the moment, I find it annoying.

&gt;<i> If you don't want the output going to the
</I>&gt;<i> console, there should be a separate log.  Perhaps you could
</I>&gt;<i> specifically ignore the slashnet message types you don't want?
</I>
My theory was that if a developer wanted that level of detail from
ircsupport.py, they could just go and uncomment the print statement.
