Can you expound a little more on which example you're talking about?  &quot;the
example [...] (Example)&quot; is not very specific in a framework as large as
Twisted.

&gt;<i> Specs :
</I>
&gt;<i> 1. os --&gt; windows 98
</I>&gt;<i> 2. python --&gt; python-2.2.2
</I>
It should work, though I would recommend upgrading to a more sane version of
Windows whenever you've got the chance :-)

&gt;<i> This is my autoexec.bat :
</I>
&gt;<i> @SET PYTHONPATH=C:\python22\lib\site-packages\twisted\
</I>&gt;<i> @SET PYTHONPATH=C:\web2\TWISTEDQUOTES\;C:\WEB2\MOHAN_KOTEH\
</I>
@echo %PYTHONPATH%

will probably show you that your PYTHONPATH is
&quot;C:\web2\TWISTEDQUOTES\;C:\WEB2\MOHAN_KOTEH&quot;; if you want to add things to the
path rather than reset it entirely, you want it to look like:

    @SET PYTHONPATH=C:\python22\lib\site-packages\twisted\
    @SET PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\web2\TWISTEDQUOTES\;C:\WEB2\MOHAN_KOTEH\

IIRC.  However, I don't understand what you're trying to do here.  If you have
Twisted installed in your C:\python22\lib\site-packages (as with setup.py or
the .exe installer) then you shouldn't be adding anything to your PYTHONPATH to
get 'twisted' to import.

&gt;<i> i can't seem to get the Example even to compile and looking through the docs
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't seem to help much. One question can i use the --personal option on a
</I>&gt;<i> windows machine ?
</I>
No.  Windows doesn't have the notion of unix sockets.  Even if you could, there
wouldn't be much of a point: windows security (especially on 9x!) is even more
of a disaster than UNIX, so separating privileges between processes doesn't
help much of anything if you're running them on the same machine.

Why do you think you want the --personal option?  It's designed for multi-user
servers where you've got lots of different people running webservers and you
want them all to be accessible through port 80.

&gt;<i> I get an error that says it cannot find the pwd module. Can someone please
</I>&gt;<i> help me or at least point me somewhere where there are some docs ???
</I>
The pwd module is for determining your UNIX username and home directory (which,
surprise, you don't have ^_^).  The --personal option is pretty much useless to
you.
