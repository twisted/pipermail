I *think* twisted.web.guard has this functionality... I've heard it's going
to be overhauled at some point, it's not as nice as it could be.

I'm even less of a twisted.mail expert than a twisted.web expert, but I
think that twisted.mail's auth stuff predates twisted.cred, and we haven't
had time to migrate it to twisted.cred yet.

Indeed.  Our docs are slowly improving, but still quite lacking.  If you or
anyone can contribute any, that would be great!

Hmm.  That looks like a dubious change to me.  Wouldn't that fail for
headers like:
    To: Mr. Example &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">dude at example.com</A>&gt;

I'm not familiar with smtp.py though...

&gt;<i> I am unfortunately locked on a win$ platform for my development so many

Well...

1. Twisted doesn't require any C modules to be compiled -- they're basically
   just optional speed-ups.  In fact the only C module in Twisted that works
   on Windows is cBanana; cReactor and portmap don't apply to Windows
   because it doesn't have the relevant APIs.

2. I've heard it's possible to use the mingw port of gcc to compile python
   extensions... search comp.lang.python or google for details.

&gt;<i> Oops the very last is this one: are ALL tests supposed to work

</I>
Eek.  The UI shouldn't crash, but regardless usually I use &quot;runtests -t&quot;,
i.e. run in text mode.

Unfortunately Win32 support isn't 100% -- which tests are failing for you?

&gt;<i> Alright I'll stop my whining here for now and thank you very much for

</I>
Thanks :)
