</I>&gt;<i> &quot;implement feature foo for Win32EventsReactor&quot;.
</I>
And to refine this even further:

It's OK for the patches to be smaller than &quot;implement feature foo&quot;, as long as they make sense on their own.

For example if we already implement feature foo, but you want to re-factor it so that it's easy to implement feature bar in terms of that same code, you could have a ticket just for doing the inner refactoring, that does not expose any new public classes or features, as long as that refactoring has a good explanation and a good impact on the internal API.

Based on the last patch I see on this ticket, it looks like that's what you're trying to do with a lot of the 'Channel' objects; these need better documentation and test coverage, but it looks like some of that work could be off on its own.
