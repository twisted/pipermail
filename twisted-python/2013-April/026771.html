<PRE>Hi,

I&#8217;ve asked this one already at the Twisted dinner (thanks again for it, it was probably my PyCon highlight) and got various answers from people sitting around me. I&#8217;m still indecisive so I&#8217;d like to gather even more opinions[1]. I already tried to ask on IRC but my time zone is just not very #twisted friendly so I got zero replies.

My question can be simplified to: Closures yes or no?

They seem *really* handy since they allow to have some data present without handing it through all the time. Eg in my cred checker, I can refer to the user name from the closure instead of passing it around all the time &#8211; making the code much cleaner. Also most current examples and callbacks-are-hard-FUD-rebuttals seem to use them.

OTOH, private methods like `_cbPrintResult` are nicer to test individually.

If &#8220;yes, closures&#8221;: Still using cb/eb prefixes? I don&#8217;t see them very often in recent examples. What about addBoth handlers?

Bonus points for the preferred style for the Twisted code base.

Thanks in advance &amp; thank you for your time,
Hynek

[1]: I&#8217;d be glad if people from the dinner replied again too so I/we have it in written form, my memory tends to be rather sloppy.
