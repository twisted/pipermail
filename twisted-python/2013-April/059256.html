&gt;<i> Hey everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> During the latest release process, I was left with several things to
</I>&gt;<i> clarify, so now that it's done I think it's time:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * We started building wheels for Windows. What do we do with me, should

</I>
We should definitely upload them to PyPI.  Right now, users won't even get them unless they explicitly say &quot;pip --use-wheel&quot;, so there's not much risk associated with it.  When users try them, they should just get a working installation instead of what happens now ;).

&gt;<i> * Glyph mumbled something about sha sums of the release files, instead
</I>&gt;<i> of md5. Should we pursue that? We may need to update some trac
</I>&gt;<i> integration code.
</I>
We should.  If we're signing them, it's for security.  If it's for security, we should use a secure hash.  Let's skip sha1 and go straight to sha512 or something.

&gt;<i> * There are several issues with SVN and the release branch. First the
</I>&gt;<i> Quotes file conflicts almost all the time. But this time we also
</I>&gt;<i> reverted a branch from trunk during the release, and then merged it
</I>&gt;<i> again, which created all sorts of troubles. Maybe we (I) just need to
</I>&gt;<i> write some documentation about it. But if anyone has an idea on how to
</I>&gt;<i> improve our tools, they are welcome.
</I>
I think that as long as we're still using an old version of SVN, documentation is the only solution.  Also we should have fewer bugs that need reverting :).
