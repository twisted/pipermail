</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As far as I can tell, the defaults are currently beyond plain old DSA. It
appears this support has been in GnuPG since 2006 and in PGP since at least
then, I would guess that it's been commonly available since 2008 or so. I'm
not sure *why* it's DSA now, but I'm hoping the GPG people had good reasons
:<i>) (I'm guessing it's &quot;adoption was sufficient that by the time we
</I>considered changing the default the reasons were no longer valid&quot;)

For DSA, GPG selects the first hash algorithm in your digest preference
list that is of size &gt;= q. q is the hash size for your DSA key, which is
hardcoded into the key. The defaults in GPG are:

q = 160 for 1024 bit keys (i.e. plain old DSA)
q = 224 for 1024 to 2048 bit keys
q = 256 bit for 2048 to 3072 bit keys

You can use gpg --list-packets to view this, but the output is a little
obscure. It's easier to use pgpdump, which, for my key produces (truncated
output):

====
Public Key Packet(tag 6)(1198 bytes)
Ver 4 - new
Public key creation time - Sun Oct 14 13:56:19 UTC 2012
Pub alg - DSA Digital Signature Algorithm(pub 17)
DSA p(3072 bits) - ...
DSA q(256 bits) - ...
DSA g(3068 bits) - ...
DSA y(3071 bits) - ...
====

The important bit is the q value: 256. Combined with my digest algorithm
preferences, that means I'll get SHA-256 (first hash of sufficient size),
not truncated (since 256 == 256 ;)).

I guess this is drifting off-topic though...
&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure thing :D I wasn't trying to argue for any particular algorithm, but
simply that:

- if you have a recent key of maximum allowable size for whatever the
default was on your system, you're probably fine
- signing a bunch of SHA sums is fine, provided it's SHA-256 or better,
preferably SHA-512 (SHA-3 wouldn't be wrong, but isn't commonly supported
yet, and SHA-2 has withstood attempts to break it so far better than anyone
anticipated, so we're good).

cheers
