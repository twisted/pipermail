</I>&gt;<i> I agree. Can't we just replace &quot;md5sum&quot; in the command line with &quot;shasum -a 512&quot;? Do we need a grace period where we deliver both the MD5 and SHA512 sums? (Perhaps there's an automated system out there that relies on the MD5 version being available, since that's all we have now.)
</I>
Signing both certainly doesn't create any problems.  I just have no idea what automation stuff parses this file as part of our _own_ release process.  I was hoping someone who knew how it worked could examine it and tell me.
