</I>&gt;<i> retrofitting all of them; not to mention dealing with broad-spectrum
</I>&gt;<i> deprecations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A better use of energy would be directed at getting a generic SASL

</I>For what it's worth, I worked on this back when, and while I don't have
time to work on it right now (and probably won't for at least a couple of
weeks), I'm happy to answer questions, if anybody has them.

Mostly what needed to happen was to merge the code in the branch with the
code in trunk which had diverged somewhat, and create some documentation on
how to use them.

My recollection was that integrating the results of that with specific
protocols (and possibly with Cred using a &quot;higher level&quot; interface) would
happen on a subsequent ticket, which is probably a good idea.


&gt;<i> A well-implemented SASL credentials interface will address these issues,
</I>&gt;<i> as well as allowing for proper challenge-response authentication, digest
</I>&gt;<i> auth, external auth mechanisms like TLS, et cetera.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your idea about adapters is well taken though; having the portal do that
</I>&gt;<i> when SASL-ified checkers are available seems reasonable, provided that it
</I>&gt;<i> won't break anything.
