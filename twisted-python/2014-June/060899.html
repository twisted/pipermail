This is a nice thought but I think it's entirely misguided.

Overcoming simplistic, automated obstacles is what spammers have been 
learning how to do extremely well for several decades now.  If you 
choose to participate in this arms race with them, you can win by put in 
slightly more effort than them - from now until forever.

Considering the Twisted project apparently lacks even the ability to put 
a slight bit of effort even once (at least, not without gathering its 
strength to do so for two or three months first), this doesn't strike me 
as likely to happen.

Also, Apache isn't used anywhere on twistedmatrix.com so it would be 
rather difficult to deploy anything based on mod_security anyway.
