&gt;<i> Ok, 3 points.

</I>&gt;<i> 1) I think 0.9.0 should be feature-complete with 1.0, and 0.9.* only be bug

</I>
The gimp-style versioning is intentional.  I think that 0.99.* indicates 
&quot;slogging towards 1.0!!&quot; whereas 0.9 seems like a decent release in its own 
right.  I'll vote (i.e. use my divine mandate to dictate) that we keep it 
that way :)

&gt;<i> 2) package-izing of web. I think this needs to be done (we have webconfig
</I>&gt;<i> and webutils in twisted, and these should be web.config and web.utils).
</I>&gt;<i> I've been bitching about this for a very long time. I think it should be
</I>&gt;<i> done before 1.0. It makes sense to do it now, while the protocol handling
</I>&gt;<i> part of web is being factored out into protocols.http.
</I>
The trouble is that webutils and webconfig are not logically &quot;owned&quot; by web.  
webutils could grow into a separate distribution; webconfig might just as 
logically be config.web.  I don't see a compelling reason for organizing them 
in a package yet.  (Something like twisted.reality may bear packagizing, 
since twisted.library *is* logically &quot;owned&quot; by reality).

Also, anything called &quot;util&quot; is basically crying out for refactoring.  
Perhaps web and reality should both be packages and both have a &quot;library&quot; 
subpackage?  I dunno.  Suggestions are welcome.

&gt;<i> 3) Maybe releases &gt;1.0 should be a little more spread out numerically.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe not. I donno.
</I>
Well, there are 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3 releases in between, etc, that were not 
detailed.
