Sorry about that, I didn't notice 0.99.* before sending the last mail, and
dash straightened me out yesterday. :)

</I>
Yeah, web.library sounds good. webutils is basically the same as library,
only all classes are in the same file. And where to put webconfig is a toughy,
since it's related to both config and web. Which is more important? The way
it's implemented, or what it does? I think config.web seems more logical.
Then there could also be config.reality, config.gloop, etc. (when we get
around to it).
