Ok, I get you know. Good idea. :)

</I>&gt;<i> I don't really understand why this is relevant; why would you need IDs for

</I>
Exactly, servers really don't have IDs. But other things do. That's why I was
confused in the first place. But it is useful to have them for the UI.
str(serverObj) may not be that user friendly, but it has to be unique.
Also the ID is needed for deleting things from the selector.

Now that I think of it, with your dict and list overriding ideas, I don't
think IDs would even be needed. Or maybe they would. I'll work on it. :)

&gt;<i> &gt; I already have that implemented. Remember config_strings and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; config_callbacks?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still not 100% comfortable with that implementation, but I suppose it can

Okie dokie.
