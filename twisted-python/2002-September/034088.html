Yes.  In fact, PyXML is a big part of the problem.  Its &quot;minidom&quot; module, for
example, is *far* buggier than the one found in the standard library.  (As an
example of that, try to figure out how to make cloneNode work on a Document
object.)

I could deal with one set of potential problems and pitfalls using XML in
Python and work around then, but I have to work around every combination of
versions to make a useful app that doesn't have very stringent installation
requirements: in pracitice this means 4 environments: python2.1 with pyxml,
python2.1 standalone, python2.2 with pyxml, python2.2 standalone.

I don't want a plethora of XML parsers with rich features, all of which are
broken.  I want *one* XML parser that can *reliably* transform a stream of
bytes into a stream of nodes, and a text file into a tree of nodes.  You
mentioned validatation in your post and I explicitly said that validation is
worse than useless to me; in most cases I want to parse XHTML, which means
dealing with lots of potentially DTD-violating stuff which is still &quot;valid&quot; as
far as I'm concerned.

Eventually I'll clean up the problem cases I'm having and submit them as bug
reports, but right now it's not worth my time, because I really don't want to
deal with the fragility of the PyXML or python-standard-library xml.* stuff.
