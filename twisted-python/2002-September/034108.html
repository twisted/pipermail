</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; You see, this is why reporting such &quot;bugs&quot; early is helpful.  I could have 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; told you ages ago that it is a *bad* idea to call cloneNode on a Document 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; object.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Accordin to the DOM Level 2 spec:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;And, cloning Document, DocumentType, Entity, and Notation nodes is 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; implementation dependent.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's no reason to think its a bad idea to implement it or need it,
</I>&gt;<i> just that you can't rely on it being supported by an arbitrary DOM
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.
</I>
OK.  So what should it mean to clone any of these node types?  I can't hardly 
imagine anything that doesn't run into circular madness.  I think the DOM WG 
refused to specify this for good reason.


&gt;<i>  &gt; I do agree that the confused error message is a glitch.  Current PyXML CVS 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; gives a more straightforward &quot;sod off&quot;  :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not quite; the previous message would have been raised calling
</I>&gt;<i> cloneNode() on a processing instruction as well.  Or calling it with
</I>&gt;<i> deep=1 on a portion of the tree that contained a processing
</I>&gt;<i> instruction.  That was a real bug, and not an arbitrary limitation.
</I>
OK.  Glad it's fixed, then.


&gt;<i>  &gt; We choose not to allow it.  Perfectly legal, and I think this is the right 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; choice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Honestly, I think we should implement cloneNode() for Document, simply
</I>&gt;<i> because not doing so seems an unnecessary limitation.  It is not for
</I>&gt;<i> the library to decide what is right for the application.
</I>
It's not arbitrary at all.  cloneNode is not supposed to alter the 
ownerDocument: that is for importNode to do.  So if you clone a document node, 
what happens?

Do you Create a new document (and thus docType) node and then effectively call 
importNode on the childNodes?  That's the only approach that makes sense to 
me.  Yet it's quite arbitrary and magical.  I would rather force people to be 
clear about what they're doing by manually creating another document and then 
calling importNode on all the childNodes of the original.

So I do not agree that we should support cloneNode for the 4 unspecified node 
types.


&gt;<i> I agree that not supporting it is legal.  The exception that is raised
</I>&gt;<i> is wrong: it should be xml.dom.NotSupportedErr.
</I>
There is no stipulation that such an exception should be thrown.  The behavior 
is impl dependent, and I don't see why that doesn't mean the implementation 
can choose to throw whatever exception it wishes.  However, I certainly do not 
object to a change to throwing xml.dom.NotSupportedErr.  I just don't think 
it's a bug that right now it doesn't.


&gt;<i>  &gt; This is the impetus for the Python-in-a-tie effort for Python
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; proper.  I do think we'd make a lot more friends if there were a
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; matching PyXML-in-a-tie.  It would mean companies would have to
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would be nice to have.  First task:  improve &amp; integrate all the
</I>&gt;<i> random piles of tests out there!  They should all be run when I type
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;make check&quot; at the top level, not just a handful.
</I>
Yes.  Build and test farms would be the main engine of such an effort.
