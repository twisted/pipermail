Well, those problems ended up being a major part of the larger set of 
problems.  They're fixed now in CVS after some debugging and then a good 
idea for the fix from Donovan.

I'm going to leave the existing bugs as documented above around still. 
I'm not entirely happy with my fix or sure that it doesn't occasionally 
do the wrong thing.
