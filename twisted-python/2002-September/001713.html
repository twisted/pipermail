I'd meant to suggest that we at least have some sort of policy on 
documentation that is as clearly stated as that for running tests.  I 
don't really care what the policy is, as long as the situation improves 
past the state that Twisted is currently in.

Agreed. And you could argue that Moshez's rudeness encouraged me to 
finally check in a tiny subset of the docs that I have in my tree and 
that's a good thing.

It'd be nice to see some further constructive discussion of this.  We'll 
also need to update the coding standard to reflect the usage of epydoc 
rather than HappyDoc as well.  There are probably other updates that 
could and should be made as well.

For anyone who's missed it, the Epydoc site (<A HREF="http://epydoc.sf.net/">http://epydoc.sf.net/</A>) has 
been updated with some docs.  It should be seeing a 1.0 release as well 
fairly soon, so now's a good time to contribute patches for features 
that we'd like to see in corporated.
