 &gt; You see, this is why reporting such &quot;bugs&quot; early is helpful.  I could have 
 &gt; told you ages ago that it is a *bad* idea to call cloneNode on a Document 
 &gt; object.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Accordin to the DOM Level 2 spec:
 &gt; 
 &gt; &quot;And, cloning Document, DocumentType, Entity, and Notation nodes is 
 &gt; implementation dependent.&quot;

That's no reason to think its a bad idea to implement it or need it,
just that you can't rely on it being supported by an arbitrary DOM
implementation.

 &gt; I do agree that the confused error message is a glitch.  Current PyXML CVS 
 &gt; gives a more straightforward &quot;sod off&quot;  :-)

Not quite; the previous message would have been raised calling
cloneNode() on a processing instruction as well.  Or calling it with
deep=1 on a portion of the tree that contained a processing
instruction.  That was a real bug, and not an arbitrary limitation.

 &gt; We choose not to allow it.  Perfectly legal, and I think this is the right 
 &gt; choice.

Honestly, I think we should implement cloneNode() for Document, simply
because not doing so seems an unnecessary limitation.  It is not for
the library to decide what is right for the application.

I agree that not supporting it is legal.  The exception that is raised
is wrong: it should be xml.dom.NotSupportedErr.

 &gt; If you try going this route, I guarantee you'll still be trying to get the 
 &gt; most basic things right six months from now.

Heck, we're still trying to get Expat right, and it isn't exactly the
freshest software around!

 &gt; This is the impetus for the Python-in-a-tie effort for Python
 &gt; proper.  I do think we'd make a lot more friends if there were a
 &gt; matching PyXML-in-a-tie.  It would mean companies would have to

That would be nice to have.  First task:  improve &amp; integrate all the
random piles of tests out there!  They should all be run when I type
&quot;make check&quot; at the top level, not just a handful.

 &gt; You pointed out one problem in cloneNode which, from what I gather,
 &gt; was mostly because you're abusing DOM.  This had nothing to do with

It is not at all clear that this is an abuse of the DOM, as I
explained above.
