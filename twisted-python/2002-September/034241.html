The tracebacks I was seeing were for wikis and viewcvs; either moin is setting
those headers or it's serving the images / static data from a personal server
directory.

&gt;<i> &gt; I thought that I'd mentioned this over IRC before, but let me stress it: I

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; now. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting position.  I know you're not a fan of complete support for a
</I>&gt;<i> protocol when you believe the protocol itself is broken, and I'll admit
</I>&gt;<i> that nobody actually uses ETags, but I would hardly say that
</I>&gt;<i> Last-Modified and HEAD are obscure or unnecessary.
</I>
Nor would I.  After much discussion with itamar I conceded that HEAD ought to
cause the body of the request to be eaten there before being sent to the
client.

What I mean here is that the actual module, twisted.web.server, is being too
smart about stuff like Last-Modified and ETags.  HTTP should be fully
implemented, but parts of the responsibility lie elsewhere.
twisted.web.Resource subclasses can implement those themselves if they want to,
because the 99.9% cases should be handled: static.File will handle filesystem
content and woven.* will handle dynamic content.  We can also provide a helper
for mix-in that does conditional-rendering stuff.

&gt;<i> &gt; First of all, this is killing performance -- you have a minimum of 4 or 5
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PB server/client interactions now for each conditional request instead of 2.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Those method calls are not cheap.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Recognized.  Although I thought I only increased the count by one, not
</I>&gt;<i> two or three?
</I>
Looking at it now, I guess ETags and last-modified support are exclusive.  (Is
this correct, protocol-wise?)  However, each call that requires an answer is
minimum of 2 interactions (request/response).  Plus most resources will want to
do a .write().

&gt;<i> Also take into consideration that these calls only happen for the
</I>&gt;<i> *conditional* requests.
</I>
The only heuristic I have for how often these happen are the once-per-minute
tracebacks I was seeing while bots were crawling the website yesterday.  So it
looked quite often. :)

&gt;<i> &gt; Second, this is exploding the complexity of the webserver: its goal should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be to get to the endpoint resource *as simply as possible* and then invoke
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; endpoint behavior on that resource.  If clever header-parsing things need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to happen, then we need to make a lower-level 'request' method and make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *it* clever, not do request processing before the request is dispatched.
</I>
&gt;<i> This I agree with.  I knew something was wrong when I had three remote
</I>&gt;<i> methods in ResourcePublisher all independently doing getResourceFor.  It
</I>&gt;<i> would be more symmetric if Request.process was invoked on the distri --
</I>
Right. :-)

&gt;<i> ggrngh.  What is Request.process anyway.  Is it just supposed to do
</I>&gt;<i> site.getResourceFor and pass itself off?  Yes.  All the rest of the junk
</I>&gt;<i> in there is stuff I added (though the HEAD/supportedMethods stuff was
</I>&gt;<i> quite some time ago) with the possible exception of the
</I>&gt;<i> util.Unauthorized block.  And it's probably all logic that belongs in
</I>&gt;<i> web..Resource rather than Request.
</I>
HEAD definitely ought to still have a little bit of logic in Request, since it
should discard any body that the resource attempts to return.  However, the
rest of what you're saying is definitely...

&gt;<i> ([...] just re-iterating what you've been telling me.)
</I>
&gt;<i> So how do we fix it?  You're suggesting that Request.process call
</I>&gt;<i> Resource.request, which contains most of the stuff currently in
</I>&gt;<i> Request.process, and Resource.request calls Resource.render if it's not
</I>&gt;<i> a conditional request?
</I>
See above for my suggestion.  I think that Resource is too low-level for this
sort of thing (since the default implementation of wasModifiedSince is going to
be 'return 1', why invoke it at all by default?).  I don't feel strongly that
my suggestion is better than this one though, if you think that dynamic
resource implementors are going to want to use this functionality a lot.
(Thoughts, Donovan?)

&gt;<i> Sounds like we need an inter-version test harness.  Runs peer1 under
</I>&gt;<i> version X and peer2 on Y, or starts server on version X, pickles it, and
</I>&gt;<i> re-starts under Y, etc.
</I>
Yes.  This is something that I think radix hacked up manually a little while
back, but it needs to be added to accepttests.

Sounds like we're in general agreement, then...
