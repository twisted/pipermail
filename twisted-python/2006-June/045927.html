I'm very sympathetic to this, and I'd really like for the SVN source  
tree to be arranged better than it is. The main constraint is keeping  
the ability to run from a svn checkout directly, without an install  
step. I made a branch that did reorganize things by subproject. And  
that pretty much worked fine except that trial gets totally confused  
when running regressions on it. I then also patched trial to make it  
not blow up.

However, that particular way of fixing trial was rejected, and no  
other has been implemented yet. Reorganization is essentially blocked  
until this issue is solved.
