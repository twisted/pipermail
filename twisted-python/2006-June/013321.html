Yes:  forward compatibility.  ;)   I've written PB code, too, and that
code doesn't work with newpb.  Not that I would expect it to, given the
fairly substantial changes Brian made in developing newpb, nor do I
think it would be good to have that as a constraint on newpb.

Given newpb's list of features:

<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/NewPB">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/NewPB</A>

... what would you *not* want??  ;)  But of course, you said &quot;need&quot;.
My impression is that newpb will be more scalable, which is something
my app will definitely need.  Also, the better serialization
architecture will be important, as some of my objects can be large.
And the serializability of &quot;most inert Python types&quot;, while not
essential, is very nice to have.  Also, my code is interface-driven,
for which newpb is better adapted (so to speak :).
