In the case of, for example, web1's IResource, callers are in framework code and callees are in application code.  Which means maybe two-dozen callers and like a billion callees.

In the case of the *new* IResource, this might not be the right factoring since you are really supposed to subclass stuff and not implement directly; and in any event, in the long term hopefully most people will be using nevow+web2 and avoiding touching the resource model directly.

&gt;<i>   The point being that callers of functions that _usually_ return  non-

</I>&gt;<i>with unit tests unless you go out of your way to ensure  that deferreds are 
</I>&gt;<i>tested, which is unlikely if you also wrote the  offending code.
</I>
Which reminds me.  Somebody really *should* be trying to get that C deferred stuff James did into Twisted proper; one Deferred for every locateChild sounds excruciatingly expensive for long URLs, as the code currently stands.
