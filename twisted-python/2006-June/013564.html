<PRE>tzahi,

it saddens me to say that you can't get it. the reason is simple: i can't 
get it either. i'd erroneously thought the code was backed up before i wiped 
a box, but that was not the case :( it is now lost, along with some other 
semi-useful stuff.

with that said, i don't think it would've been useful for what you were 
attempting - i was compressing the data before sending it over pb, while you 
seem to be interested in doing this automagically at the pb or transport 
level.

I am also very much interested in compressing the underlying transfers using
PB. Where can we get the hack? :)
I am looking for something that is done after serialization so all features 
of
jelly remains. I.e., just before transfer, compress the data. Preferably 
with
some control, i.e., with each message i send i want to be able to say
if to compress and to what level of compression.

Currently i have to circumvent jelly by pickle and compress but i can only
do that when server sends to client since the client trusts the server.
However the server does not trust the client and thus, cannot allow pickled
objects to be unserialized.

maybe something like callRemoteCompressed...
