</I>
Glyph, thanks for (finally ;) chiming in on this one!
I'm happy to hear that PB1 -&gt; PB2 ports shouldn't be too hard ...
so I'll just shut up and use PB1.  :)

&gt;<i> While wire-level compatibility might be desirable, I think that 
</I>&gt;<i> application-level compatibility should actually become a requirement.  
</I>&gt;<i> As you note, Steve, the only thing that the promise of a PB2 that will 
</I>&gt;<i> be totally incompatible with PB1 is doing is discouraging people from 
</I>&gt;<i> looking at either right now.
</I>
Well, it had definitely discouraged me from using PB1, partly because
Brian's commit messages were always so cogent and PB2 sounds so great,
I just thought damn, well I'll wait for that ...

&gt;<i> Other applications are already using PB though, and many are doing it to 
</I>&gt;<i> good effect.
</I>
Thanks -- another important thing to know.  (I admit, I'd probably
be more au courant if I'd tune in to irc once in a while!)

&gt;<i> So let me say this as unambiguously as possible:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PB1 is still supported, and until further notice, it will continue to 
</I>&gt;<i> be.  PB2 is still experimental and is *not* yet supported.  We might not 
</I>&gt;<i> have a lot of development bandwidth to spend on PB1, but bugs are still 
</I>&gt;<i> being fixed, deprecations removed, and APIs updated to reflect the 
</I>&gt;<i> modern state of Twisted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It can be updated and fixed incrementally while we wait for the Great 
</I>&gt;<i> Revolution of PB2.  Perhaps we can even start making the various APIs 
</I>&gt;<i> converge, so that the migration process will be smoother.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This isn't a new decision or announcement, just a statement of the 
</I>&gt;<i> current state of affairs.
</I>
Well, it certainly was a much-needed clarification, IMO, and it
helped my decision a great deal.  Thanks!

&gt;<i> ... Brian has been very clear about PB2's 
</I>&gt;<i> experimental status all along.
</I>
Agreed.  What I was not obvious was how long it would remain
experimental.  I can bleed for a while, but it's nice to have
some idea of how many pints I'll need ... ;)

&gt;<i> ... Maintenance on PB1 never stopped.  JP, 
</I>&gt;<i> for example, just recently removed a bunch of grotty old-cred stuff 
</I>&gt;<i> (hallelujiah it's gone) from PB1.
</I>
Right -- thanks, JP!  I do monitor commits, so I was aware that PB1
was being maintained, which is important for my decision.

&gt;<i> It just seems like because there's 
</I>&gt;<i> this new direction, everyone tacitly assumes that the old stuff will be 
</I>&gt;<i> dropped -- Twisted has an unfortunate history as such things go, but we 
</I>&gt;<i> are getting better about it.
</I>
Also agreed -- and I'm very happy to see Twisted continuing its
steady evolution, and now a mainstay among Python libraries.  Kinda
validates my original judgment that it would be -- thanks to the
whole Twisted community for that, especially Glyph and the core
minions (you know who you are :).

Cheers,
Steve
