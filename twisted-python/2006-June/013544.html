I ran into similar problems at work where we had been using PB but found 
that it did not perform to expectation (or requirement).

I've replaced the bulk of our PB communications with a STOMP[1] protocol 
implementation to talk to with ActiveMQ[2] servers.  This has been great 
and I can easily push over 10000 messages/second now.

And by switching over to ActiveMQ, we got a lot of other interesting 
features (much like what Spread might provide I guess), like topics 
(many to many communication rather than point to point), and their 
reliability and persistence features.

I did have to write my own STOMP protocol implementation as the existing 
one for Python is not up to snuff.  I may be able to release it back to 
the ActiveMQ people, but I'm not entirely sure yet.

And sure .. it meant installing Java.  But it also meant having 
something that worked well, performed beautifully, and gave me new 
features that are letting me re-architect our software to greatly 
simplify it and make it more reliable.
