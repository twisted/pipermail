<PRE>I would know how to do it in C, but I am no twisted expert. The idea
would be to open the socket and hand it off to the service to use. I am
sure there is a way to do it in Twisted (opening a port and using it in
a service).

What you don't want to do is just &quot;test&quot; the port (opening it and
closing it). Once you have it opened, you need to keep it open.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Chaz. Thank you for your reply. The reason for the test is that I

</I>&gt;<i> found to run the main service. I was thinking of writing a simple tester
</I>&gt;<i> using socket module to determine which addresses are alive first. When
</I>&gt;<i> it finds one it stops so in my logic I give this address to my
</I>&gt;<i> ListenTCP/SSL and attempt to start the main service.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't expect the address list to be large. This way no time is lost
</I>&gt;<i> with the client running through a long backoff cycle on an address that
</I>&gt;<i> may not be alive only to have to stop it and try a another until one is
</I>&gt;<i> possibly found.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not aware of something in twisted that evaluates addresses like
</I>&gt;<i> this as part of a startup solution. In any case, if I see that an
</I>&gt;<i> address in the list is available, then I would start my main service
</I>&gt;<i> using it.  When a connection is made to the main address, then I want to
</I>&gt;<i> start the remaining services since they are useless without the main
</I>&gt;<i> service.
