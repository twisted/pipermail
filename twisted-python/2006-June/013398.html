Have you submitted those as patches in the bugtracker?  If so, are we being really sluggish about applying them? :)

As you have unfortunately noticed with this change... we don't currently provide any support for configurations like this.  I'd personally like to discourage it, because long-term local modifications to Twisted indicate a failure of process, either you submitting them or us accepting them.

&gt;<i>But with the tagging changes with 2.4.0 (and without a tag for the
</I>&gt;<i>overall trunk), I was wondering if there were suggestions on how to
</I>&gt;<i>adjust our setup.
</I>
&gt;<i>I can understand why there is no single tag for the trunk, since an overall
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Sumo&quot; release of twisted
</I>
To reduce confusion we're trying to remove the word &quot;sumo&quot; everywhere.  If you spot that word still being used somewhere on the site it's a bug, please let us know.

Right now it's just &quot;a release of Twisted&quot;.

&gt;<i>So how (at the subversion tag level) if at all can I isolate those
</I>&gt;<i>files from beneath the twisted-web-0.6.0 tag that only apply to
</I>&gt;<i>twisted-web, so that I can add them to the files from
</I>&gt;<i>twisted-core-2.4.0 to yield my simulated vendor dump?
</I>
You can't, really.  Hopefully the internal repository structure of Twisted will one day look more like this:

    <A HREF="http://divmod.org/trac/browser/trunk">http://divmod.org/trac/browser/trunk</A>

and the tags will refer to project directories, like this:

    <A HREF="http://divmod.org/trac/browser/tags/releases">http://divmod.org/trac/browser/tags/releases</A>

but until that happens, the setup.py files for separate projects determine a fairly arbitrary collection of files.  Specifically, ownership of twisted/plugins/ is spread out between all subprojects.  Also, some files are moved around; the &quot;topfiles&quot; directory is pulled out to the root of each subproject as part of the release process.

&gt;<i>Is anyone else tracking the repository (but not instant to instant at
</I>&gt;<i>the trunk, but rather at release points) and if so, how are you doing
</I>&gt;<i>it post 2.4.0?
</I>
Divmod doesn't track Twisted releases through SVN; any changes we are in the process of contributing but which haven't been released are kept in our utility package &quot;Epsilon&quot;.  Epsilon has a &quot;hotfixes&quot; module which allows us to modify Twisted's behavior in cases where we really need to modify the library rather than just package additional functionality outside it -- you might look at that implementation as an example of a way to formalize monkeypatching and reduce its fragility.
