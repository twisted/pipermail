<PRE>Hi Chaz. Yes, passing the connection from a test that iterates through 
addresses would be the best solution. I still have authentication that 
is handled by twisted upon connection but the first priority is finding 
something is on the other end so I've got a viable service. If there is 
a way to do something like this directly in twisted I'm hoping for some 
direction. Many thanks.

Regards,
David

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Chaz. Thank you for your reply. The reason for the test is that I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using socket module to determine which addresses are alive first. When
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it finds one it stops so in my logic I give this address to my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ListenTCP/SSL and attempt to start the main service.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't expect the address list to be large. This way no time is lost
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the client running through a long backoff cycle on an address that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may not be alive only to have to stop it and try a another until one is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possibly found.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am not aware of something in twisted that evaluates addresses like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this as part of a startup solution. In any case, if I see that an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> address in the list is available, then I would start my main service
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using it.  When a connection is made to the main address, then I want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start the remaining services since they are useless without the main
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> service.
