&gt;<i>I'd just like to throw out an idea after working with Twisted  (especially

</I>&gt;<i>I love object databases... I've been using ZODB because it's so  simple to

</I>&gt;<i>saved in a file (or database, never tried it  though)...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyhow, I've started writing my Twisted application, where clients  contact 
</I>&gt;<i>a server to get objects, edit their details, and send them  back. Because 
</I>&gt;<i>ZODB works by maintaining references to other objects,  I can't just replace 
</I>&gt;<i>them with the new Copyables  when they come back  because they are different 
</I>&gt;<i>instances. So, I compare the _p_oid  attribute (object ID) with my original 
</I>&gt;<i>objects to locate the one I'm  looking for, copy the __dict__ across from 
</I>&gt;<i>the Copyable to the  original object, and commit the transaction. I haven't 
</I>&gt;<i>gotten much  further than that, but I'm sure I'll have problems with objects 
</I>&gt;<i>which  refer to other objects etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What's great about Referenceables is that Twisted gives you the  original 
</I>&gt;<i>instance when they come back to you, but the client can't  access the 
</I>&gt;<i>attributes or run any of it's methods locally. What's  great about Copyables 
</I>&gt;<i>is that the whole instance is sent down the  wire and the client can alter 
</I>&gt;<i>it's attributes, call it's methods, and  send it back...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Back to the ZODB... what would be extremely useful is if clients  could get 
</I>&gt;<i>an objects from the ZODB sent down to them, edit the  attributes and call 
</I>&gt;<i>the methods, and sent it back and *have it be the  original instance again*. 
</I>&gt;<i>Sort of like the best of both words of  Referenceables and Copyables. Of 
</I>&gt;<i>course, this doesn't have to have  anything to do with the ZODB, it was just 
</I>&gt;<i>my motivation for this  idea. Any object could be sent down the wire, 
</I>&gt;<i>edited, and sent back  having the original instance updated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My questions are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1) Is there any way to achieve this using Twisted the way things are?
</I>
It's possible for applications or libraries which use Twisted but aren't
part of Twisted to define new kinds of behavior for PB objects.  You can
define a class which combines the features of Referenceable and Copyable
if you like.

You can find some code which does something somewhat along these lines in
twisted/words/service.py: for example, the PBGroup and PBGroupReference
classes cooperate to make a type which, on the remote side, ends up with
Python methods which make remote PB method calls as well as a single
data attributes copied from the server (the attributes are effectively
read-only, though - you cannot modify them and send the instance back to
the server).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2) Is my copying-across-the-dict a good enough solution, and I should  just 
</I>&gt;<i>forget about the whole thing?
</I>
If the possibility for multiple clients to interact with the same objects
simultaneously exists, you will need some kind of conflict resolution.
This is one reason Twisted doesn't include a class like this - different
applications often want different conflict resolution behavior.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>3) I hear Zope 3 contains some kind of Twisted integration. For the  life of 
</I>&gt;<i>me I can't find any information about this on the web, and I  even bought a 
</I>&gt;<i>book on Zope 3 recently and the only reference to  Twisted is that you can 
</I>&gt;<i>use Twisted Web instead of Zope's ZServer to  service web requests.
</I>
The integration is by way of WSGI.  While this means that Zope3 code may
be running in the same process as a Twisted reactor, you have to go a bit
out of your way to get any benefit from this.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>4) I've been toying with Divmod Axiom, and I see there is Twisted  Persisted 
</I>&gt;<i>(but can't find much info on it), plus there is Twisted  Enterprise, but 
</I>&gt;<i>that is too close to relational databases for my  liking. Do any of these 
</I>&gt;<i>projects have integration like this?
</I>
None of them do.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>5) Does anyone else think this is a cool idea and like to see it 
</I>&gt;<i>implemented?
</I>
It might be interesting.  I can't see any use-cases for which it is head
and shoulders above a solution with looser PB coupling, but that doesn't
mean one doesn't exist. :)
