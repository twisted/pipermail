</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, it's something I've only be toying with. I can handle all the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - handling lost connections gracefully

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - massive code cleanups
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would very much support you continuing development on Orbited.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, I believe I can help, or already have patches for most of the

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://github.com/clemesha/hotdot">http://github.com/clemesha/hotdot</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically, see here for Orbited and twistd working together:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and see the below for patches that improve handling lost connections gracefully:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://gist.github.com/256582">http://gist.github.com/256582</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, it would be awesome if you put up your improvements on Github
</I>&gt;<i> (just a suggestion :-),
</I>&gt;<i> then I can easily fork and starting adding improvements, and you can
</I>&gt;<i> pull and we can move this forward.
</I>
I had worked with your hotdot stuff a while ago, and I think I had even sent you some django csrf patches for Django 1.2 compatibility (it was a while ago...)

Back then, I had started on refactoring the one-big-javascript file in Orbited a few months ago but, at the time, was assured that 0.8 was &quot;just around the corner&quot;, so I left it alone.

Well...now I have need and, since Athena seems to be tightly tied to Nevow, cometd is itself, websocket is websocket, so I'm looking again.   Since Orbited seems to have gone into &quot;unmaintained mode&quot;, I agree, it may just be time for a fork.

&gt;<i> p.s. I haven't found many issues with the frontend JavaScript code, but if you
</I>&gt;<i> have specific issues that you could point out, I'd love to try to help.
</I>
Mostly the problems I had with it were the lack of doc, and the all-in-one 2700 line .js file, and the complete lack of unit tests of any type.

&gt;&gt;<i> The only problem is that I'm not that knowledgeable about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Javascript browser hacks they've employed - their Orbited.js is more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than half &quot;magic&quot; to me (probably due to me not having an opportunity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to work on a large js project). It's something that I'd like to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into, if someone is willing to take the lead on the javascript side.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It could potentially be as simple as slotting in js.io
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://github.com/mcarter/js.io">http://github.com/mcarter/js.io</A>), which Orbited.js has apparently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> become, and which appears to have been the plan for Orbited 0.8.
</I>
The js.io site documentation link says &quot;Sorry, we don't have documentation yet&quot;, and the doc directory on github has a powerpoint file and an echo server so I'm not sure that's going to help so much.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> They all seem to have gone off to play with node.js instead.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't *really* blame them, considering most of the project's merit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lay in the Javascript realm, and node.js is basically a (less
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> featurful) version of Twisted for Javascript (of course with the added
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bonus of using a heavily JITed and optimized Javascript VM).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Very cool, I hadn't seen that before.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, very neat. Haven't done much with it, but I think it's a real
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> winner when you're doing something simple like long-polling/
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> broadcasting from a queue.
</I>
Well, if there's interest on reviving Orbited either as itself, or as a new project with some code from Orbited as well as some of Alex's stuff, I'm in.
