</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Jean!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have written an introductory article to Twisted, and I would be
</I>&gt;<i> delighted to see it published on Linux Weekly News some day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is available at: <A HREF="http://jdb.github.com/concurrent.html">http://jdb.github.com/concurrent.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wow. &#160;This is an incredible, sprawling article :).
</I>&gt;<i> I'm glad you wrote it, and I think it introduces quite a bit of material.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really have time to write up a full editorial review, but definitely
</I>&gt;<i> the strongest impression I got from reading it was this comment which you
</I>&gt;<i> already made:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - it might be too long and present too many things, maybe I should&#160;split it
</I>&gt;<i> in parts,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is really a series of articles; you should expand on each part, one at
</I>&gt;<i> a time. &#160;It really seems like you're rushing through it in order to cover a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of ground.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Someone who is deeply committed to learning about Twisted and is planning to
</I>&gt;<i> spend quite a while reading it would be well-served by your introduction.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;However, most people who come to Twisted are actively trying to get
</I>&gt;<i> something done, and they don't care about the theory too much until they
</I>&gt;<i> manage to get some basic stuff working. &#160;So you may want to provide some
</I>&gt;<i> more pointers to tutorials and other practical getting-started guides.
</I>&gt;<i> You also focus a bit too much on performance. &#160;While a Twisted server does
</I>&gt;<i> provide some performance benefits, it's very hard to conclusively measure
</I>&gt;<i> that one approach is really &quot;faster&quot; than the other; especially since some
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted idioms (such as the inlineCallbacks example at the bottom of your
</I>&gt;<i> article) are just as &quot;slow&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> There are lots of benchmarks showing various different performance
</I>&gt;<i> characteristics of multithreaded vs. multiprocess vs. event-driven code, and
</I>&gt;<i> with modern optimizations in each of these architectures, which of these is
</I>&gt;<i> really the fastest changes from year to year. &#160;If you were to take some
</I>&gt;<i> benchmarks of Twisted vs. code using the 'multiprocessing' module, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, you might get some surprising results (and ones which would vary
</I>&gt;<i> wildly depending on which platform you were using and what exact algorithms
</I>&gt;<i> you used in each example).
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to focus on performance, you should include benchmarks and
</I>&gt;<i> measurements which back up your claims. &#160;Personally,&#160;I'd focus more on the
</I>&gt;<i> safety and comprehensibility discussion. &#160;Even in the realm of performance,
</I>&gt;<i> the issue isn't that Twisted is really *faster*, per se, it's that the
</I>&gt;<i> structure of the code is easy to understand and modify, and therefore easier
</I>&gt;<i> to optimize when you know what your bottlenecks really are. &#160;My favorite
</I>&gt;<i> example of this is &quot;try to write a failing unit test for a race condition in
</I>&gt;<i> multithreaded code&quot;. &#160;In most Twisted applications, you can force the order
</I>&gt;<i> of execution in your test so that you can verify the race going one way,
</I>&gt;<i> then the other, but with threads it's very, very tricky (and sometimes not
</I>&gt;<i> really feasible, or even possible).
