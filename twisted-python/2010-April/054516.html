Yeah, I don't think it's much of an issue.

It does do it on import, and then later as a fallback if that
import-time check found “broken versions of linux” where “write-only
pipe are detected as readable.”  This is apparently Linux &lt; 2.6.11.

I suppose if someone does find it's an issue for them that it wouldn't
be too hard to fix, although perhaps they'd find it easier to simply
upgrade their OS...
