Thanks for the encouragement, Tim.   I've shied away from reviews as the first couple of tickets I tried to pick up, that were relevant to the things I *use* every day, were so far over my head (Twisted-wise) that I just kind of gave up.  

It was very strange to know and have used all of the concepts in the tickets, but have absolutely no idea what to *do* about it vis a vis the Twisted tickets in question.  It was kind of like knowing all the nouns in a language but no verbs.

I'll see if I can find some of the &quot;easy&quot; ones that are in some way related to my actual work and get started again...

Thanks,

Steve
