</I>&gt;<i> I want some experience with Sphinx so that can verify the premise that

</I>&gt;<i> is a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh.  I am definitely taking that as a given.  Or rather: having frequently
</I>&gt;<i> interacted with the output of both sphinx and lore, I was already confident
</I>&gt;<i> that it was better than Lore in most ways before we began this conversation.
</I>&gt;<i>  I had a few specific misgivings, which Kevin has since addressed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sphinx clearly has the *features* that we need; Kevin's analysis looks
</I>&gt;<i> pretty thorough, and even the current error-laden converted documentation
</I>&gt;<i> serves as a reasonable proof of concept.  Plus, the plan specifically
</I>&gt;<i> includes resolving the remaining issues with that documentation as a
</I>&gt;<i> prerequisite to getting it merged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So while I could believe that there will be bad things about Sphinx which
</I>&gt;<i> may surprise me, I find it hard to believe that I could be surprised by any
</I>&gt;<i> bug in Sphinx so awful that it would be *enough worse* than Lore to make
</I>&gt;<i> continuing to maintain Lore a preferable option, given the presence of a
</I>&gt;<i> documentation maintainer willing to do the drudgework of conversion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, it might be a good idea to do the Divmod project conversions
</I>&gt;<i> first for other reasons.  They have less documentation, so there's less to
</I>&gt;<i> review, and the process could be completed more quickly, letting us get some
</I>&gt;<i> benefit out of the process earlier on.  Since these projects are the only
</I>&gt;<i> known remaining users of lore, we could get rid of lore immediately when
</I>&gt;<i> twisted itself is converted, rather than letting it linger until its users
</I>&gt;<i> have converted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think maybe I'll try to do a quickie conversion on one of the Divmod
projects (probably Nevow)  in the next couple of days.  I'm not planning on
doing a theme or anything yet...just the content conversion, followed by
manual cleanup.
