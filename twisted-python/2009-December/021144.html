I can certainly understand (and sympathize with) this point of view, but...

Not quite.  You brought it up right here:

&gt;<i> IMHO from the practical point of view the only case when separation of Deferreds would benefit Twisted community as a whole would be inclusion of it into the standard library,
</I>&gt;<i> but this is not going to happen soon ...
</I>
If nobody ever takes Deferred and puts it outside of Twisted, then this will happen &quot;never&quot; instead of &quot;not soon&quot;.  Eventually, somebody does need to bite the bullet and clean up Deferred for submission into the standard library.  The work that jml is doing here will help that, and so it's a worthwhile goal, even if it eventually brings some pain along with it.

When Deferred is in the standard library, it will enable communication between code written for different asynchronous backends, which is not currently possible.
