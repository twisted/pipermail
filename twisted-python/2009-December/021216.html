I was referring to the Lefkowitz Definition of Real Life(tm):

Real life: N. That which interferes with the generation of nifty open-source
code.

Well, I've got the code (and proposal) in an SVN repos, but it's not public,
and I can't really make it so (long story). I've got an item on my TODO list
to extract it from there and put it up someplace else, but I haven't gotten
to it yet...

In the meantime, I can post a diff of the proposal if you like, or a part of
my SVN log, but you really haven't missed anything significant on the
proposal, I'm afraid.  Mostly just a minor cleanup.
