</I>
In general, it looks pretty good! I do have some comments, though:

 - Occasionally when you use a docstring, the indenting is
   inconsistent, like this:

     &quot;&quot;&quot;
    docstring goes here
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

   Obviously it still works, but you'll be asked to fix it if you ever
   contribute code to pretty much any open-source project, so you might
   as well get in the habit now.

 - You import twisted.internet.reactor in main() and in ebConnection();
   you might as well just import it at the top of the file along with
   all the other imports.

 - The reason people put code in a main() function rather than just
   putting it at the end after 'if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:' is so that
   they can write tests for it, or otherwise call it from other code.
   However, because you call reactor.run() from your main() function,
   it can't be called from other code - you might want to move the
   reactor.run() call to the bottom of the file.

 - In ebConnection() you set up logging to stdout, then log the error,
   then stop the reactor - but there are various other places where you
   log things with print statements. You might as well set up logging
   at the bottom of the file as well, then use &quot;log.msg()&quot; where you
   used to use &quot;print&quot;.

All pretty minor things, really - well done!
