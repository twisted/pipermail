As someone who went through the awesomely steep learning curve for (and 
still uses) Zope, I can sort-of understand that &quot;oh no zope&quot; moment, but 
on the other hand, having used Zope a lot, I finally realised it's kind 
of the Unix of web frameworks (&quot;those that don't understand Zope are 
doomed to reinvent it, poorly&quot;). My crufty old Zope 2 installation still 
does things no other web does without extensive configuration, patching 
or work on my part.

It's sad that what is actually a fine product is detested within the new 
generation of python coders because they couldn't take the time to learn 
it, and it's even sadder to imagine uptake of a small, self-contained 
and well-tested sub-package suffers because of its name.

This is one excellent argument for putting it into the standard library, 
which I guess isn't going to happen :o(

</I>
Yes, there do seem to be an awful lot of people who are basically too 
lazy to put actual work into getting their software environment 
functioning ;o)

In all seriousness though - people are either installing from source, or 
a package. If the former, they're going to have to &quot;python setup.py 
install&quot; at least once; one more time (on an easy-to-compile package 
with no dependencies of its own) is not compelling to me!

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> It occurs to me that recent discussions about splitting Deferreds off

</I>&gt;<i> it? I don't know, but it might be worth finding out.
</I>
I don't *think* a lot of code uses it, which is unfortunate and 
symptomatic (IMHO) of a certain level of immaturity within the Python 
community.

&lt;rant&gt;

&quot;&quot;&quot;Hey, do you know what we need? Another web framework, with its own 
template engine, ORM and plugin API! W00t! This'll show those Ruby+Rails 
folks!&quot;&quot;&quot;

Really? Show them what exactly?

&lt;/rant&gt;
