<PRE>Michel Pelletier proposes an interesting idea, of integrating Zope with
Apache 2.0.
That sounds like a really great idea with many upsides -- especially because
you could write all kinds of interesting Apache extensions in Python.
Has anyone written that idea up, or discussed it on other mailing lists?
As a first step, how about using SWIG to expose the Apache 2.0 api to
mod_python.

    -Don

Subject: [Zope-dev] A modest proposal: Replace medusa with Twisted

Just to throw out another idea, Amos has discussed with me in the past the
idea of replacing medusa with Apache 2.0.  Compelling as many of Twisted's
features may be, Apache 2.0 as far as i can tell supports many of them as
well (except perhaps jython integration, which is a pipe dream anyway for
Zope).  Apache has the upshot in that it is rock solid, tested by millions,
trusted by even more, and no doubt one of the most actively developed peices
of software there is.

For ZC the upshots of 1) not needing to maintain it, and 2) it being a
excellent marketing tool outweight many technical benifits that twisted may
have that Apache doesn't (I'd like to know what the differences are,
however).  For example, does twisted do URL rewriting?  proxy?
process/thread job control?

Twisted does have the advantage of 1, but not 2.  Further, our faith in the
continuing development of Apache is, de facto, more than that of twisted
simply based on the age, number of users, and number of developers of each
project.

I'm not dismissing the idea, I'm just pointing out an alternative to
Itamar's alternative.  ;)

-Michel
