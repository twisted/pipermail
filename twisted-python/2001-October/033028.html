<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Rename everything in bin\ to include &quot;.py&quot; at the end.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does this break anything in particular for the Unix folks?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I realize it does make it a little more annoying, but can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you live with that to get it working under Windows?
</I>&gt;<i> Well, see, the twistd binary in there is mainly oriented towards unix
</I>&gt;<i> (it will try to daemonize, unless there's a '-n' option, etc.), and
</I>&gt;<i> really what is needed is decent infrastructure for running under
</I>&gt;<i> Windows. That means a .exe generated from distutils, and an NT service,
</I>&gt;<i> and as Juergen said autogenerated binaries.
</I>
That would all be nice.  Is anyone working on it?

&gt;<i> Given all that, it does run, last I checked
</I>
I'm still having problems with mktap, but they seem to be more
problems with my Python setup than with mktap itself...
Oh, wait, there it goes...

&gt;<i> (I did an app.run(0) instead of running my daemon with twistd).
</I>
I'm going to write up how I got working what I got working, and post it
to the list...  Later, after I've got more than just the web server
running.  Which probably means tomorrow, since now it's Wolfenstein time. ;)

&gt;<i> Except there was that wierd bug where
</I>&gt;<i> telnetting from linux to a windows telnet server crashed twisted (I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not kidding)...
</I>

Ugh.  I don't think I could even test for that.

As for the other bug, are you going to check in a fix?  I agree that a
call to rstrip() in the _encode method is the &quot;Right Thing (tm)&quot;.

Later,
Blake.
