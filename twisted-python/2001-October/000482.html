Well, your timing is interesting. I just got a phone call last night from
Glyph, and we talked a bit about how the new spatial simulation system is
_not_ to be developed inside twisted.reality, but as a separate package.
Twisted.reality still does need a lot of work, and glyph pointed out a few
things to me that need done:

1) Re-do the broadcasting system. It's kind of a mess now. I've taken a
_look_ at this, but I'm not really sure where to take it. IIRC you were 
the
guy who was interested in this before, so if you could do a little work in
this area it'd be great.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Yes, that is me. I did have some code ready for 0.10.2 (or whatever was 
current two weeks ago). As soon as I get some time I will see how this 
fits in with 0.11.0. I suspect any changes would be minimal, though I will 
need to change TRDemo and Inheritance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
2) Get rid of the 'reality' reference inside things. Glyph says this would
apparently reduce memory footprint by a huge amount. I think I'll analyze
exactly how much work getting rid of this is going to mean. Obviously it's
not just a simple &quot;ok, delete all code using thing.reality&quot; -- it's a big
structural change (Realities should reference things, and not the other 
way
around)

3) Get rid of the global object dicts. This would probably be a lot of 
work
as a lot of code would get touched by this. As glyph has preached before,
&quot;Twisted represents a huge directional graph&quot; -- things can get references
to each other any number of ways, without a global thing store.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

I have not looked into these two points much. I will look at them when I 
get some time, after I have made my changes for the broadcast system.

Ehh, that last paragraph was pretty much a braindump. But I am kinda tired
of being completely clueless about how all this stuff is gonna fit 
together.

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Like I said, whatever time I can get to work on Twisted I will be happy to 
give.

Cheers,
ChrisH
