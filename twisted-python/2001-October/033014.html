</I>&gt;<i> 	BTW, I read that you want to use RPC over unix domain sockets
</I>&gt;<i> 	- the Twisted project has a generic secure remote object
</I>&gt;<i> 	publishing system called PB. It runs over sockets, SSL, unix

</I>&gt;<i> 	implement programs without having to design a protocol from

</I>&gt;<i> 	wonderful platform for server developement:
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="http://www.twistedmatrix.com.">http://www.twistedmatrix.com.</A> And that way maybe someday it
</I>&gt;<i> 	can work with other stuff as well (e.g. Java).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll take a look at it but I don't think it's the right thing for the
</I>&gt;<i> crypto library, at least without some kind of user authentication that
</I>&gt;<i> I currently haven't implemented.  Even with authentication I'd be
</I>&gt;<i> uncomfortable exposing the server directly to an IP network.  My idea
</I>&gt;<i> is to connect the server to the application host over a point to point
</I>&gt;<i> connection like a serial port.
</I>
Why do you have to expose the server to an IP network? like itamar said, you
can use regular sockets, SSL, *or* unix domain sockets. And serial ports can
speak TCP/IP with SLIP. I'm not sure how hard it would be to do a native
serial port interface in twisted..

&gt;<i> Does PB have some advantage over running a standard non-encrypted RPC
</I>&gt;<i> protocol over SSL?
</I>
Yes, it's really cool RPC. :-)

&gt;<i> 	And philosophically I think you'd like it. For example, the
</I>&gt;<i> 	way it implements home directories for users in a web
</I>&gt;<i> 	server. Each user runs their own webserver, and then the main
</I>&gt;<i> 	one that listens on port 80 forwards request to ~itamar/ to my
</I>&gt;<i> 	personal web server (using PB). So each user has their CGIs,
</I>&gt;<i> 	server scripts and so on, run using their own permissions and
</I>&gt;<i> 	limits.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why not just use an apache proxy server on port 80, proxying requests
</I>&gt;<i> to user servers?
</I>
1) We want to use twisted.web
2) we want to use PB
3) python is more secure than C :-)

&gt;<i> 	And I'm a developer on it (though I wasn't at all involved with these
</I>&gt;<i> 	parts of the code), so I'm sure my bias shows :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I did look at twistedmatrix a few days ago and it looked kind of
</I>&gt;<i> interesting.  I didn't notice any of the security/crypto stuff at the
</I>&gt;<i> time.
</I>
well admittedly all we have for security/crypto is SSL. (right?)

Anyway, I know these answers aren't the best, someone else will give good
ones :)
