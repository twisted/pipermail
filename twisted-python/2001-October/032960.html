<PRE>What's the &quot;if&quot; clause in the features loop of BreadStick.sendMessage()
supposed to be doing?  

Why is the feature's method named &quot;do&quot; instead of &quot;sendMessage&quot;?  What's
the difference between features and SaltGrains?

What's the difference between a SaltGrain (or feature) and a
pb^H^Hpassport.Service?  May saltGrain.network be the same as
service.serviceName?  May person be a passport.Identity?

Must message be a string?


See...  Pretzel puzzles me.  This project has some ideas with great
potential, and it's precisely the sort of thing Twisted is good at...
so I don't get why you seem to be intent on re-implementing Twisted
inside of Twisted.  I guess that would make Pretzel live up to its name,
but...

This is why I kept asking what features pretzel was going to have,
because that's where I thought the fun was going to be.  If you had an
factoid-service, for example, which could be accessed through both IRC
and the web, that could be cool.  And there are definately some
protocol/interface-specific gaps to fill in before that will work. i.e.
msg'ing &quot;Hi&quot; to a Twisted IRC client doesn't currently set up any
sort of broker/viewpoint for you, so that'd be an excellent area for
&#252;berbot code to cover...

But establishing local services (SaltGrains) and passing messages
between them...  That's what Twisted *does*, no need to create more
infastructure there.

Am I missing something?  I may just be speaking up too soon on a subject
I know nothing about, but hey, that's what you get for checking it in to
CVS.  ;)

&quot;No, you're not going to trick me into writing IRC code *again*&quot;-ly,
