</I>&gt;&gt;<i>JP, what's the current state of the &quot;insults&quot; module you wrote? &#160;I'm

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>projects, and I didn't want to reinvent the wheel if it had already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>been done, so some diligent searching turned up the &quot;insults&quot; module
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>you wrote.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>There's almost no examples, and the API documentation seems to consist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of only method names (which are all very reasonably named), but not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>much in the way of actual descriptions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did you find
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk/doc/conch/examples/">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk/doc/conch/examples/</A>&gt;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll agree that there's little documentation, but I think the handful of
</I>&gt;<i> examples is pretty good, as examples go.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Is this a stable, portable module that I can expect to work on OS X
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and Linux, or is it a buggy work-in-progress (or something in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>between)? &#160;Searching the list archives turned up almost no discussion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>about it since 2007.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're wondering about the API stability (ie, the backwards
</I>&gt;<i> compatibility promises), they're the same as for the rest of Twisted.
</I>&gt;<i> Things won't change out from under you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as working reliably on multiple platforms, I think it does
</I>&gt;<i> *pretty* well, but I know it has some bugs to be worked out, and the
</I>&gt;<i> sheer number of terminal emulators out there (with their unique set of
</I>&gt;<i> bugs) means that there are probably a lot of configurations in which it
</I>&gt;<i> is sub-par. &#160;I'd consider most such cases bugs to be fixed in insults,
</I>&gt;<i> but someone still needs to fix them for that to help you. ;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The biggest benefits I see with ncurses are that it's got tons of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>documentation and I know it will work wherever Python works.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The benefits I see with insults is that it is designed to work with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Twisted and seems to have a decent selection of widgets, so I wouldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>have to implement too many basic widgets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a couple back-burner projects in which I'm using insults, and I
</I>&gt;<i> don't see changing to anything else. &#160;However, if you'd like another
</I>&gt;<i> option to consider, there's Urwid (and it supports Twisted, too).
</I>
Okay, so it sounds like I need to sit down and do a side-by-side
comparison between curses, insults, and urwid before I can make an
intelligent decision.

Why do terminal frameworks have such wacky names?  Sheesh...
