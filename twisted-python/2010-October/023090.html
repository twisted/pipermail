<PRE>Hello Jean-Paul, thanks for tracking this down, you rock!

I promise that when I'll have payed all by debts I'll buy one of
those posters of Exarkun to hang on my wall!

</I>&gt;<i>  OneA has a producer of OneE
</I>&gt;<i>  OneA has a consumer of OneB
</I>&gt;<i>  At some point OneB gives up and tells OneA to stopProducing (loseConnection)
</I>&gt;<i>  OneA.loseConnection stops the reactor from reading OneA and starts it writing
</I>&gt;<i>  OneA.doWrite happens
</I>&gt;<i>    it finds the send buffer empty
</I>&gt;<i>    it finds a registered producer (OneE) and resumes it
</I>&gt;<i>  OneE never produces any more bytes
</I>&gt;<i>  OneE loses its connection at some point and unregisters itself from OneA
</I>&gt;<i>  OneA takes note that it has no more producer, but does nothing about it
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the bug is likely that FileDescriptor.unregisterProducer doesn't do anything special when disconnecting=True.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You should be able to reproduce this very simply by setting up a transport-producer/consumer pair, calling loseConnection on the transport, then unregistering the producer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This all sounds somewhat familiar, but I don't see an existing ticket for it, so maybe that's my imagination.

Following your indications I attached a minimal example to a new ticket:

<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4719">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4719</A>

Some additional info:

* problem occurs only if more than 64KB of data are written to the
transport before its consumer calls stopProducing on it

* problem occurs only if some time passes before its producer
unregisters itself from the transport

Thanks again for your help! :)
