<PRE>Hi!


People following the IRC channel have probably heard about the t-shirt I'm
trying to get printed. The idea isn't mine (it belongs to Mike Graham, aka
papna), but he told me it's okay if I try to make a shirt out of it. Here's
a proposal shirt: it's not *really* the idea that you buy this yet (but
you're free to, of course) -- mostly so other people can see how it looks on
a shirt.

The shirt is intended as a parody of the Gadsen flag (
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsden_flag">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsden_flag</A>). Hence the bright yellow color
and lack of apostrophe in &quot;dont&quot;.

Feedback is welcome: do you think the layout or relative sizes should be
changed? Is the apostrophe being missing okay? Is the font OK? It's
currently Cardo, because Cardo is pretty and it's a serif font from the
correct period. papna has raised the concern that the fine lines may not
screenprint well, and I should use a more humanist typeface. People with
Zazzle experience welcome to chime in there.

cheers
