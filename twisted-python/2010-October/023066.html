I'm not American at all, and I think it's hilarious.

&gt;<i> About the apostrophe: yes, the reason it is currently missing is because it
</I>&gt;<i> is missing on the Gadsen flag. That's also the reason the t-shirt is yellow.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm getting mixed feedback on how important mimicing the Gadsen flag is, in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of:
</I>&gt;<i>  - typeface (this is Cardo 99 SIL. Printing on T-shirts occasionally has
</I>&gt;<i> problems with small, thin serifs on serif fonts.)
</I>
I notice that Wikipedia's &quot;Gadsden Flag&quot; page includes a scan from an
1885 school-book that includes a reproduction of said flag, and it
definitely uses a sans-serif typeface. Like most visual designs that
have been drawn and redrawn thousands of times by hundreds of people
over the centuries, I suspect a little variance is permissible.

&gt;<i>  - color (although I like it because it's a Python-related shirt, and yellow
</I>&gt;<i> isn't my favorite color)
</I>
The common ingredients of a Gadsden Flag reference seem to be &quot;yellow&quot;,
&quot;snake&quot; and the slogan; given how much the Twisted Matrix logo resembles
the traditional rattlesnake (i.e. not very much) keeping the colour and
the slogan close to the original seems important.

&gt;<i>  - apostrophe (authenticity vs correctness - fortunately it's just a lexer
</I>&gt;<i> problem in &quot;don't&quot; and not the far more expensive parser problems of
</I>&gt;<i> your/you're/there/their/they're)
</I>
I see somebody tried to add an apostrophe to the SVG version of the flag
on Wikipedia, which was quickly reverted (sadly without a rationale or
citation). A Google Image Search for &quot;DONT TREAD ON ME&quot; shows that both
with-apostrophe and without-apostrophe variants are common, but the ones
without seem more... authentic somehow.

Enough bike-shedding? :)
