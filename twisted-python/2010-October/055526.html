I can't recall having seen this exact issue in the past, but as you've described it it sounds like you may have discovered a Twisted bug.  I'm looking forward to your example.

I do have a few questions:

What version of Twisted are you using?
Have you tried a more recent version? Trunk?
What reactor are you using?
Have you tried a different reactor?
What platform/OS are you on?  What version?
Have you tried a different platform?

I am also curious whether changing

   proto.transport.loseConnection()

to
   reactor.callLater(0, proto.transport.loseConnection)

makes any difference to your example.

Thanks, and good luck,
