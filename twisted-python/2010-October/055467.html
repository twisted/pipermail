While I'm able to reproduce this, I can't really as it involves a 
customer ftp server also generating error messages and they've already 
had enough of them ;-)

</I>
Well, unfortunately I can't do any of the above :-( I've only seen this, 
as I said previously, when we use twisted.protocols.ftp.FTPClient to try 
to send a file to an ftp server that was only able to handle active ftp 
transfers when our setup only allowed passive ftp transfers.

It was happening in a steady, reproducible fashion (ie: every time we 
tried) but unfortunately we've had to bail and now send via sftp using a 
pexpect-based wrapper around the real sftp command client (we had buggy 
behaviour with twisted's sftp client elsewhere)

I hope this helps, do let me know if I should add it to an issue 
somewhere...

cheers,

Chris
