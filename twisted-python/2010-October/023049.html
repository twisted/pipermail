<PRE>Sorry about that.  I just started using twisted so I'll try to be more specific.

We have 2 different twisted plugins that uses shared code.   Each of these plugins is run as a  TCPClient on separate machines.

What would like to do is to somehow identify what twisted services/plugins are running because different things happen depending on what plugin is currently in use.  We are running on Linux wanted to see if there was an easy way of doing that using the twisted libraries.  I suppose one solution is to get a list of processes running and parse that but I would rather not do that.

Thanks.

Liz

Hi all,

I'm looking for a way to get a list of services and/or plugins that currently running on a machine.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to do that?

Thanks.

This question is a bit too vague to be answered with any confidence.  What do you mean by &quot;service&quot;?  What do you mean by &quot;plugin&quot;?  And what do you mean by &quot;running&quot;?  These things have generic meanings and then more specific jargon-y meanings with respect to Twisted.  Do you mean &quot;what twistd plugins are installed in my system Python&quot;, or &quot;what processes that use Twisted are currently running&quot;, or &quot;what Service objects are currently .running == True in my current process&quot;, or something else?
