Okay.  Then we're back to Glyph's idea, which is that there really is a 
bug to fix. :)
&gt;<i>Moreover, if it was just a problem of my code not unregistering the
</I>&gt;<i>producer then this wouldn't explain why registering the producer as
</I>&gt;<i>non-streaming fixes the issue. It also wouldn't explain why does
</I>&gt;<i>this happen only in particular conditions and not always (even if I
</I>&gt;<i>managed to reproduce it reliably, I still have to debug the exact
</I>&gt;<i>external conditions that trigger it).
</I>
Hopefully this will turn into a simple example which can reliably 
reproduce the problem for everyone. :)
&gt;<i>As a side note, for once what you wrote is not 200% exact ;) because
</I>&gt;<i>the connection is always closed properly if it's the peer closing it
</I>&gt;<i>first, even if the producer is still registered in that case. (Maybe
</I>&gt;<i>Twisted unregisters the producer by itself when this happens?)
</I>
Thanks for that clarification.

Jean-Paul
