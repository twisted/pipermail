</I>&gt;<i> This strikes me as a problem with the way that quantum physics works more than the way that

</I>&gt;<i> even if they did, relativity says you wouldn't be able to /tell/ if they happened at the exact 
</I>&gt;<i> same time unless they also happened to be exactly the same distance away from you.  (But then 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;you&quot; would have to be exactly one atom big, which is a pretty demanding size to build a sensor.)
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately however, the order of the work /will/ be arbitrary; if it's not influenced by the 
</I>&gt;<i> vagaries of Twisted's scheduler, it will be influenced by something in the kernel scheduler that 
</I>&gt;<i> you don't understand or can't control, or in the IP stack, or in a switch on your network, or in 
</I>&gt;<i> your hosting provider's firewall configuration, or something on a client machine that you truly 
</I>&gt;<i> have no influence over at all.  Having something give priority to an event that occurs at &quot;the 
</I>&gt;<i> same&quot; time given all of these potential sources of interference is basically pointless.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Isn't that  what logical clocks, using e.g. Lamport timestamps are for? What can be done is letting 
the events happen, wait for another logical tick, possibly triggered by a timeout to prevent 
starvation, looking at the events that have been collected and identified, but not processed yet, 
treating a certain maximum N of logical ticks as &quot;simultaneous&quot; and then decide on how to prioritize 
processing, based on arbitrary rules you choose.

Johann
