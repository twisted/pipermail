</I>&gt;<i> This will be the last sprint that Exarkun can join us for in Boston, though, so it's also your last chance to visit and bother him to review your tickets in person!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As with the last few sprints, we'll be at the Smarterer.com offices in South End Boston, from about 2:00 PM to 10:00 PM; If you're interested, please contact me to be added to the official invitation (which includes more specific info about how to get there, and gain access to the building, which is locked on weekends).
</I>
I'll be there, and I'll be working on at least 2 exciting and mysterious features :).

If you've gotten an evite, please respond to it so we have an accurate headcount!

If you haven't gotten one, but you'd like to come, please send a personal message to myself or Tenth.

Also, for this sprint or for future sprints, if you're not in the Boston metro area, we'd love to co-ordinate with events in other cities.  If you'd like to host something but you've never organized a sprint before, there are many people on this list who would be happy to help you figure that out :).
