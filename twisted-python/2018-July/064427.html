</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for driving this to completion, Tom!  Much appreciated.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This helps with both automatically closing the associated Trac ticket (I already did that in this case) and properly attributing credit for reviewer points on <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/.">https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I always forget the format and then I have to search previous commits or wiki.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We make reference to the Trac ticket in PR title, Branch Name, PR

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do we really need to make another reference in the merge commit?
</I>&gt;<i> For me, it's red tape.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that we should make things more complicated, just to

</I>
If we forget every so often, it's not a big deal, but I find it's nice to have a generally consistent merge format.  I do really wish that Github could do this in the same way that it does for a PR template so we didn't have to remember manually.

&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps we should avoid the &quot;cleared to land&quot; label on PRs from non-committers? I scan through open PRs for ones which require a procedural nudge now and again, but I had not looked at this one as the process appeared to be done with it, and I missed that it was from a non-committer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ideally it would be used sparingly, but, the availability of such a process release-valve allows someone to do a review even if they only have time to read the code, and not the time to sit around waiting 40 minutes for some intermittent CI nonsense to shake out.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since this doesn't have a <A HREF="https://twisted.reviews/">https://twisted.reviews/</A> -like &quot;core gameplay loop&quot; that project members regularly visit, perhaps if you're going to use this label you should always shoot a message to this list as well, to let other contributors know that they should take a look if they have a minute?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On that note, it looks like <A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1010">https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1010</A> has suffered the same fate?  Any other committers have a minute to land that one? :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1010">https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1010</A> was merged now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do we really need and up to date branch before a merge?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking that with the &quot;clear to land&quot; label, we can have a
</I>&gt;<i> robot which checks for the PR and once all tests are green, the robot
</I>&gt;<i> will automatically merge based on
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#merge-a-pull-request-merge-button">https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#merge-a-pull-request-merge-button</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#merge-a-pull-request-merge-button">https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#merge-a-pull-request-merge-button</A>&gt;
</I>
This sounds like a great idea, and is very close to what I would do if I had time for working on automation :).

Rather than using the &quot;clear to land&quot; label, however, I'd probably do this on the basis of a passing review from a project member being present, and a passing build.  (The &quot;clear to land&quot; convention predates Github native code reviews.)

&gt;<i> The robot can also auto-update with 'trunk/master' a PR with clear to land.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am happy to work at automation and improving the Twisted PR process.
</I>
I know you're not a huge fan of Trac either - it would be a nice touch if the robot here could also notice Github reviews and delete the 'review' keyword; this would keep our highscores and stats stuff working, but eliminate a manual step for reviewers :).

&gt;<i> For example, I have this PR <A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1011">https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1011</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It only touches  .circleci/config.yml .... why should we block or wait
</I>&gt;<i> for the merge/review of this PR due to random failures on Buildbot?
</I>
It looks like this is another case of  twisted.python.test.test_sendmsg.CModuleSendmsgTests.test_shortsend messing up our build results.

&gt;<i> BTW. Do we need to run the documentation tests on Buildbot?
</I>&gt;<i> There are some documentation tests on Circle-CI. Is that not enough ?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://circleci.com/gh/twisted/twisted/1215">https://circleci.com/gh/twisted/twisted/1215</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://circleci.com/gh/twisted/twisted/1215">https://circleci.com/gh/twisted/twisted/1215</A>&gt;
</I>
I don't think that this should be a required check on buildbot; we definitely shouldn't block on it, especially for bugfixes, but one of the advantages of the buildbot check as opposed to the CircleCI/Travis checks is that the Buildbot check uploads an artifact.  If you look at <A HREF="https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/documentation/builds/4071">https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/documentation/builds/4071</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/documentation/builds/4071">https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/documentation/builds/4071</A>&gt; for example, you can see that the .tar.bz2 files under the last 2 steps are downloadable, and you can crack them open to look at the index.html inside and see what the built docs actually look like.  Sadly we haven't had a lot of doc PRs lately, but I do use this occasionally.

If we can host built artifacts with Travis or Circle somehow then we could just get rid of this.
