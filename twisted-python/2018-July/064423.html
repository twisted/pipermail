Hi all,

Perhaps it was <A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/991?">https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/991?</A> It was
tagged &quot;cleared to land&quot;, but had build failures unrelated to the
changes. I merged forward, pushed to branch, kicked a failing build, and
got the green checkmark. It has been merged.
Perhaps we should avoid the &quot;cleared to land&quot; label on PRs from non-
committers? I scan through open PRs for ones which require a procedural
nudge now and again, but I had not looked at this one as the process
appeared to be done with it, and I missed that it was from a non-
committer.
Also, yes, welcome Wim!

---Tom
