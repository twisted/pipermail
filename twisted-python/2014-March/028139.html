Aiming low (insert sarcastic look here), here's the first few:

&gt;<i> Twisted has a third party project called txsockjs which works
</I>&gt;<i> excellently, both by itself and in the context of other (HTTP)
</I>&gt;<i> resources. sockjs is a protocol which is basically &quot;websockets, damnit&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> even when the consumer is a bad browser like IE6.
</I>
Thankfully, I only have to support sane browsers...

&gt;<i> Twisted comes with a threadpool-backed WSGI server. (When I say
</I>&gt;<i> threadpool-backed I mean that the WSGI requests are handled in threads;
</I>&gt;<i> the IO itself of course comes from the Twisted reactor).
</I>
Yeah, I remember that, and I remember liking it :-)

&gt;<i> I find twisted to be a great tool for writing protocol implementations.
</I>&gt;<i> I have written tools for querying all sorts of gnarly proprietary
</I>&gt;<i> protocols over all sorts of gnarly transports (packet radio; it's
</I>&gt;<i> totally a thing), and more recently for doing crazy things like
</I>&gt;<i> multiplexing stream transports over existing RPC protocols. (Like, you
</I>&gt;<i> see a local port come up, and that actually creates a virtual stream
</I>&gt;<i> connection over an existing RPC thing to some virtual server on the
</I>&gt;<i> other end of the wire: <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_jEIvugwes">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_jEIvugwes</A>).
</I>
Cool!

&gt;<i> Twisted has had so many people write so many protocols in it that also
</I>&gt;<i> the testing tools (MemoryReactor, StringTransport) are great. Especially
</I>&gt;<i> if you are writing something very close to a wire protocol you will
</I>&gt;<i> undoubtedly enjoy those amenities. There's also tons of composable
</I>&gt;<i> things for receiving delimited lines, nestrings, etc. It's hard to tell
</I>&gt;<i> what you will be looking for since I don't know details about your
</I>&gt;<i> protocol, but having written more than a few protocol implementations
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to wager a guess and say Twisted has it or a third party thing
</I>&gt;<i> for twisted has it.
</I>
Yep, certainly sounds good. I guess I have concerns about 
discoverability and making sure I'm picking the right things to use 
rather than re-implementing things when I don't need to.

What's the best way for me to find things I should be using? I guess my 
fallback position is to ask lots of clueless questions on this list and 
hope I don't annoy to many people, is that viable?

&gt;<i> Twisted, emphatically and without reservation, for all the above
</I>&gt;<i> reasons. It's stable. All the stuff you need has been tried and tested
</I>&gt;<i> extensively in production. It runs on PyPy, and usually a damn sight
</I>&gt;<i> faster than on CPython, too.
</I>
Didn't know about the PyPy thing, that will be interesting if I ever hit 
performance problems...

&gt;<i> A common criticism of Twisted is that it &quot;takes over&quot; your codebase. I
</I>&gt;<i> am speaking at PyCon in about a month to demonstrate that that isn't
</I>&gt;<i> true. (It just looks that way, because once people use it, they don't
</I>&gt;<i> want to go back... ;-))
</I>
Gutted I can't make it to PyCon this year, look forward to watching the 
video!

Chris
