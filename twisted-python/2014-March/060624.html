<PRE>The licenses are compatible and the maintainer is amenable to the idea though, so if you (and by &quot;you&quot; I mean Burak, not exarkun) wanted to start the work of merging in Ampoule, you could go right ahead.

I wish. I can’t even get Ampoule to work for myself. 

Besides, I’m probably lightyears away from enough skill to pass your code reviews, even if I understood exactly what Ampoule was doing. I did read the source code, but there is some really delicate meta–programming happening in that to allow bootstrapping an AMP connection over file descriptors. I do not understand operating systems and / or the Python interpreter enough to understand, much less program in such an environment. 

I do rely quite heavily on Ampoule, which is the reason I am deadlocked so hard at this point. I simply cannot allow GUI to slow down while the Twisted reactor is doing something else, because that GUI is also responsible for drawing 60fps CSS animations. My dependency is only going to get deeper as it seems. If I can fix and improve Ampoule as I go along, I might take up maintaining it, and then I would look into possibly getting it into Twisted. Meanwhile, if you have any insight as to why it fails so hard, please let me know. 

Best,
Burak

Considering the amount of maintenance Ampoule seems to have gotten over the last four years (~1 commit) I doubt you can count on someone else picking this up just because it would be great, though.

The one caveat I will give you is that Ampoule is probably not quite good enough as-is.  It's been a while, but I definitely remember discussing some of its deficiencies with people who had used it; you will probably get requests to change stuff in code review.  That's OK though, that's the whole point of code review.  This actually means that the fact that it's unmaintained is a good thing - not a lot of duplication of effort to improve it :).
