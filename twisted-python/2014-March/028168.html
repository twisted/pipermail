Right now there's the beginnings of a SwitchToBazaar which should probably be deleted, since we're not going to do that.

What's your username?  The only reason we even have edit permissions is to prevent spamming, anyone may ask for edit permission at any time :-).

&gt;<i> Compared to the SwitchToBazar page, here are the things which are
</I>&gt;<i> missing from your email - I don't know how relevant they are though:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * mailer post-commit hook
</I>
Yeah, we probably need this.  It seems like this ought to be pretty trivial to set up in git though :-).

&gt;<i> * the release scripts
</I>
Oh, good point.  These rely fairly lightly on svn, but the dependency is there.

This would be a good place to start.  Unfortunately, since tagging works differently in svn and git, I don't think we can simply start doing the release out of git without a repository to push to.  If I'm wrong about this, so much the better, and we could actually start having release managers use git if they like :).  Regardless, all the code to do so could be tested and landed as a normal development task with no administrative blockers, so this might be a good place for someone interested in moving the process along to start.

&gt;<i> * the developer documentation (I guess that should be done)
</I>
The developer documentation is already so bad (as Adi Roiban has pointed out) that it wouldn't make sense to block migrating to git on a comprehensive upgrade.

&gt;<i> * figure the version number from Git instead of Subversion
</I>
This would be an even more straightforward patch to Twisted, in twisted.python.versions.

&gt;<i> * decide what to do with Combinator
</I>
I think Combinator is an evolutionary dead end at this point.  Tools like virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper, pyenv, 

&gt;<i> There might be still some editing to do but that could be a start.

I've deleted the SwitchToBazaar page and, for now, uploaded your proposal at &lt;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Infrastructure/SwitchToGit">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Infrastructure/SwitchToGit</A>&gt;.  Hopefully someone (maybe me) can give you edit permission as soon as you announce your username :).

Thanks for your contribution,
