I wonder why you decided to use Ampoule to manage a single child process 
(that apparently shouldn't be restarted when it exits)?

I think Ampoule's purpose is to make it easy to run many processes and 
automatically restart them from time to time.

It sounds like the basic process support included in Twisted, 
reactor.spawnProcess, could address your requirements.
