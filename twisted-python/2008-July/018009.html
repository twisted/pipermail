Nathan&gt; Oh, ok.  My apologies, Terry.

Thanks - but no need!

Nathan&gt; After staring for awhile I think I figured out what's going on.
Nathan&gt; First, everywhere I use this method in real code is to provide a
Nathan&gt; final AMP response (which is why it works for me).  I think what
Nathan&gt; Jean Paul meant was that the AMP code looks at the object that the
Nathan&gt; AMP responder returns, and if that object is a deferred, then the
Nathan&gt; underlying AMP code (that you don't normally see) waits for the
Nathan&gt; deferred's callback value and uses that as the actual return value
Nathan&gt; of the AMP responder.

I've not looked at the code (maybe you should! :-)) but that sounds
right. And it would probably do this by just adding another callback to the
deferred.

Nathan&gt; I had mistakenly taken this as a more general method of
Nathan&gt; returned-deferreds-resolving-into-their-callback-values, which is
Nathan&gt; why everyone is taking issue with my hasty AMP-less pseudo-code.

That sounds right.

Nathan&gt; I must say, I've had more trouble grasping the nuances of deferreds
Nathan&gt; and other twisted objects than any other framework or language I've
Nathan&gt; ever worked with.  I also spend much more time _in vain_ going
Nathan&gt; through the docs and api reference than other languages.  At least
Nathan&gt; there's a great mailing list!

I know the feeling. I've found it helpful to read the various Deferred
pages quite a few times through, to play with toy examples to see the flow
of control, and also to read the source of defer.py (which isn't complex
and which I think is elegant).

Nathan&gt; So back to my original task -- I'm trying to get that same behaviour
Nathan&gt; in AMP when using a deferred list -- but I could probably just create
Nathan&gt; a deferred and return it as the AMP response (because AMP will wait
Nathan&gt; for the deferred's callback value), and then fire a callback with my
Nathan&gt; correct answer once I've processed my deferred list.  Thus, I could
Nathan&gt; avoid figuring out how AMP handles
Nathan&gt; deferred-lists-returned-from-responders altogether.

That sounds right too. It might help to know that a DeferredList is just a
subclass of Deferred. So when you return a DeferredList, you're in fact
returning something that behaves like a regular Deferred. When its callback
is fired, it gets a list of status &amp; results from all the deferreds in the
originally passed list. So if AMP knows how to handle deferreds, it can
certainly handle a DeferredList too.

Nathan&gt; Have I got it straight now?

Yep, sounds like it.

Terry
