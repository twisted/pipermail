If I understand your problem correctly (and I'm not sure that I do, so keep
that in mind), then what you probably want is something like a Twisted app
using two Protocol objects (perhaps in two different &quot;services&quot;), one to
talk to your clients, and one to talk to your API-generator-thingy (command
line).  Then you just need a way for these to communicate...someplace to
store the state.  A Queue.Queue is probably a good choice, but I'm not
entirely sure where you would put it.  Try looking around for examples that
have multiple services and see how they share state.  I think the Twisted
book might have something useful in this regard, though I don't have it with
me ATM.

Perhaps wiser heads than mine will have better ideas/comments.
