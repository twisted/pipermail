Don't.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     c = Client()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     d = c.GetBitInfo()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     d.addCallback(GotBitInfo)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     waitForDeferred(d)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     d = c.DoSomethingElse()
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, how do I waitForDeferred(), i.e. block until a Deferred fires?
</I>
You've asked a complicated question, to which I'm sure you'll get other 
answers. A very short answer is &quot;you don't, the reactor must not block&quot;. 
There are ways to achieve this, most of which make it *look* like the 
reactor blocked when it really didn't.

I had the same desire at one point, to make the code &quot;look&quot; simple so 
that others could use it. I have come to the conclusion that was a 
mistake; trying to hide the underlying async behaviour can actually be 
counter-productive.

You could use inlineCallbacks and python2.5 generators, which is a style 
I swing between really liking and worrying about:

from twisted.internet import defer

@defer.inlineCallbacks
def main():
     c = Client()

     # execution of the generator is paused here until the
     # deferred you've just yielded is callback'ed
     r = yield c.GetBitInfo()

     if r:
         # &quot;r&quot; now contains the value of the callback
         pass

     # optionally
     reactor.callLater(0.1, reactor.stop)

if __name__=='__main__':
     from twisted.internet import reactor
     reactor.addSystemEventTrigger('after', 'startup', main)
     reactor.run()

There are other approaches using Stackless, greenlets and running the 
reactor in a thread (shudder). For greenlets you might look at:
