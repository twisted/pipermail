Hey Andy, I never replied to your question.

We've been discussing several ways in which this would be done, and so
far none of them would require application developers to do anything
too radical. By definition, if you are moving to a new architecture,
something needs to be re-architected :-) One solution that we've
prototyped simply involves creating a small &quot;model&quot; object and passing
it to a new service. In that instance there is very little that a
developer would have to do. With support for things like
auto-discovery and messaging, even that step might (in many cases) go
away and you'd just have to instantiate a particular service.
