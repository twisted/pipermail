</I>&gt;<i> Hey Jono, sorry again that we didn't get the conversation online into irc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That's ok. Thanks for bringing it to the mailing list :)

&gt;<i> Here's a quick recap of what came out of the discussions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * The immediate goal is to settle on just enough of the core
</I>&gt;<i> interface to be certain it can be expanded in the directions which
</I>&gt;<i> will be needed in backwards compatible ways, so we can do a release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Good idea.

&gt;<i>  * open should explicit state the flags and permission it takes.  It
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't use posix constants.  At first we'll just support a small
</I>&gt;<i> subset that makes sense for all platforms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
+1

&gt;<i>  * createFile should be subsumed by open - the exclusive flag should
</I>&gt;<i> just be apart of open's flags.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Having a convenience method for creating a file seems like a good idea.

&gt;<i>  * The primitive interface for IO should be producer/consumers,
</I>&gt;<i> replacing readChunk, writeChunk.  This interface is primitive enough
</I>&gt;<i> to express all other interfaces, while still providing the opportunity
</I>&gt;<i> to optimize streaming performance.  The producer/consumer interface
</I>&gt;<i> will need to take an offset to allow readChunk and writeChunk to be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It would be nice to have things so that readChunks and writeChunks
(plural) could be implemented, to avoid potato programming.

&gt;<i>  * we're still postponing handling of symlinks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * we're still using getMetadata and setMetadata - its likely we want
</I>&gt;<i> a layer on top of using arbitrary key/value dicts for metadata, but
</I>&gt;<i> this can be introduced in a backwards compatible way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This reminds me, it would be good for VFS to have an exception for
&quot;this operation isn't supported&quot; (say with symlinks on fat32) and
another exception for &quot;supportable, but not actually implemented yet&quot;.

&gt;<i>  * we still need to decide whether path resolution should be moved to
</I>&gt;<i> a separate interface, instead of being part of the node's interface.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm not 100% sure what this means? Does this relate to possibly
combining with FilePath?

&gt;<i>  * there's concern over the package name.  twisted.tree has
</I>&gt;<i> considerable support :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I kind of like that. I'm not sure what the concern is with 'vfs' though.


&gt;<i> I'll try and make these changes in the next week or so.  If you are
</I>&gt;<i> interested in shaping how this goes, you can track what's going on in
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2815">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2815</A> - just weigh in once the
</I>&gt;<i> ticket goes back to review.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Here's some random stuff that I wanted to at least mention:

- Error translation. This should translate the exception types, but it
should also translate values, so the error contains the virtual path.
- Deferreds. You don't mention them at all, but the lack of
asynchronous interfaces was one of the biggest problems we had with
twisted.vfs.
- URL Escaping. I got bitten by this recently. It's obviously not a
general VFS problem, but it's an issue with enough of them that it
should be considered when defining interfaces.
- &quot;Decorators&quot; like &quot;read-only&quot; and &quot;chroot&quot; could prove useful. Is
there room in the design for such things?
