&gt;<i> One related thing that we spoke about in person was pushing this negotiation

</I>&gt;<i> links, and your backend, the Microsoft Windows filesystem, does not provide
</I>&gt;<i> that feature.&quot;)
</I>
...

&gt;<i> One thing we didn't talk about in person: handling extremely large
</I>&gt;<i> directories.  We had spoken about children() returning a Deferred of a list;
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be nice if it actually had a producer/consumer API of its
</I>&gt;<i> own.  Maybe this is too much of a corner case to worry about in average
</I>&gt;<i> applications (i.e. we could provide a give-me-a-deferred convenience API)
</I>&gt;<i> but it would be nice if it were *possible* to implement things that were
</I>&gt;<i> efficient against really big networked directories.
</I>
I really like these two ideas.  I've noted them down work on.  I think
we agree though that we could get a release out first, and then look
to add these?

&gt;<i> However, this reminds me about another concern which I did not remember to
</I>&gt;<i> raise while Andy was here.  Should this really be twisted.&lt;anything&gt; at all?
</I>&gt;<i>  I'd like twisted &lt;x&gt; &quot;dot products&quot; to generally be an application which
</I>&gt;<i> does something &lt;x&gt;-ish.  I'm aware that not every package follows this rule,
</I>&gt;<i> but the ones that don't are either (A) unmaintained and slated for removal,
</I>&gt;<i> or (B) part of the core, not independent subprojects, as &quot;vfs&quot; seems slated
</I>&gt;<i> to be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Put a different way: what should 'twistd tree' do?  My suggestion would be a
</I>&gt;<i> simple multi-protocol file server: HTTP, FTP (although probably disable that
</I>&gt;<i> by default), SFTP, maybe a &quot;native&quot; protocol for providing a generalized
</I>&gt;<i> backend for any Twisted application that uses the 'tree' API, so that we can
</I>&gt;<i> write a proxy that exposes every arbitrary combination of features from the
</I>&gt;<i> protocols it's talking to.
</I>
I remember a chat I was having with you back in PyCon 2007, about
expanding twistd's command line interface to be able to multiplex
together several different services.

Having a collection of backend implementations available to use with
this would be cool.  But yeah, this could still be be provided without
using a twisted.&lt;x&gt; package.

Here's the vfs plugin so far:

-- Options.longdesc talks about the above idea.  I'm ok either way on
this.

cheers,
Andy.
