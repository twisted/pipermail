It's not very clear what the two different event loops are for.  You
suggest that the synchronous API might be used by the &quot;command line&quot;,
but this doesn't necessarily require a synchronous API.  It's also not
clear if there is going to be a command line tool which is invoking this
API via Python function calls or if it will be talking to a server that
exposes some kind of network interface (since your other use case seems
to involve doing this, it might save you some work to just re-use that).

Another possibility is that the server process will have code running in
it which wants to access this functionality but wants a synchronous API.
My first suggestion is to forget about this and just use the asynchronous
API everywhere.  If that's too hard, then I suggest making two different
APIs.  This shouldn't be very hard (particularly since I think we're
talking about a function that takes a string and returns another string).
Then, code can just use the API that's right for it.

I don't know if this response has made any sense, because I really don't
feel like I understand the question.  If it didn't, maybe you can try to
clarify the question a bit, perhaps providing some examples (either in
English or in Python).
