YAGNI.

More specifically - maybe we will eventually need such a thing.  In the 
process of building a real &quot;SystemStarter&quot; equivalent, however, we may 
find that DependentMultiService actually isn't that useful, and we 
instead want to use some other intermediary dependency management 
strategy.

In a more optimistic case, we're merely maintaining an interface to an 
implementation detail that people shouldn't be using.  In a worse case, 
we have another twisted.python.observable on our hands - dead code that 
one or two things are using because we haven't had time to update them 
to use TwistedStarter instead.

In fact, I think that TwistedStarter sounds like a good idea - it 
provides a high-level interface to some functionality that may be 
tricky to implement correctly.  If you would go all the way and 
implement that I would probably be less unhappy than if this stayed in 
:<i>-).

However, this is just an advice, not an &quot;MDFL pronouncement&quot; - the 
final call on that module is Itamar's, and if he's not going to stop 
you checking it in, then I'll concede.  I was mainly using this as an 
example, not as a particularly egregious thing that really needs to go. 
  I want Twisted developers to consider things like continuing 
maintenance before checking things in.
