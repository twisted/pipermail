Yeah, the problem is that the interface is sufficiently ill-specified 
and lacking in features that folks will depend upon the internals for 
complete semantics.  The goal is to have as few intermediary versions 
of the internal semantics before we arrive at something well-specified 
and good :).

</I>
If I knew exactly how much work it needed, then the work would probably 
have begun :).

However, cred is in an acceptable state at the moment.  Most of the 
cruddiness has to do with backwards-compatibility hacks to a 
significantly worse version of itself.  When these get removed (circa 
Twisted 1.1), there are still a few semantic holes that need to be 
filled, such as the real utility of MultiService, but all in all it 
works as-is.

It's in a much less bad state than twisted.internet.app, at least in my 
opinion ;)
