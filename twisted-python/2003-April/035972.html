<PRE>&gt;<i> If your queries are returning small results, ie,
</I>&gt;<i> non-incremental, I would just set this up as a
</I>&gt;<i> chain of Deferreds and not bother with flow as
</I>&gt;<i> it might be overkill for your needs.
</I>
No, this may be used with a very large amount of data.

 
&gt;<i> In other words, in the twisted.enterprise.adbapi
</I>&gt;<i> when you run a query, it returns a deferred.  So
</I>&gt;<i> DS1 and DS2 would be those query results.
</I>
I agree with that
 
&gt;<i> Your FS1 and FS2 should be deferred operations
</I>&gt;<i> as well, but fired via the 'addCallback' on
</I>&gt;<i> DS1 and DS2 respectively.
</I>
How do you fire it exactly ? Moreover, the tutorial about deferred isn't so
clear for me (twisted newbie).
 
&gt;<i> Then FS3 is a DeferredList taking FS1 and FS2.
</I>
Just a note : this system may be dynamic. I mean that the user can create
the &quot;flow&quot; he wants (with various datasources and other blocs).

&gt;<i> If you can use generators, for more complicated flows,
</I>&gt;<i> etrepum's (Bob Ippolito's) approach may be better approach
</I>&gt;<i> to this, although I'm not sure how it would handle more
</I>&gt;<i> 'fluid' flow through the process.  I need to understand
</I>&gt;<i> what he's doing better.   At first I thought his approach
</I>&gt;<i> is very different than mine, but I think (although I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not quite yet able to explain) that they are isomorphic;
</I>&gt;<i> only that I'm using a temp stack and he's using the
</I>&gt;<i> event queue via a linked-list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I don't really know generators. I'm going to take a look at like tomorow...


&gt;<i> As for the stuff in flow.py, right now it uses a thread
</I>&gt;<i> for each database connection.  Eventually for PostgreSQL,
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to move over to a non-threaded driver.  Gerhard
</I>&gt;<i> was working on such a thing as I remember.  Also, it may
</I>&gt;<i> be renamed since extrepum was using &quot;flow.py&quot; before me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, the database connection is done through a
</I>&gt;<i> QueryIterator which basically sends a set of rows
</I>&gt;<i> (via fetchmany) on to the next stage.  So, the connection
</I>&gt;<i> from DS1 to FS1 and DS2 to FS2 could be done using
</I>&gt;<i> a simple flow for each.  The problem in the flow module
</I>&gt;<i> has to do with merging the two flows.  This can be done
</I>&gt;<i> by using the 'context'.
</I>
3 flows  ? (1 for DS1 to FS1, 1 for DS2 to FS2, and one the merge the 2
others) 

I was thinking of using only one flow. It's weird to seperate this process
in several flow, isn't it ?

 
&gt;<i> In short, it would work, but I'm not sure that it's
</I>&gt;<i> your best option; and I'm still not quite happy with
</I>&gt;<i> flow.py myself (although it is in production).
</I>
thank you for your help
 
&gt;<i> Clark
</I>
Thank very much Clark !
