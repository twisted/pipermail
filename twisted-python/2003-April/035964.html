</I>
Yes, you convinced me that the implementation sucks.  This is
why I'm proposing to check it in to the *sandbox* which has 
explicit warnings about broken code.   Once it is there it
can be worked on incrementally... perhaps by people other
than me.  If it stays private then we will have N people
working on the same thing without a chance of collaboration.

</I>|<i> &gt; should *call* the twistd script via OS methods and
</I>|<i> &gt; thus the refactor above is not needed.  I respectfully
</I>|<i> &gt; disagree with his assertion.
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> Let me explain: the interface to twistd is well defined. It's documented

</I>|<i> extra interfaces where existing ones will do.
</I>
I would hardly call it an extra burden, calling it insane is a
bit over-the-top...  in any case, the refactor makes sense even
without users -- runApp is quite large and the code to fetch
the passphrase really belongs more up-stream.

</I>
I'm not defending twistd, but it does seem to have a wee
bit more functionality than making twisted applications
into daemons.   Perhaps you should refactor it by moving
what *you* think twistd should be into its own module
and make it callable from twistd.   Something like
twisted.python.daemonize would be clean.  No?

Best,

Clark
