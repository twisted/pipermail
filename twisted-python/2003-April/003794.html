That's exactly what it's documented to do. If it's not doing that, it's a bug.
(btw, the current directory gets no special treatment. If it's searching
the current directory, it's because the current directory is somehow in 
sys.path)

It's not using the shell load path. /usr/bin just happens to be in your
sys.path. And, I'm guessing that explicitly checking 1) whether or not
each item is a directory and 2) whether or not that directory has an 
__init__.py is, as you said, more expensive (and checking for __init__.py
is actually trickier than it seems at first, because you also need to
check for .pyc, .pyo, .pyd, .so....).

And inventing a new environment variable is contrary to the stated goal,
which is the lack of a registration process (apart from what you need to do
to have your package work with Python).

Now, are you actually having a *problem* with the performance of mktap?
