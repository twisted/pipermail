I may be missing something, but this seems like a non-sequitur ...
isn't the putative crumminess and/or hugeness of its interface 
independent of the nastiness of its internals?  (Or at least, 
shouldn't it be ...?  But maybe that's part of what you're 
saying ...)

This does not make me feel warm and fuzzy.  ;^)  Okay, 
I admit to having had bad thoughts about cred ... how much 
work do you see it needing?  (Because I'm fixin' to use it 
in the near future ... :^)

Cheers,
