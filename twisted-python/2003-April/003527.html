It is in the CVS version of flow.py... which may not perfectly work
till later this evening.     A copy included below.

''' Flow -- async data flow

    This module provides a mechanism for using async data flows through
    the use of generators.  While this module does not use generators in
    its implementation, it isn't very useable without them.

    A data flow starts with a top level generator, which has numerous
    yield statements.   Each yield can return one of several types:

        flow.Cooperate  This (singleton) value should be returned when 
                        the flow would like to give up control of the 
                        call stack to allow other events to be handled.

        flow.Generator  This is a sub-flow (iterator) to be executed.  
                        This object has a 'result' value which can be 
                        checked for each value yielded.   If the last
                        iteration of the sub-flow produced an exception,
                        then a failure.Failure object will be returned.

                        While the sub-flow is generating (it has not
                        returned or raised StopIteration), it will have
                        an 'active' state of true.  Once it is finished,
                        the 'active' state will be false.

       &lt;anything&gt;       Any other return value, which is not a FlowItem

# The following is a thread package which really is othogonal to

# with the exception of 'Cooperate'.  Although, if you are trying 
# to bring the output of a thread into a Flow, it is exactly what 
# you want.   The QueryIterator is just an obvious application 
# of the ThreadedIterator.

class ThreadedIterator:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
       This is an iterator base class which can be used to build
       iterators which are constructed and run within a Flow
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

class _TunnelIterator:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
       This is an iterator which tunnels output from an iterator
       executed in a thread to the main thread.   Note, unlike
       regular iterators, this one throws a PauseFlow exception
       which must be handled by calling reactor.callLater so that
       the producer threads can have a chance to send events to 
       the main thread.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    def __init__(self, source):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
            This is the setup, the source argument is the iterator
            being wrapped, which exists in another thread.

            This is called in the 'source' thread, and 
            just basically sucks the iterator, appending
            items back to the main thread.
