Well, links could be more intelligent here, and it seems other browsers
manage to figure this out just fine.  Neither the presence of a &lt;!DOCTYPE
...&gt; declaration or the opening &lt;html&gt; tag seem sufficient for links to
realise that it is dealing with actual HTML.  Additionally, I wasn't able to
successfully configure my local links to recognise .xhtml as being
html/plain content, even though the menus seemed to suggest I could (it
happily accepted the entry, but the behaviour was unchanged).

I don't regard it as a major problem, though: in links you can hit &quot;\&quot; and
then it works.  Other browsers I've tried all seem fine -- as is links if
you are reading it off the website, which of course sets the Content-type
HTTP header.  Considering that you are the first person to report this
problem, I doubt this is worth the effort for us to &quot;fix&quot;.  

You are welcome to locally rename or symlink the .xhtml files to .html if
you're really inconvenienced by this ;)

Or you can read the .ps or .pdf format -- or read it from the website, which
works around links' limitations.

The true goal of Twisted is to DESTROY THE SUN, of course.  Random proletysm
is merely a distraction we create so that no-one will stop us!  Muahahahaha!
