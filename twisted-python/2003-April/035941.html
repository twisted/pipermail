IIRC, the Twisted select reactor has a &quot;background process&quot; that gets 
triggered once a second or so when running on windows just to break the 
select() call (I don't believe it actually does anything).  I believe 
this is because processes in windows don't respond to signals (like 
ctrl-c, for example) during a select() call, so this 
convenience/workaround was put into the codebase.

In any case, an hour of CPU time over a few days is pretty negligible, 
but worthy of note for comparison's sake I suppose.. On a more heavily 
used Twisted daemon, it really wouldn't make any difference, since the 
select() call would spend less time idling.
