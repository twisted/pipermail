  Thanks for bringing this up.  I've been wondering about it a bit myself as
well.

&gt;<i> Tests we're having problems with:

  I wouldn't be unhappy if imap4 were left out of the next release, if that
release is done before 1) the protocol support is somewhat stable 2) there
is a mailbox implementation in Twisted proper (I currently have one, but not
in Twisted).

  Of course, I also wouldn't be unhappy if it were included, assuming it is
in reasonable condition when someone actually does go ahead with the
release. 

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How many of these do we have to turn green before we can build the next

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
  Speaking of newjelly... Is it definite yet whether this will be backwards
compatible with the current jelly yet?  I assumed it would not be, but I've
heard some rumors...

  Since our numbering scheme is currently &quot;* glyph rolls dice.&quot;, maybe this
doesn't matter, but I think it *might* be nice if the next release was
1.1.0, if jelly compatibility isn't going to be maintained.

  Jp
