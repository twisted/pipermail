</I>
I'd say there's two types of *users*.  There's no need to listen on
different ports, it's just a matter of who they authenticate as.

&gt;<i> 		* Listen to the admin connection
</I>&gt;<i> 			- Start tournament at admin's command 
</I>&gt;<i> 			  This would create tournament brackets and actually give the
</I>&gt;<i> 			  connected players the &quot;play&quot; command.
</I>&gt;<i> 			- View current games
</I>&gt;<i> 			- A bunch of other things :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then when the admin starts the games, the program would spun a new &quot;game
</I>&gt;<i> thread&quot; that would have the game logic, and that would keep track of the
</I>&gt;<i> game (check legality of moves), tell player A to go, tell B what A play,
</I>&gt;<i> tell B to go, decide on the winner, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But now I find my self trying to think twisted. I am no longer in

</I>&gt;<i> my static info (having my Protocols register them in the Application).
</I>&gt;<i> What I'm having a hard time with is envisioning how to get my games
</I>&gt;<i> started, and how to keep track of them.  
</I>&gt;<i> * Where does my game-logic go?
</I>
I think you want a TournamentService, see
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/pb-cred">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/pb-cred</A> for details of using
Services in the context of PB, but hopefully you can get something out of it
even if you don't use PB.  See doc/examples/pbecho.py for an example of a
simple service.  Basically, it's:

    from twisted.internet.app import Application
    from twisted.cred.service import Service
    from twisted.cred.authorizer import DefaultAuthorizer

    class TournamentService(Service):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Game logic goes here&quot;&quot;&quot;

    myApp = Application('Tournament')
    auth = DefaultAuthorizer(myApp)
    svc = TournamentService('Tournament', myApp, auth)
    myApp.listenTCP(1234, YourProtocolFactory(svc))
    myApp.run()

&gt;<i> * Do my protocols check for valid moves... if so, who keeps track of the
</I>&gt;<i>   board? The board is a share resource between 2 players of a short
</I>&gt;<i>   amount of time, and there are potentially many games going on at the
</I>&gt;<i>   same time.
</I>
I'd have a TournamentService keeping tracking of all the games running at
any time in a dict mapping players to a board.  So when a player sends a
move, the service looks up the player's board, and tells the board what that
player X wants to play move Y, and the board then accepts that or raises an
exception.  It's the board that knows what moves can be played at any given
time; the protocol's job is merely to pass messages to and from the player
on the network.

&gt;<i> * How can I implement timeouts?  So that players have to play within 
</I>&gt;<i>   given time-limits?  (like, X seconds per-move kinds of deals?)  I
</I>&gt;<i>   thougt about starting a timer in my Protocol when a &quot;MAKE A MOVE&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   command is sent to the player, and then checking that time when the
</I>&gt;<i>   move is received... but this seems to involve threads?
</I>
There's plenty of stuff built into Twisted for doing timeouts already, that
doesn't involve threads or anything icky.

You can use reactor.callLater, as described here:
   <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/time">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/time</A>

Depending on what you're doing, you may also find the setTimeout method of
Deferreds to be useful.

&gt;<i> Anyway, I'd really would appreciate your thoughts on this.  This
</I>&gt;<i> 'higher-design' stuff is keeping me from getting dirty :)
</I>
I hope I've made it clearer for you.  Let us know if you're still unsure
about something.

[I think someone wrote a tic-tac-toe example, which might help a little
here... does anyone know where that is?]

-Andrew.
