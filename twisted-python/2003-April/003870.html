I'll make a deal with you - if you do SMTP authentication (demonstrating
the 'right way to do it'), I'll write a similar patch for NNTP :-)

&gt;<i>   I think POP3 should be updated to use cred in a manner similar to that
</I>&gt;<i> which IMAP4 uses it.  Since I wrote IMAP4, obviously I think that is the
</I>&gt;<i> right way to do authentication ;) (modulo one thing - the actual
</I>&gt;<i> challenge/response verification should be factored out and away from the
</I>&gt;<i> Identity class - I believe itamar and glyph have discussed this and have
</I>&gt;<i> some ideas for the implementation).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Whether the *actual* details of how IMAP4 is using cred are proper are
</I>&gt;<i> not, I don't know ;) The code works, but it seems that there are too many
</I>&gt;<i> different objects involved in the process (CramMD5Identity,
</I>&gt;<i> CramMD5ServerAuthenticator, CramMD5ClientAuthenticator - and that's just for
</I>&gt;<i> *one* kind of authentication scheme).  Setup is similarly tedious, requiring
</I>&gt;<i> 4 lines of &quot;boilerplate&quot; to set things up, and then *10* lines to add each
</I>&gt;<i> new identity.  Now that imap4.py is settling down, it'd be great if someone
</I>&gt;<i> with more experience with cred could take a look at it and give me some
</I>&gt;<i> feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Maybe there will be a coil for cred someday so you can keep this part of
</I>&gt;<i> the code out of your actual app, though.  If so, this is one of the real
</I>&gt;<i> strengths of cred.  Your app doesn't have to do anything to manage user
</I>&gt;<i> accounts, you just attach the cred coil and you're done.
</I>
That would be nice.  It seems like there's also the potential to share
the code for different methods of authentication between
POP3/SMTP/IMAP/NNTP - I think they all can use CRAM-MD5, for example,
and it seems silly to duplicate the code in each protocol.
