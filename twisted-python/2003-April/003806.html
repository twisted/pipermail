Because I know :-) The default sys.path isn't there, but your `mktap'
is located in /usr/bin, isn't it? :-)

You probably thought I was being over-assertive because I wasn't explaining
myself fully. I apologize for that. But I did the research, and found out
why this was happening. (more below)

&gt;<i> &gt; And inventing a new environment variable is contrary to the stated goal,

The &quot;Writing Twisted Plugins&quot; section, IIRC.


&gt;<i> And besides and moreover, I may well report a bug, without having an actual

</I>
Trolls like this aren't necessary. If you have a suggestion for improvement
(a special-case for leaving out /usr/bin despite its being in the python
path, for example), then I'll gladly hear it out. But I'm fairly certain
that there's no debate on what the *current* behavior is.

&gt;<i> OK then.  I am now reporting a bug.  The default Python path for this
</I>&gt;<i> Python 2.2.1, which I installed over a SuSE 8.0 Linux distribution, is:
</I>
As I stated above, /usr/bin is in your sys.path because that's probably where
your `mktap' is located. If you don't believe me, modify your local Twisted
installation to add a `print sys.path' to twisted.scripts.mktap.


&gt;<i> Doing `strace mktap', and cleaning out from the result what is expected
</I>&gt;<i> from the current value of `sys.path' (yet without checking if the depth
</I>&gt;<i> of search is reasonable), leaves these to consider, explain and justify:
</I>
Yeah, I examined the output of that strace that you quoted in your original
mail; I discovered, as I had expected, that /usr/bin was in my python path
because that's where `mktap' is located.
