Unless the implementation has changed significantly since I last looked at
it, this is the correct answer.  The select call under win32 times out every
second so that Ctrl-C/Ctrl-Break and other things (like stopping a Twisted
program running as a WinNT service) happen in a timely fashion, rather than
relying on network activity to wake it up.
