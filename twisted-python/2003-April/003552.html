I'm using twisted's Perspective Broker for a generic turn based game engine,
and it works smoothly.  Using PB allows you to write your api almmost as if
networking wasn't involved, excepting only that you'll need to use &quot;callRemote&quot;
for client/server calls instead of normal method calling (and connect your
client/server of course).

The Perspective Broker section on this page was usefull to me:
