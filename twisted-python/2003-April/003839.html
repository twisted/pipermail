</I>
Advantages:
 - keeps the clear error condition when mis-used
 - NOT_DONE_YET uglyness goes away
 - request.finish() can be handled automatically, ie, the
   default errback/callback and the end of the chain can
   make sure that request.finish() is called
 - could provide for better default exception handling,
   the first thing I did as a newbie was dig to find out
   how to get those wonderful traceback pages working
   for deferred failures... why not let it be the default?

I'd add one more... option though:

  4) If request.finish() has already been called, then
     it is acceptable to return None

I've had two use cases for NOT_DONE_YET they are:

   1.  You've already use req.write() several times followed
       by req.finish()... and then return NOT_DONE_YET.   This is
       confusing usage, primarly beacuse you *are* done.   This
       usage is supported by option #4 above.

   2.  You've setup a async call to finish handling the request,
       and in this case, it makes sence to return Deferred.  In
       this case returning NOT_DONE_YET, and having to call 
       req.finish() is just extra, unnecessary baggage; further,
       default error handling isn't provided when it should be.

NOT_DONE_YET is less than optimal in both use cases where it is used,
both of these cases confused a newbie that I was trying to teach.

Best,

Clark
