The way you use it is by replacing the imports at the top of pb.py and 
flavors.py to say &quot;import jelly as newjelly&quot; or &quot;from newjelly import 
...&quot;.  Please do this and see if your problem is solved.  (better yet, 
contribute a unit test so we can make sure future changes don't break 
this either...)

&gt;<i> Am I correct in guessing newjelly.py is intended to be renamed to

</I>
The real issue is that this is a protocol-breaking change, and we're 
not quite prepared to deal with the fallout from that.  Brian Warner 
and I hacked on this at PyCon, and he has some ideas for backwards 
compatible version negotiation, so we may want to keep the old 
implementation around anyway.  When we figure out if and how we're 
going to do backwards compatibility, we'll make the changeover.

Also, the idea behind this implementation was to simplify things so 
that some new kinds of optimizations are possible -- the implementation 
is still really grotty (though it should be functional; I've made the 
aforementioned change to my pb.py and flavors.py and the PB unit tests 
pass), and I want to make sure that these optimizations *are* actually 
made possible, and we haven't just shuffled things around for no reason 
:<i>-)
