Whoooops!  Since all the mailing list messages I get to OK are spam, I 
just scan the headers to make sure it's from someone valid.  This time, 
that meant I OK'd a huuge message (as I rejected 8 other spams...).  
Smart mailing list systems don't help if you have dumb mailing list 
admin.

&gt;<i> Thank you! We will see about fixing this ASAP.

This is a subtle issue... right now we're going to fix it by 
hard-coding /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin as paths that should not be 
checked, but the real problem is an interaction between Python's 
default path behavior, UNIX's filesystem layout, and the way 
twisted.python.plugins works.

Itamar and I had a few ideas for fixing it &quot;for real&quot; but the caveats 
that we would have to put in the documentation are so ugly that we 
discarded them.  Hard coding '/usr/bin' should fix most cases.

While we were in there, we also removed all paths with a '.' in them: 
since these can't be valid Python packages anyway, it doesn't affect 
its correctness, and it has the benefit of making mktap at least 30% 
faster, even without filtering /usr/bin.

Thanks for bringing 'strace mktap' to our attention.  I'm sure 
everybody will appreciate mktap being much less sluggish :).
