Dear Twisted Users,

In the last few months, Twisted seems to have become exponentially more 
popular.  I need to create more graphs and charts that show this in a 
systematic way, but I can certainly tell you that my bandwidth has been 
utilized more than it was in the past.

As many of you know, I host twistedmatrix.com in my home, on a 
&quot;business DSL&quot; line.  All of the Twisted developers use this machine, 
for running tests, running their own development servers, and checking 
their email.  It also runs the twistedmatrix.com web site and CVS 
server.  I like this set-up since it makes it relatively easy to make 
backups quickly, upgrade the hardware on this machine to meet demand, 
and &quot;eat our own dog food&quot;: use various Twisted services in production.

With increased popularity comes increased traffic.  While the CPU of 
our development system remains at near-idle load, the bandwidth here is 
clearly inadequate.  Also, although I do nominally run a business here 
(a few *very* small odd hosting jobs) that's certainly not paying the 
full cost of keeping business DSL running.  I also don't really have a 
good enough set-up to set up a sensible contribution plan like the 
<A HREF="http://www.gnu-darwin.org/">http://www.gnu-darwin.org/</A> site.

So, if you would like to see better performance out of the 
twistedmatrix.com site, I've finally gotten a personal PayPal &quot;donate&quot; 
button working that you can send contributions to.  You can find it on 
my personal website:

	<A HREF="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/users/glyph/scribbles/">http://www.twistedmatrix.com/users/glyph/scribbles/</A>

Please include &quot;bandwidth&quot; in the &quot;special instructions&quot; field that you 
see when you send a contribution.  Also, please don't contribute 
anything if you're struggling yourself.  The developers should be 
beneficiaries of such contributions, not the donors.

Be advised that if I were to somehow become fabulously wealthy from 
these contributions, it would definitely be a good thing for the 
project as a whole ;-).

In related news, we are working on a plan to recognize folks and 
companies who have contributed to development of particular areas of 
Twisted.  As-yet-unacknowledged sponsors include Zoteca, Divmod, and 
Ninjaneering.  If you'd like to be a sponsor of a particular area of 
Twisted development, I'd like to hear from you.

Sometime soon there will definitely be a more structured way to 
organize such efforts, but until then, every little bit helps.  I 
encourage other Twisted developers to get other similar &quot;donate&quot; 
buttons - I would like to put up a &quot;tip jar&quot; page at some point where 
users can select a developer and contribute something.
