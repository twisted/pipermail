&gt;<i> The default sys.path isn't there, but your `mktap' is located in
</I>&gt;<i> /usr/bin, isn't it? :-)
</I>
It is.  Twisted was installed using `root', and with --prefix=/usr.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; And inventing a new environment variable is contrary to the stated goal,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; which is the lack of a registration process [...]
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; Stated where?  The book does not clearly indicate (or I did not read that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part yet) where `.tml' files are exactly looked for.
</I>
&gt;<i> The &quot;Writing Twisted Plugins&quot; section, IIRC.
</I>
I have &quot;3.3 - Writing a New Plug-In for Twisted&quot;, and I presume this is what
you are referring to.  I read that section many times, and once more before
sending the above question, and once more now.
The documentation says that:

   Twisted finds its plug-ins by using pre-existing Python concepts;
   the load path, and packages.  Every top-level Python package[4]
   [...] can potentailly contain some number of plug-ins.  [...] The only
   difference between a package and a drop-in is the existence of a file
   named `plugins.tml' [...] that contains some special Python expression
   to identify the location of sub-packages or modules which can be loaded.

This is the most precise description I could find.  Maybe there is a
linguistic barrier (I'm not an English speaker), but to me, this is a
bit generic.  It is not said that plug-ins _are_ `plugins.tml' files, nor
that those TML files are necessarily at the same place the plug-ins are,
(like next to `__init__.py', say), only their existence is asserted.

It is not so clearly stated either that this is a goal that TML files shall
never be themselves registered.  Maybe you could use my naive reading
as a hint that the documentation could be more precise on these points,
as other readers might have the same interpretation difficulties than me.

&gt;<i> &gt; [...] Being receptive to feedback is a good way to keep it coming,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you know.
</I>
&gt;<i> Trolls like this aren't necessary.
</I>
Hopefully, you'll come to know be better, and discover that I never troll.
I am a peaceful and joyful man, and try to speak in all honesty, always.
Oh, I may tease in a friendly way, but then, there are smileys not far.

&gt;<i> If you have a suggestion for improvement [...] then I'll gladly hear
</I>&gt;<i> it out.
</I>
For now, being a Twisted newcomer that knows very little about it, my
contributions may be timid for a good while.  I'm just sharing the mere
existence of problems I see with my naive eyes, despite I know that in
the area of free software, patches and precise suggestions are usually
quite welcome.  I hope acquiring a bit of competence, and become a better
contributor with the time passing.  Let me apologise for all the false
notes I may sing in the meantime.

&gt;<i> If you don't believe me, modify your local Twisted installation to add a
</I>&gt;<i> `print sys.path' to twisted.scripts.mktap.
</I>
I'm quite willing to believe you, you know! :-)

&gt;<i> [...] /usr/bin is in your sys.path because that's probably where your
</I>&gt;<i> `mktap' is located.
</I>
Is Twisted modifying `sys.path' to include the first part of argv[0]?
Or is it standard Python behaviour?  I never noticed this yet in my own
scripts, but it might just have escaped my attention, and I might not know.
