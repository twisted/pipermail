	Well, it'll need a secondary mechanism anyway, as FAM
	is far from portable.

	Besides, FAM is a daemon. The actual kernel interface
	it uses is called &quot;dnotify&quot;, and it goes like this:

fd = open(&quot;.&quot;, O_RDONLY);
fcntl(fd, F_SETSIG, SIGRTMIN);
fcntl(fd, F_NOTIFY, DN_MODIFY|DN_CREATE|DN_MULTISHOT);

	and you'll get an SIGRTMIN every time the dir changes. Allocating
	an available signal sounds like this is something that should first
	be &quot;twistedified&quot;, and not used raw.

	This might not even need any C wrapping, or at most exposing
	those DN_* and F_* constants.

	If you really want to use that API, and the DN_* constants
	aren't exported by standard python, it'd be trivial to add
	them to eunuchs. And fall back to statting the file every
	once in a while if eunuchs isn't installed or the kernel
	doesn't understand the fcntl.

&gt;<i> &gt; 	I definitely want this implemented. Please tell what direction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	should I go with the patch, and what do you think is missing

</I>&gt;<i>   It basically looks good.  One thing I'd like done differently is to have
</I>&gt;<i> parseConfig() called at a different time.  Possibly calling it as a result
</I>&gt;<i> of connectionMade() further increases an already large latency on queries. 
</I>&gt;<i> If this were done in a callLater() loop, this would keep the parsing
</I>&gt;<i> overhead out of the path of actual queries the client performs.
</I>
	Yeah, sure. I ended up doing it that way just because I couldn't
	remember whether callLaters etc are pickled or not, and make it
	resume from a .tap correctly, etc..

&gt;<i>   As a short term solution, I think this is reasonable (but the point is
</I>&gt;<i> moot if we wrap and use libfam).  How's it sound to you?
</I>
	Okay, how about I make it check the file timestamp every n seconds
	via callLater, and commit that? Maybe tomorrow.
