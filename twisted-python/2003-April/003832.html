The reasoning behind not allowing None as a default value is that 
forgetting is too easy.  If you're writing a simple request that has a 
render() method that looks like

     def render(self, request):
         if self.authenticated:
             return self.goodies

the default behavior should not be &quot;hang forever&quot;.

&gt;<i>         Err, this isn't exactly what I was thinking.  What

</I>&gt;<i>         req.finish() would be called automagically.
</I>
What if you wanted to start writing the page in the render() method but 
keep writing it later?  Then we have None as a synonym for NOT_DONE_YET 
except in certain situations where you've done something to the request?

&gt;<i> |   2.  Alternatively, allow a Deferred to be a return

</I>&gt;<i> |       result.finish() to the deferred chain.   This

</I>&gt;<i> |       a string, a Deferred, (or for backwards compatibiliy
</I>&gt;<i> |       NOT_DONE_YET).  In either of the primary cases,
</I>&gt;<i> |       result.finish() always gets called... thus making
</I>&gt;<i> |       it easier on newbies.
</I>
I've discussed this with several different people at various times... 
the trouble is, there isn't really a use-case that Deferreds make 
easier.  render() ends up being a relatively low-level interface, and 
the NOT_DONE_YET/write/finish API is quite convenient for the stuff 
that has been implemented with it.

I am definitely a True Believer in the Deferred, but in this case it 
just doesn't seem worth the inconvenience of deprecating things and 
shuffling stuff around for a vanishingly small benefit.
