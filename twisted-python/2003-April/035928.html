I just took the shortcut of replacing jelly.py with newjelly.py, as I didn't
want to hunt down imports to change.  I got several errors, and hence
wondered if it was finished, e.g.

I get this Traceback when sending from Perspective -&gt; Client
...
  File &quot;...jelly.py&quot;, line 536, in _unjelly_tuple
    if preTuple.resolvedObject is None:
exceptions.AttributeError: _Tuple instance has no attribute 'resolvedObject'

After this error I get a similar error (when sending from Client -&gt;
Perspective) where a local variable that is set on my Perspective before
calling a &quot;remote&quot; client method is later missing when the client calls a
&quot;perspective&quot; method.

I haven't looks more closely than this though.


I posted a test case demonstrating the &quot;circular ref&quot; bug a couple of
messages up this thread, but didn't work out a unit test.  I'll try to get
some time to do that, although I understand twisted uses something other than
pyunit so I'm not sure what's involved.

A cursory glance at newjelly.py makes me think it can't possibly have the
same problem, as &quot;references&quot; and &quot;derefences&quot; now seem to be treated in the
same manner, and presumably your unit tests cover simple references. ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt; Am I correct in guessing newjelly.py is intended to be renamed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; jelly.py, but isn't ready yet?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The real issue is that this is a protocol-breaking change, and we're
</I>&gt;<i> not quite prepared to deal with the fallout from that.  Brian Warner
</I>&gt;<i> and I hacked on this at PyCon, and he has some ideas for backwards
</I>&gt;<i> compatible version negotiation, so we may want to keep the old
</I>&gt;<i> implementation around anyway.  When we figure out if and how we're
</I>&gt;<i> going to do backwards compatibility, we'll make the changeover.
</I>
Isn't all the Jelly/Unjelly code pretty well encapsulated, so that others
needed really care how it works internally?

&gt;<i> Also, the idea behind this implementation was to simplify things so
</I>&gt;<i> that some new kinds of optimizations are possible -- the implementation
</I>&gt;<i> is still really grotty (though it should be functional; I've made the
</I>&gt;<i> aforementioned change to my pb.py and flavors.py and the PB unit tests
</I>&gt;<i> pass), and I want to make sure that these optimizations *are* actually
</I>&gt;<i> made possible, and we haven't just shuffled things around for no reason
</I>&gt;<i> :-)
</I>
For what it's worth (after a cursory glance), the reference/dereference
cleanup part of your changes looks like a clear improvement, but in
understandability and correctness. :-)
