Usage and behaviour of a PullProducer isn't clear to me.  Does
PullProducer.resumeProducing mean that it should call consumer.write
exactly once?  Or is the amount of times consumer.write will be called
undefined or context-dependent but merely guaranteed to be finite?

A PushProducer delivers an undefined quantity of data to consumer.write
some unknown time after resumeProducing is called.  A PullProducer
delivers an undefined quantity of data to consumer.write some unknown
time after resumeProducing is called.  So why two interfaces?  Why don't
pulling consumers just use pauseProducing upon getting a .write?[1] 
Then we can ditch one of the interfaces and the 'streaming' argument to
registerProducer and the conditionals that go with it...

If it is a different interface, can we give the method a different
name?  I think it strange that you call &quot;resume&quot; on these when producing
has never been &quot;paused&quot;.  And that &quot;resume&quot; in this case does not signal
a return to an ongoing process from which it has been interrupted, but
is a single  request for a discrete amount of data.  A name beginning
with &quot;get&quot; or &quot;next&quot; seems more fitting.

[1] &quot;...just use pauseProducing upon getting a write()?&quot;: One answer to
that could be &quot;it's more message traffic&quot;; every write in a
pull-producer implemented on PushProducer this way would involve
p.resume();c.write();p.pause() as opposed to just p.resume();c.write(). 
But that alone doesn't convince me the interface confusion is worth it.
