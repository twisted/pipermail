  If your &quot;twistd&quot; is in /usr/bin, then the '' at the beginning of sys.path
refers to /usr/bin.  It is not at all clear to me that it would be correct
to remove '' from the .tml search path.  It would result in greatly enhanced
mktap performance, but it could also lead to confusing behavior (and the
behavior of .tml searching is more than confusing enough already).

</I>
  I certainly wouldn't ;)

  What twisted/python/plugins.py does is not particularly difficult.  Python
makes it difficult to do efficiently (perhaps because it is difficult to do
efficiently in a platform independant way).  If someone with more POSIX-foo
than I could take a good look at what it does, and see if there really is a
portable way we could implement parts of it in C (and maybe get those bits
added to Python itself), that'd be fantastic.

  Thanks again for the bug reports.  Please, keep them coming :)
