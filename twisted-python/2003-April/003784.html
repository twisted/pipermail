to be honest - nothing - I have my own version based .10 and patches
hand applied as needed up to version .13.  With it being deployed on as
many systems we do the process of upgrading is not something we do
often.

I have not come across anything I was not able to do with ldaptor.  I
dont push it to hard, just a lot of searches and maybe a password change or
two. 

I don't really like the DNS SRV records and that way of connecting.  So 
I just don't use it.  

We have added TLS support to ldaptor to go along with the TLS patch I 
wrote for twisted.  I am not able to release that patch due to it was 
created by working with another employee.

One thing I would kill to have is the server side of things in twisted.
This would allow me to build the ldap caching daemon / proxy daemon. nscd
on Solaris is a pile of junk, but an absolute need for nsswitch with ldap.  
And just be damn fun to play with.  But I will be damned if I know anyone 
that wants to write it. 

Thank you once again for creating ldaptor, it has save this sysadmin
untold hours of config changes and has been fun to play with.
