  The &quot;usability&quot; of t.names could be a bit better, I agree.

  It would be great if Twisted could speak FAM.  I looked briefly at
integrating the python wrapper, but didn't have time to go very in-depth. 

&gt;<i>

  It basically looks good.  One thing I'd like done differently is to have
parseConfig() called at a different time.  Possibly calling it as a result
of connectionMade() further increases an already large latency on queries. 
If this were done in a callLater() loop, this would keep the parsing
overhead out of the path of actual queries the client performs.

  As a short term solution, I think this is reasonable (but the point is
moot if we wrap and use libfam).  How's it sound to you?
