  If you don't get to it first, I may end up doing SMTP authentication
sometime in the near future (as I have need for it as well).  I hadn't given
much thought to NNTP.

</I>
  I think POP3 should be updated to use cred in a manner similar to that
which IMAP4 uses it.  Since I wrote IMAP4, obviously I think that is the
right way to do authentication ;) (modulo one thing - the actual
challenge/response verification should be factored out and away from the
Identity class - I believe itamar and glyph have discussed this and have
some ideas for the implementation).

  Whether the *actual* details of how IMAP4 is using cred are proper are
not, I don't know ;) The code works, but it seems that there are too many
different objects involved in the process (CramMD5Identity,
CramMD5ServerAuthenticator, CramMD5ClientAuthenticator - and that's just for
*one* kind of authentication scheme).  Setup is similarly tedious, requiring
4 lines of &quot;boilerplate&quot; to set things up, and then *10* lines to add each
new identity.  Now that imap4.py is settling down, it'd be great if someone
with more experience with cred could take a look at it and give me some
feedback.

  Maybe there will be a coil for cred someday so you can keep this part of
the code out of your actual app, though.  If so, this is one of the real
strengths of cred.  Your app doesn't have to do anything to manage user
accounts, you just attach the cred coil and you're done.


  Hope this helps,

  Jp
