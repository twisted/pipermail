We currently are using Twisted (just upgraded to 1.0.4) along with Zope 2.5.1,
Zope for the &quot;front end&quot; (but only for as long as it takes until we can remove it)
and Twisted for the &quot;back end&quot; of our application.  Zope still uses Python 2.1
so we would be unable to do this with Python 2.2.  Since we will definitely
have excised all traces of Zope by the time anything really changes with
Twisted and 2.2, I'm not seriously concerned but I thought I'd note it as
an interesting data point.

Also perhaps interesting, though off-topic, is that we patched 1.0.3 to
run under Python 2.0 (just a few quick hacks) successfully, as we are
still using that on our network for development, even though this one
particular application deploys with Python 2.1.  It was rather simple
with 1.0.3 although I'm not sure whether we'll have better or worse
luck when we try this with 1.0.4.  Chances are the nested scopes have
propagated throughout more of the code now...

&gt;<i> 2. Do you have any Twisted success stories you'd like to share (besides
</I>&gt;<i> those listed in our success stories page, of course)?
</I>
Eventually we will have something more official to report, but just for
this list, unofficially :-), for now, I'd like to report that Kaval
Wireless Technologies Inc (www.kaval.com) is integrating Twisted into a 
server application which is used to monitor equipment in wireless coverage 
extension systems.  (The monitoring links themselves are not wireless, so Twisted
is carrying only data which travelled as electrons, not as radio waves...)

Until now we'd been using Zope, but it was really not the most appropriate
choice since this isn't a content management system.  Twisted appears
more robust, lighter weight, and likely to prove much more amenable to
rapid development on our end, and as a hardcore XP team we highly
appreciate the XP approach of the Twisted team and look forward to
contributing as we learn more.  I don't want to diminish Zope, which
provided an effective platform at an earlier stage, but we've definitely
grown beyond it and are tightly constrained by its limitations and
difficult development model.
