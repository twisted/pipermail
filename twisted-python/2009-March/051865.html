I use Axiom (for Mantissa, a somewhat general-purpose application server,
for Quotient, a mail server based on it, for Imaginary, a text adventure
server based on it, for Blendix, a person aggregator based on it, for
Merit, a test results database, etc) most of the time.  I know some other
people are using Storm.

Overall, I think that the way all existing ORMs work (including Axiom and
Storm) is hostile towards the typical Twisted program structure (or vice
versa, or both).  So it's tough.  The approach Axiom takes is to warn you
that any database operation you perform must complete quickly or your app
will suffer, and to restrict you to SQLite, so network issues can't hurt
you.
