</I>
I haven't looked at how web2 handles IByteStream providers, but my first
guess would be that this is an example of a somewhat common bug where
Deferreds are chained to an arbitrary length based on application data
and when there's too much application data, the chain gets too long (a
limit imposed by how much recursion is possible when unwinding the chain),
and you get this failure.

Alternatively, the bug I describe above might somehow have gotten into
your application code, rather than into Web2.  As you say, the stack
trace doesn't point to your code, but it doesn't point to Web2 code
either, and it's common in cases like this for the traceback to just
point at the implementation of Deferred, since that's where the bug
(or lack of feature, whatever) *really* is.

The main focus of web development in Twisted now is Twisted Web, not
Twisted Web2.  However, if you can supply a patch which fixes this
(along with unit tests, please :), then we'd be happy to apply it.

James Knight or David Reid might have a suggestion about where in the
code to start looking for the problem.
