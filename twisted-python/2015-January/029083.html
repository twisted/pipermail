One of those things.  There is no infrastructure in place for identifying events which impact the performance testing infrastructure.  The only performance testing environment is a very old mac mini still running Snow Leopard, which is probably the environment which we care the *least* about performance in, so it's not in great shape ;).

&gt;<i> I'd say: the infrastructure aspects when doing performance tests do matter. To the degree that performance results are of very limited value at all, if the former aspects are not accounted for.
</I>
I don't think the results that we have presently are worth much at all.  My point was mostly that there is some infrastructure which is halfway usable, and so you don't have to start from scratch.  If you could take over this project (I am pretty sure at this point there is nobody to take it over *from*, exarkun did some work a long time ago and hasn't given it a second look in years) it would be highly appreciated!

(And if you care a lot about performance in a particular environment you could set it up in that environment and get attention for it :)).

You should also have a look at the existing benchmark suite and potentially look at maintaining / expanding that as well.

Thoughts?
