I wasn't suggesting it would be a good idea to contribute to codespeed. 
I think codespeed should be thrown in the trash.  It was a great 
demonstration of a concept and we should thank it for that.  However, as 
the basis of future development - no, it's an awful piece of 
unmaintained software.

I was just trying to say that work towards replacing it should learn 
what it can from codespeed to try to avoid creating another piece of 
awful, ultimately unmaintained software.
