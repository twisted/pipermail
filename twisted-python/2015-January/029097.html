<PRE>First, sorry for sluggish response time ..

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>E.g. I need latency histograms, but this seems unsupported (benchmark results can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>only have avg/min/max/stddev). For me, this isn't &quot;nice to have&quot;, but essential.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Throughput is one thing. Constistent low latency a completely different. The latter is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>much much harder.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>Codespeed is terrible. &#160;But this is not one of the ways in which it is terrible. &#160;Codespeed doesn't care if you label your measurement &quot;latency&quot;. &#160;I think you've just noticed that what the existing benchmarks measure is mostly (entirely?) throughput. &#160;If you wanted to &gt;&gt;write a latency benchmark, I don't think anything's stopping you.
</I>
&gt;<i>I believe Tobias was not saying &quot;codespeed can't have a measurement called 'latency'&quot; but rather &quot;codespeed can't do histograms of measurements, which we need for measurement of latency and you don't need for measurement of throughput&quot;. &#160;Is that accurate? &#160;I don't know if there's a histogram feature hidden in the UI somewhere.
</I>
Yes, exactly. That's what I meant.

As an example of the kind of analysis and visualization I am after, please have a look here:

<A HREF="http://www.brendangregg.com/HeatMaps/latency.html">http://www.brendangregg.com/HeatMaps/latency.html</A>

In particular, latency heatmaps are an incredible useful visualization.

<A HREF="http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html#HeatMaps">http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html#HeatMaps</A>

&gt;<i>It would be nice to at least try a little bit to contribute things (like a histogram feature) to codespeed before charging off in a completely different direction.
</I>
It is Django and canvas for gfx.

The former I have no know-how and no use/motivation for. Rendering HTML on the server isn't something we do anymore (WebSocket talking WAMP to Crossbar.io, anything else is just static HTML/JS/CSS/Images).

For the latter, there is D3 (<A HREF="http://d3js.org/">http://d3js.org/</A>) which is awesome and vector graphics.

For heatmaps, canvas _might_ be fine, but for virtually anything chart like, D3 has a lot to bring to the table.

In general, I can follow the argument of &quot;contributing instead of reinventing&quot; and &quot;paying back&quot;, but in this particular case, I can't justify sinking time into this (codespeed).

Cheers,
/Tobias
