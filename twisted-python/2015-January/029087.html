<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Probably the test machine was changed, a new version of OpenSSL or
</I>&gt;<i> pyOpenSSL, or something else?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One of those things.  There is no infrastructure in place for identifying events
</I>&gt;<i> which impact the performance testing infrastructure.  The only performance
</I>
Yes, this is an important point: track changes in infrastructure (everything that might
have an influence, but is outside the tested code).

&gt;<i> testing environment is a very old mac mini still running Snow Leopard, which
</I>
omg;)

&gt;<i> &gt; I'd say: the infrastructure aspects when doing performance tests do
</I>&gt;<i> matter. To the degree that performance results are of very limited value at
</I>&gt;<i> all, if the former aspects are not accounted for.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think the results that we have presently are worth much at all.  My
</I>&gt;<i> point was mostly that there is some infrastructure which is halfway usable,
</I>&gt;<i> and so you don't have to start from scratch.  If you could take over this
</I>
You mean taking over the code &quot;as is&quot;

<A HREF="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~twisted-dev/twisted-benchmarks/trunk/files">http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~twisted-dev/twisted-benchmarks/trunk/files</A>

or the task in general (Twisted benchmarking)?

&gt;<i> project (I am pretty sure at this point there is nobody to take it over *from*,
</I>
We are currently developing performance test infrastructure for Crossbar.io - naturally,
it is eating it's own dog food: the infrastructure is based on Crossbar.io and WAMP to
orchestrate and wire up things in a distributed test setup.

We could extend that to test at the Twisted(-only) level. Need to think about how
that fits into &quot;overall strategy&quot;, as the Crossbar.io perf. test stuff isn't open-source.

The testing hardware above (mac, no real network) is insufficient for what I need.
I'm thinking about buying and setting up 2 more boxes for Linux.

Rgd. Codespeed (<A HREF="https://github.com/tobami/codespeed">https://github.com/tobami/codespeed</A>), which seems to be used
by speedcenter.twistedmatrix.com: I have issues here as well.

E.g. I need latency histograms, but this seems unsupported (benchmark results can
only have avg/min/max/stddev). For me, this isn't &quot;nice to have&quot;, but essential. 
Throughput is one thing. Constistent low latency a completely different. The latter is
much much harder.

But what is the &quot;interface&quot; between test cases from &quot;twisted-benchmarks&quot; to codespeed?

This

<A HREF="https://github.com/tobami/codespeed#saving-data">https://github.com/tobami/codespeed#saving-data</A>

seems to suggest, performance test results are HTTP/POSTed as JSON to codespeed.

And codespeed is then only responsible for visualization and web hosting, right?

I think we can find something better for that part.

&gt;<i> (And if you care a lot about performance in a particular environment you
</I>&gt;<i> could set it up in that environment and get attention for it :)).
</I>
Yes, in particular that very last one is a factor to justify efforts;) Anything like having
a promo logo or similar - that would be an argument to invest time and material.
I will seriously contemplate .. need to align with strategy/available time.

We already host FreeBSD buildslaves for both Twisted and PyPy. That might be another
synergy (hosting the latter on that same boxes).

&gt;<i> You should also have a look at the existing benchmark suite and potentially
</I>&gt;<i> look at maintaining / expanding that as well.
</I>
I will try to integrate some of this into our upcoming perf. infrastructure.
