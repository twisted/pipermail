In my unfortunately somewhat uninformed opinion, one thing that can really help is not to commit to long-term stability, but rather to just have a clearly documented log of operations performed on the monitoring cluster.  Twisted has far less intense performance-analysis requirements than Mozilla, I should hope, and a lot less data to deal with, so just the ability to see events on the X axis could be enough to tell contributors what's going on with performance deltas.

I should point out that the main reason we need a performance testing rig is not continuous performance monitoring over time, but rather, clear performance tracking of individual changes, ideally before they land.  One of the things I'm unhappy about with speed center (and a big reason it's basically unmaintained) is that it's very hard to tell it to build a branch and to get a good picture of the aggregate effect of that branch on the benchmarks.
