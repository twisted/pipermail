I think you've just noticed that what the existing benchmarks measure is mostly (entirely?) throughput.  If you wanted to write a latency benchmark, I don't think anything's stopping you.

I believe Tobias was not saying &quot;codespeed can't have a measurement called 'latency'&quot; but rather &quot;codespeed can't do histograms of measurements, which we need for measurement of latency and you don't need for measurement of throughput&quot;.  Is that accurate?  I don't know if there's a histogram feature hidden in the UI somewhere.

It would be nice to at least try a little bit to contribute things (like a histogram feature) to codespeed before charging off in a completely different direction.
