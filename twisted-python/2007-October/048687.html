<PRE>   Hi all,

I'm trying to write a server script that can pass the received data  
on (acting as a client) to a next server.
Say, server A receives data from client B, and then acts as client A  
(while keeping in contact with client B) for server C.
I'm using it to pass data through an extra machine before reaching  
the actual machine, where the extra machine serves as a security  
measure (eg, if that gets hacked, that won't bring too may other  
things down).

I'm new to Twisted, so I'm not sure where to find information on  
this. I've been looking at creating a client at the moment that the  
server receives data (in the dataReceived() method), but then I get  
two factory.run() methods, and would also need to find a way to stop  
the client; that doesn't seem to be correct. Or perhaps using  
threads, but then I don't know how to pass the data from the server  
to client.
Best to me would to have both connections active, each on their own  
port, and when data is received, 'something' in the client part gets  
called that sends these data on.
Alternatively, I could simply call an external program with the data  
as arguments from the server script, but I'd like a all-in-one  
solution if possible. Or perhaps I'm looking at this the wrong way?  
(Although I'd prefer not to try and turn 'server C' into 'client C'.)

Any suggestions or pointers?

Thanks in advance,

   Evert
