</I>I understand that PB is still maintained, but it's also a dead end 
without further development, and rather lacking in a few areas.  From 
the bits I've seen Foolscap looks like it'll be enough of an improvement 
that I'll happily switch when it's done.  I'd actually switch now, but I 
need something stable for the time being.

I hadn't been aware of AMP; after a quick look at the docs it seems a 
bit low level for my purposes though, as I need to do more than just 
send messages.
