reinventing the wheel, but I rather see this a an exercise.

</I>Okay, I agree. To get away somewhat from parsers, the question arises 
for other programming tasks as well, of course.

So I already asked myself how one would translate the example of a 
factorial function in twisted's core documentation to use the reactor's 
scheduling mechanism instead of running it in a thread. I think an 
example of how to divide it into chunks and how to use the reactor would 
be great.

What I tried at first was programming a simple counter this way. It 
would look much similar to the code I presented in reply to Itamar 
Shtull-Trauring's answer. What I'm not sure about is if this is the 
correct way to go for.

Many thanks for all the other points you've answered, it made a lot of 
things much clearer to me.

Jürgen
