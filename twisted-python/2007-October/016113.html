The following will cause an AssertionError

d = Deferred()
d2 = Deferred()

d2.callback(d)

There isn't really a good reason to do this anyway.  Since there is  
likely no reason to not just return d with your callbacks attached.   
If you do need two deferreds here for some reason, you _can_ return a  
deferred from a callback.  In which case further callbacks will not  
be called until the second deferred has fired.
