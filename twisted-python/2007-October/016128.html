</I>&gt;<i> &gt;No content in the error.  Line 238 of twisted/internet/defer.py (first

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;assert not isinstance(result, Deferred)

What is that assertion guarding against then?  Seems to me like it is
explicitly preventing you from doing this:

d1 = Deferred()
d2 = Deferred()
d1.callback(d2)

In fact, that exact code raises the AssertionError in question.  If
the intention is to allow this, then the assertion needs to be
removed.

&gt;<i> The rest of this thread
</I>&gt;<i> seems to go off on some tangent about threads which may or may not be
</I>&gt;<i> relevant to whatever problem you're trying to solve.  What led you to
</I>&gt;<i> be reading this code in the first place?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Glyph did make a good point, though.  You shouldn't ever have a Deferred
</I>&gt;<i> in a thread other than the reactor thread.  You shouldn't make them, you
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't add callbacks to them, you shouldn't call them back.  It might
</I>&gt;<i> be legitimate to get one from the reactor thread, hold it for a while,
</I>&gt;<i> then send it back to the reactor thread, but I can't think of a case
</I>&gt;<i> where this would really be very useful.
</I>
Yes, and thanks for that.  I was creating a Deferred and adding a
callback in a thread, so in fixing that, the assertion above no longer
comes into play.
