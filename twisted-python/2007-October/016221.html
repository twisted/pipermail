The API docs are nice (in places), but nothing really beats diving into the
source itself.  There are some areas of Twisted which use obscure techniques
to achieve a goal, but for the most part the code isn't too hard to follow
(and this is improving all the time).  If I had the code in front of me again
I could probably tell you the particular path I traced up from your code into
conch to find a point where it was clear that the &quot;closed&quot; method is what you
want to override, but I don't at the moment - but that's all I did, looked at
the source, figured out what was called by what, step by step until I found
the feature you were interested in.  Now, I've used conch before, and maybe
even this feature of it, but I didn't consciously remember the answer until
I saw it in the code again this time.  Previous experience might have guided
me a bit in the right direction, but not much beyond that.

I might be able to provide some more specific guidance if you're still not
finding what you need, but probably not until sometime next week.
