</I>&gt;<i> Our policy says &quot;buildbot builder&quot; explicitly as the basis for support. Plus, Travis is some Pythons yolo'd onto a random Ubuntu for the purposes of smoke testing for people without access to our full build fleet; and the support for Python in Twisted has so far been on the basis of &quot;what are people actually using&quot; -- hence why we don't have a 3.3 or 3.4, as they are only generally available on EOL'd or enterprise distributions (which are unlikely to be used by people who want/can get the newest Twisted).
</I>
Counterpoint: `docker pull python:3.4`.

The 'yolo'd versions are nevertheless builds of the official pythonX.Y source, and &quot;custom build&quot; is a configuration that huge numbers of very prominent users stick to these days.

&gt;<i> My guess is that when the policy was written, a project had to maintain its own CI infrastructure
</I>&gt;<i> because nothing out there was freely available that was good enough.  Basically, the Twisted project
</I>&gt;<i> could either use its own self-maintained buildbot CI infrastructure, or jhave no CI at all.
</I>
This guess is pretty much accurate.  At the time, &quot;buildbot&quot; was a synonym for &quot;CI&quot;, and that is entirely the spirit in which it was written.

&gt;<i> The landscape has changed a lot now.
</I>&gt;<i> With Github + Travis/Appveyor/etc. are very good for CI.  While the configurations and versions of the OS and software
</I>&gt;<i> used by Travis and Appveyor are out of the control of the Twisted project, they are quite good for most purposes.
</I>&gt;<i> I would say that the Windows configurations on Appveyor are as good or better than Twisted's Windows buildbots.
</I>
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves :-).

The Appveyor setup is to test Windows server builds, and the buildbots are to ensure that desktop versions that users actually use are still supported.

&gt;<i> I don't really think that Twisted's buildbot infrastructure is some holy grail of &quot;what are people actually using&quot;.
</I>
Indeed not.

&gt;<i> I think it is fair to say that the Twisted's buildbot infrastructure represents what the Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> project managed to set up and get working at some point of time, and the buildbots cover a good cross-section
</I>&gt;<i> of configurations and operating systems that are not covered by Travis/Appveyor/etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it is best for the Twisted release engineer to look at the results of all the Travis/Appveyor builds *and* the buildbot builds
</I>&gt;<i> and decide what is supported or not.  That already happens now, because some of the buildbot builds are tagged as unsupported.
</I>
I basically agree with all of this, and I think the policy language should be changed to better reflect its original intent in a modern context.
