<PRE>Hi,

I tried to set up a VM to test changes to Twisted's buildbot.

I did this:


git clone <A HREF="https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid">https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid</A>
cd braid
vagrant up
fab config.vagrant
fab config.vagrant base.bootstrap
fab config.vagrant buildbot.install


I got some errors at this point (see attached log).

Any ideas how to get this working?

Thanks.
