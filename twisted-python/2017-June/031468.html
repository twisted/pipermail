</I>My guess is that when the policy was written, a project had to maintain its
own CI infrastructure
because nothing out there was freely available that was good enough.
Basically, the Twisted project
could either use its own self-maintained buildbot CI infrastructure, or
jhave no CI at all.

The landscape has changed a lot now.
With Github + Travis/Appveyor/etc. are very good for CI.  While the
configurations and versions of the OS and software
used by Travis and Appveyor are out of the control of the Twisted project,
they are quite good for most purposes.
I would say that the Windows configurations on Appveyor are as good or
better than Twisted's Windows buildbots.

I don't really think that Twisted's buildbot infrastructure is some holy
grail of &quot;what are people actually using&quot;.

I think it is fair to say that the Twisted's buildbot infrastructure
represents what the Twisted
project managed to set up and get working at some point of time, and the
buildbots cover a good cross-section
of configurations and operating systems that are not covered by
Travis/Appveyor/etc.

I think it is best for the Twisted release engineer to look at the results
of all the Travis/Appveyor builds *and* the buildbot builds
and decide what is supported or not.  That already happens now, because
some of the buildbot builds are tagged as unsupported.
