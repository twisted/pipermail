-----------------------------
|<i>Dear All
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>I am interested in writing an MRCP (Media Resource Control Protocol
</I>|<i>[1]) server. 
</I>
Great. I did that for a Brazilian company. It was not a full MRCP
server, just enough to cope with their TTS needs. But I will be glad
to give advice and help.

|<i> In particular I want to write an MRCP speech recognition
</I>|<i>resource server as part of my trefnydd [2] project.
</I>
That is about the opposite of what I have explored (synthesis) ;o)

|<i>  I am posting here to ask for advice about the network programming part.
</I>
My MRCP server followed [1], and was based on RTSP for session handling,
instead of SIP.

|<i>I shall also be writing an MRCP client (if only to test the server).
</I>|<i>All the code will be GPL'd.
</I>
That is great. I hope I can contribute with that. The project we 
(me and Jo√£o Chaves Jr) have worked on was proprietary software.
That was an imposition from the client, and a source of great frustration
for me. :o(

|<i>As far as I understand it, an overview of the networking would go like
</I>|<i>this:
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>An MRCP session between client and server is initiated using the
</I>|<i>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).
</I>
The version I worked on, was based in RTSP not SIP.
From the spec:
&quot;&quot;&quot;
  This protocol is designed to work with streaming
  protocols like RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) 
  or SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)
&quot;&quot;&quot;

So if you need a MRCP server that is SIP-based for doing ASR,
then I cannot help much since I have experience with a
RTSP-based for doing TTS ;o)
That does not mean I won't give advice if I have any worth giving! 

|<i>Client and server negotiate using
</I>|<i>SIP messages containing SDP message bodies to define the participants
</I>|<i>and the resources required in the session.
</I>
Correct.

|<i>After session initiation, two channels are launched: a media channel 
</I>|<i> using RTP to carry binary audio (i.e., speech) data,
</I>
Right. I used a wrapper over JRTPLIB to handle RTP and RTCP. 

|<i> and a control channel using TCP (control
</I>|<i>channel messages are text-based and in MRCP format).
</I>
Well, the RTSP-based verison used the same RTSP channel to
tunnel session initiation (pure RTSP) and media control
(MRCP payloads embedded in RTSP announce messages).
I do not know how this is handled with SIP.


|<i>It seems to me that both client and server software would have to cope
</I>|<i>with SIP, SDP, RTP, MRCP (message format) and plain old TCP (for the
</I>|<i>SIP/SDP and MRCP control channel messages).
</I>
Sounds about right.


|<i>Here are my questions:
</I>|<i>
</I>|<i>- Does anyone know of a FOSS project to write an MRCP server?
</I>|<i>preferably in python. I know of mrcp4j [3].
</I>
Not that I know of.

|<i>- My first plan would be to make the MRCP client/server a subclass of
</I>|<i>an SIP client/server, as SIP is used to set up (and tear down) the
</I>|<i>session.  Does that sound sensible?
</I>
I used Twisted HTTP handling implementation as a starting point for
the RTSP implementation since both protocols are very much alike.

I wish you luck and success.

best regards,
Rod Senra
