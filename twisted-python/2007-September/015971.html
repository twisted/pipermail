Not true, in fact.  See twisted/conch/stdio.py, for example.  I don't know
what the Twisted/IPython integration code ended up looking like (or if it
was ever taken to a satisfactory &quot;completion&quot; point) but I don't think it
is necessary to have multiple threads for that use case, either.

&gt;<i>But, I have never seen a

Why isn't a solution based on Twisted's thread-safe event-posting API 
(reactor.callFromThread) and the thread-safe event-posting API of whatever
other thing is being integrated with &quot;really&quot; thread-safe?  Sure, you can
write programs which will deadlock as a result of application-level bugs
where one thread is blocked on a request and the other thread needs some
information from it before the request can be satisfied, but this is inherent
to wanting to drive an asynchronous API synchronously.  Aside from it, I
don't think there are any problems with what I described above.
