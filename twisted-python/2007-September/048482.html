<PRE>I take most of this back.  I just saw that in twisted.internet.threads
there is now a

blockingCallFromThread

function that does this exactly.  Last time I looked at the ticket
that led to this, there were still some things being worked out.  This
look very nice though!

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;This is a usage case that we run into regularly.  We have a lot of PB
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;based servers, but sometimes people want to use a client to them from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;an interactive Python or IPython prompt.  At that point you have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;run the reactor in a different thread.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not true, in fact.  See twisted/conch/stdio.py, for example.  I don't know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what the Twisted/IPython integration code ended up looking like (or if it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was ever taken to a satisfactory &quot;completion&quot; point) but I don't think it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is necessary to have multiple threads for that use case, either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have, but this doesn't solve the problem as I recall.  First, these
</I>&gt;<i> users want to be able to use PB clients from vanilla python
</I>&gt;<i> interpreters and IPython out of the box - not from within some other
</I>&gt;<i> process doing the tricks that are in conch/stdio.py.  Am I not correct
</I>&gt;<i> that threads are needed in this case?  Second, what this module does
</I>&gt;<i> is actually make the terminal asynchronous, which is exactly the
</I>&gt;<i> opposite of what these users want.  They *want* a synchronous terminal
</I>&gt;<i> and a blocking PB clients.  I hope I am not coming across as angry
</I>&gt;<i> about this - I'm not.  To me the lesson is that as long as everything
</I>&gt;<i> is really asynchronous anything is possible within the constraints of
</I>&gt;<i> this asynchronous universe.  It's the multiple universe things that
</I>&gt;<i> makes life complicated (asyn + syn).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;But, I have never seen a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;method of putting a blocking API on top of such a client that was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;_really_ thread safe.  I have seen a few approaches that seem to work,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;but that are clearly non-thread safe.  I would love to see a robust
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;solution for this problem though - one that could be fully trusted.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why isn't a solution based on Twisted's thread-safe event-posting API
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (reactor.callFromThread) and the thread-safe event-posting API of whatever
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other thing is being integrated with &quot;really&quot; thread-safe?  Sure, you can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; write programs which will deadlock as a result of application-level bugs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where one thread is blocked on a request and the other thread needs some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information from it before the request can be satisfied, but this is inherent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to wanting to drive an asynchronous API synchronously.  Aside from it, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't think there are any problems with what I described above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It probably is, but I have never seen an implementation that actually
</I>&gt;<i> does this.  Do you know of one?  The ones that I have seen - even
</I>&gt;<i> those which use callFromThread have not filled me with thoughts of
</I>&gt;<i> robustness, stability and thread safety.  I should look at this again
</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I should mention that in IPython this is not a show stopper for
</I>&gt;<i> us, but it does mean that we currently don't use PB in all of the
</I>&gt;<i> places we might otherwise.
