Fred,

To effectively achieve what you've outlined is really quite involved, and the answer to your question is heavily tied to the implementation.

You will be controlling access by clients to the internet. You will make that decision based essentially three factors:
- Client IP Address making access request.
- When the client IP address last accessed what version of the Required Reading.
- What is the current version of the Required Reading / when did it renew.

In order to provide some example code, the frame work of the implementation needs to be known.

Cheers,
Matt.
