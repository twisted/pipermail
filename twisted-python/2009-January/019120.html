<PRE>Hi, this is very interesting 
( am I currently testing out C++ web server (using boost asio) called
pion
to see if can suit my needs (it is a multi-threaded async IO generic
server and boost asio uses the best async APIs for each OS (including
kques for freebsd for example).


I looked at the example threads.cpp -- but could not figure out -- how
would it integrate with Twisted ? 

thanks

&gt;<i>     The question of whether anyone had developed a C++ implementation of
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted's Deferreds has cropped up on this list several times over the
</I>&gt;<i> last
</I>&gt;<i> few years. To date, I've unfortunately been forced to sit on an
</I>&gt;<i> implementation I developed several years ago for the Department of
</I>&gt;<i> Defense.
</I>&gt;<i> Due to some rather draconian IP &amp; security policies, it's taken an
</I>&gt;<i> exceptionally long time to get the code released. I'm happy to announce
</I>&gt;<i> though that I finally managed to obtain release authorization for it and
</I>&gt;<i> that the code now has a new home on Sourceforge.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     As C++ has differing language features, the API of the C++ deferreds
</I>&gt;<i> isn't identical to those of Twisted's but most of the key concepts mapped
</I>&gt;<i> over pretty well. Additionally, this implementation has a few design
</I>&gt;<i> extensions to facilitate the development multi-threaded C++ applications.
</I>&gt;<i> The multi-threaded aspect grew almost accidentally out of the original
</I>&gt;<i> single-threaded design but, since then, it has proven to be
</I>&gt;<i> extraordinarily
</I>&gt;<i> useful for simplifying several multi-threaded applications I've worked
</I>&gt;<i> on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The implementation of the library is, however, rather complex. In
</I>&gt;<i>     large
</I>&gt;<i> part, this is due to the effort required to work around the inherent
</I>&gt;<i> inflexibility of the C++ type system. The Function, Bind, and
</I>&gt;<i> Meta-Programming libraries found in Boost have gone a long way towards
</I>&gt;<i> simplify the implementation though (my original Loki-based attempt was
</I>&gt;<i> almost incomprehensible even to me ;-). The library is fully documented
</I>&gt;<i> though so as long as you're reasonably comfortable with C++ templates, it
</I>&gt;<i> should be understandable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     So far, the library has only been exposed to a handful of individuals
</I>&gt;<i> for review. I'd be interested to hear the comments anyone has about the
</I>&gt;<i> design and/or implementation approach. The code is available at:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>     Cheers,
