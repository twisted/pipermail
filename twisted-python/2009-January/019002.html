I don't have a whole lot to contribute here, except to encourage  
discussion of this issue. I *love* inlineCallbacks, and have found the  
availability of the technique has made me far more inclined to chose  
Twisted as the basis for applications that will require a great deal  
of serial-but-asynchronous operations.

I don't know if I've run into this particular issue, but I know that I  
have run into some error-handling issues when using inlineCallbacks  
that I wasn't able to debug in the usual ways, but I think I ended up  
just fixing the bug that I was trying to catch at the time.

My impression is that there's a reluctance to advertise  
inlineCallbacks too loudly, since using it still requires a thorough  
understanding of Deferreds and asynchronous development to be used  
effectively. New users really need to be starting with the 'old- 
fashioned-way', and even experienced users must be careful that their  
'mental model' of what the code is doing actually reflects reality...
