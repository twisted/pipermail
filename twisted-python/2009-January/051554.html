Keeping references to tracebacks still has many potential pitfalls.
It's a fundamental problem: tracebacks refer to all their frames,
which refer to all their locals; this makes it *really* easy to create
uncollectable cycles if you have any __del__ methods *anywhere*. It's
just not safe to keep the traceback reference in the general case.
Failure needs to work with arbitrary code.

&gt;<i> Originally all __getstate__ did was stringify the object's state, which is
</I>&gt;<i> probably why cleanFailure calls it directly. It looks to me like most of the
</I>&gt;<i> code from __getstate__ should really be moved into a separate method, which
</I>&gt;<i> would be called from cleanFailure as well as __getstate__.
</I>
Sure, that would be a slightly better factoring.

&gt;<i> This assumes that __getstate__ would still set c['tb'] to None, but that
</I>&gt;<i> cleanFailure would not. I'm not sure what the repercussions of this would
</I>&gt;<i> be, though. It seems the old problem with keeping references to tracebacks
</I>&gt;<i> is less of an issue now, based on this from the current Python docs:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note Beginning with Python 2.2, such cycles are automatically reclaimed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when garbage collection is enabled and they become unreachable, but it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> remains more efficient to avoid creating cycles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd appreciate any feedback.
</I>&gt;<i>
