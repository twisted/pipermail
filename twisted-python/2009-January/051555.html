&gt;<i>Keeping references to tracebacks still has many potential pitfalls.

This used to be pretty much 100% of the time, since Deferred itself used 
to have a __del__, so if you had a Deferred anywhere on the stack you 
were dead.  Nowadays it's a little better than that, but a surprising 
number of objects from elsewhere are uncollectable.
&gt;&gt;<i>Originally all __getstate__ did was stringify the object's state, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>which is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>probably why cleanFailure calls it directly. It looks to me like most 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>code from __getstate__ should really be moved into a separate method, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>would be called from cleanFailure as well as __getstate__.
</I>
Nevertheless cleanFailure will still need to remove the traceback, for 
the reasons that Chris mentioned.
&gt;<i>Sure, that would be a slightly better factoring.
</I>
Would that help, though?

I don't fully understand the issue, so this is probably wrong in some 
obvious way, but: do we really need to hang on to a real traceback 
object to resolve the issue in question?  It sounds like the real issue 
here is that we don't have a channel to communicate a &quot;cleaned 
traceback&quot; (i.e., failure with stringified frames, but no traceback) 
from one bit of code to another?
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Note Beginning with Python 2.2, such cycles are automatically 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>reclaimed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>when garbage collection is enabled and they become unreachable, but 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>remains more efficient to avoid creating cycles.
</I>
I'm not sure what Python documentation you're quoting here, but that's 
not accurate in the general case.  For example, see 
&lt;<A HREF="http://docs.python.org/library/gc.html#gc.garbage">http://docs.python.org/library/gc.html#gc.garbage</A>&gt;:

    &quot;Objects that have __del__() methods and are part of a reference 
cycle     cause the entire reference cycle to be uncollectable&quot;.
&gt;&gt;<i>I'd appreciate any feedback.
</I>
Two bits of feedback:

1. More of this discussion should be on a ticket.  The mailing list is 
good for getting discussions started and figuring out what needs to be 
done, but now we're talking about the technical specifics of resolving a 
specific problem.  Someone (terry?) should take the specifics in the 
email that started this thread and file an appropriate ticket.

2. When filing that ticket, I'd really like a full working example of 
inlineCallbacks not showing a traceback to play with, not just examples 
of portions of the problem.  The obvious example I tried,

    from twisted.internet.defer import inlineCallbacks

    def buggy2():
        raise RuntimeError(&quot;Whoops!&quot;)

    @inlineCallbacks
    def buggy():
        yield buggy2()

    buggy()

actually prints a nice descriptive traceback.
