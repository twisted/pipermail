Thanks!  We can always use help, and the 3.0 port is a major project 
which we currently have no manpower for, so we can especially use help 
for that.
&gt;<i>Is someone leading the porting process?
</I>
You, now :).
&gt;<i>Have you defined a porting strategy?
</I>
Yes.  It's outlined here:

&gt;<i>What is the best way in which I can contribute to this?

Twisted's test suite currently emits a _lot_ of warnings.  In order to 
do a python 3 port, we'll need to be getting zero warnings on python 2.6 
with the -3 switch.  If we are even going to be able to _see_ those 
warnings, we need to get down to zero warnings and adopt a zero- 
tolerance policy on new warnings being added.

So the first thing you should do is find, file, and fix as many tickets 
as you can related to warnings in tests; warnings from Twisted itself, 
warnings from the stdlib, warnings from dependencies.

When you're done with that we can talk about what comes next :).
