It is not because I believe that Canonical would deliberately do something bizarre like making their version of Twisted actually be GPL3, but rather, that they make no guarantees to this effect (nor should they have to, the patches are in their system, not ours!).

&gt;<i> To confirm, LaMont -- who submitted the patch under question into Ubuntu
</I>&gt;<i> -- did ask our team's management, and the answer was that Canonical has
</I>&gt;<i> no interest in keeping that patch from going upstream, under whatever
</I>&gt;<i> license applies to Twisted.
</I>

I'd still prefer that we just accept patches consistently through one mechanism.  Forgetting about the license question for a second, although today the review queue happens to be empty (!!!), a patch needs a champion willing to respond to review feedback almost as much as it needs to be written in the first place.  If the author doesn't have time to submit it, then it's unlikely they'll have time to respond to feedback and complete the process, which just makes more detritus in our issue tracker.
