<PRE>It seems like a lot of people have recently been having trouble with getting their comments rejected as spam.  Going through trac, I selected some random tickets and tried to re-train our bayesian filter.  In the course of doing so, I noticed that every single Conch-related ticket had a starting score of nearly 100% spam.  After repeatedly training 30 or 40 messages, it became clear that the training database was insistent upon Conch-related tokens being extremely spammy.  As a result, I've re-set the training database, which means we're starting from scratch.

Trac admins: when doing spam monitoring, remember that &quot;delete as spam&quot; means &quot;selected messages are spam&quot; and &quot;delete as ham&quot; means &quot;selected messages are NOT spam&quot;.  It seems like someone (possibly me!) accidentally flagged a whole bunch of Conch-related messages as spam, and this was causing a lot of problems.

Thanks,

-glyph
