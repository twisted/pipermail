FWIW, (sorry, non-twisted!)  if you want to avoid mongodb:

	1. We use redis for KV caching, and its really, really, really fast.
	2. Riak can use LevelDB as a backing store -- leveldb supports snappy compression on documents
	3. If you need the document search, i really like Elastic

I don't really like/trust mongodb from past experience myself.  I would normally not use it for anything other than a read-through cache... except for my current need.  We have a web spider and need to archive the snapshots.  WireTiger, which was bought by mongodb and integrated into the 3.x branch, is the only storage backend I've found that will do &quot;bucket level compression&quot;.  I forget if it's applied on pages or blocks, but it will basically apply zlib or snappy compression onto sets of documents.  I looked for weeks on something that could do that, it was the only option.  We did a lot of storage tests on our typical data, and bucketed compression saves way more space than document compression or document compression using a seed.
