Oops, I wrote my previous reply without having seen this message! :-).

And yes, I'd totally forgotten that that's a way to do it, because the documentation is horrible and it's been years since I worked on a PB-based application.  I would strongly encourage you to contribute documentation enhancements that add the requisite level of docstring coverage to PB.

Thanks for your interest so far.
