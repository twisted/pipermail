Put it into TwistedPython/doc, and if we decide we want to distribute it
separately later we can worry about it then.

There are 2 comments I'd like to make about tutorial-style documentation.

1: Try to make an example that shows how to do something *useful*.  My
&quot;cat&quot; tutorial is a gentle parody of all those other tutorials that show
you how to abstractly do an object-oriented taxonomy of a cat; I plan
(hopefully) to have lots of interesting &quot;cookbook&quot; style examples which
describe useful things that you'd probably want to do in an actual program
(like connecting your cat to the web, netnews, a twisted reality game and
a custom cat-control protocol).  I suggest that you do the same... or
perhaps even integrate with the &quot;cat&quot; theme :)

2: Take a look at WebWare.  Don't re-build any of that functionality.  I'd
really like to have WebWare be the standard way of doing DB interaction,
etc, from twisted web... I think that a twisted protocols tutorial or
something similiar would be a good idea.  Since this &quot;integration&quot; should
be trivial (I just haven't had enough time for it lately) if you find that
you need to re-build bits of webware for your tutorial try integrating it
first :-)

A TR tutorial would also be really helpful.

&gt;<i> Also, I'm using HTML because that's what all the rest of the docs are in. If
</I>&gt;<i> anyone has a suggestion for another format feel free.
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Also, I just committed my refactorings to reality, so if you're having
</I>&gt;<i> troubles blame (and email) me. :)
</I>
At this point, still very few people use reality, and I'm working on other
things, so you probably won't hear much :)
