I think something like this is definitely needed, because any timeout
anyone does with Twisted will probably be done while waiting for a
Deferred to return.

</I>&gt;<i> must happen (plus it probably means adding a &quot;timeback&quot; method, or
</I>&gt;<i> something).
</I>
I think a 'timeout' callback method or somesuch might be a good way to
do it, that way you just leave it up to the developer what to do when
something finally does callback/errback after a timeout has happened.

&gt;<i> Perhaps a TimeoutDeferred subclass?  But then it's not generally useful
</I>&gt;<i> anymore, unless a method explicitly returns TimeoutDeferred and not
</I>&gt;<i> Deferred.  Still, encouraging people to use hard-coded arbitrary
</I>&gt;<i> timeouts everywhere probably isn't a good idea either.
</I>
I don't think it really needs to be a separate class - we can just have
an 'addTimeBack' method on Deferreds that creates a Delayed (or
something?) on the Deferred with the appropriate stuff. That way the
regular case of not using a timeout on a Deferred won't have any
overhead.

&gt;<i> Thoughts, anyone?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Actual implementation details left as an exercise for the reader...
</I>&gt;<i> actually, I'm happy to do it if people want this).
</I>
I guess either a Delayed or a main.addTimeout (err, it's not called
'main.addTimeout' anymore with the new Reactor refactor, but I don't
know what it is)
