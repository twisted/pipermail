Subject: [Twisted-Python] Reality and global Thing tables
Date: Thu, 23 May 2002 18:33:32 -0400 (EDT)

&gt;<i>  From what brief conversations we've had on the topic, my understanding of
</I>&gt;<i> the situation is this:  I like to have large global tables, each for a
</I>&gt;<i> certain &quot;type&quot; of Thing, that references every instance in the game; an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative approach favored by others is for references to only those
</I>&gt;<i> objects that will be useful to be kept around locally (locally with
</I>&gt;<i> respect to the objects that will find them useful).
</I>
&gt;<i>  The main argument I've heard against global tables is they use
</I>&gt;<i> resources unnecessarily.  A game with a billion Widgets will have an
</I>&gt;<i> unreasonably large table, which must apparently be kept entirely in memory
</I>&gt;<i> (whereas, with a bit of cleverness, the Widgets themselves can be tossed
</I>&gt;<i> onto disk when not needed).  Are there other arguments against using
</I>&gt;<i> global tables?
</I>
They encourage poor programming practices.  Having coded on more than a few
games that worked this way, I can say with relative certainty that the code
begins to acquire crufty crap like 

    if self.universe.objects[util.REFRIGERATOR_PROTOTYPE_ID].model.maxTemperature &lt; 7:

, which has all kinds of unpleasant implications.  Better not to provide a hook
that encourages people to do this, or to think it's valid.

They create trouble with slow, blocking persistence systems (like an RDBMS, or
a persistence server).  This should be obvious, but it bears mentioning.  Were
you planning on keeping all your objects in memory all the time?

They create a class of problems which need to be solved with them, which
otherwise don't exist.  For example, &quot;global tell&quot;, or a system of global
&quot;guild&quot; game-objects which get referred to by all the code, rather than a
data-driven system for describing guilds that's sensibly located in a module
someplace... perhaps merely a symptom of &quot;poor programming practices&quot;, you end
up with lots of code that requires objects of specific names/IDs to exist to
work.  This creates a maintenance and set-up nightmare if people ever want to
make a derivative game with a similar world.

&gt;<i>  I don't find this to be convincing for a few reasons.  Firstly (and least
</I>&gt;<i> importantly), hardware is cheap and expanding a server to meet the needs
</I>&gt;<i> of a game isn't all that unreasonable.  Besides, I'll never have to worry
</I>&gt;<i> about it because my game will never become that large or popular ;)
</I>&gt;<i> Second, distributing references locally gives us a large performance hit
</I>&gt;<i> for certain operations.
</I>
It becomes impossible to grow the world beyond the confines of a single
machine.  And yes, this *does* happen, for games of any complexity; many
relatively popular MUDs wrestle with hardware scale issues, and I'll bet money
that a really popular one written in Python would definitely need some help in
the scalability department.  For example, the Dikumud FAQ describes the problem
of &quot;machine lag&quot;:

    <A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/games/mud-faq/diku/">http://www.faqs.org/faqs/games/mud-faq/diku/</A>

&gt;<i> Consider the common case of game-wide communication.  This can either be
</I>&gt;<i> an inherent ability (think &quot;tell&quot; from most MUDs) or something granted by
</I>&gt;<i> a device (the commlinks of SWR).  Either way brings essentially the same
</I>&gt;<i> programmatic challenges.  Determine who the message is addressed to and
</I>&gt;<i> deliver it.  Using global tables, we can look up a player name (in linear
</I>&gt;<i> time) and deliver the message or look up a &quot;device address&quot;  (cellphone
</I>&gt;<i> number, frequency ID, whatever floats your boat) and deliver the message
</I>&gt;<i> to anyone in close proximity to the Thing.
</I>
OK; I consider the &quot;common case of game-wide communication&quot; to be an issue of
its own, for several reasons:

    1) it totally breaks immersion in the world

&quot;tell&quot; is not really an interaction between simulation-domain objects, as a
message between two people.  This is better handled by having a *real*
messaging system integrated with your game, rather than a halfassed tack-on
(see (3) below)

    2) it only works with a *very* special class of objects (Players)

Players are far from &quot;common&quot;.  Having a global lookup table of all online
players has many advantages; it can be abused if you use it too frequently, and
for the wrong things (I would characterize &quot;tell&quot; as &quot;one of the wrong things&quot;,
as explained in (4)).  They also happen to have client objects attached to
them.  Are you communicating with the player or directly with his client?
Also, players have guaranteed unique names pretty much regardless of what other
rules are in your game world; they are the most important kind of Thing, they
are always unique, etc.

    3) it is hard to do right; chat is a problem all its own

On the surface of it, chat is easy.  But once you start talking about
moderation, ban lists, buddy lists, status notification, idle time... the
system can get complex really fast.  Why would you want to pollute your
game-world with all that stuff?  Leave it in the chat service, which should
work considerably differently than a virtual world sim.  Have it maintained by
chat hackers, not game hackers.  If 'tell' in-game is really important between
characters, you can use the chat library as an add-on or mix-in with a
game-based user interface, rather than as a separate service.

    4) you might want it to work between servers -- then, a global table is
       useless

This is a specific example of the general case where being able to look up an
*asynchronous reference to a uniquely named object* is really much more useful
than having a table of everything, everywhere.  The table then becomes an
implementation detail, and you can dispatch to PB's equivalent of DNS in order
to locate the object that you want to be talking to.  This is another problem
which is deceptively simple on the surface of it, but gets more complex as you
manage hierarchies of naming, etc.  This also makes it far less convenient to
just hack in a reference to a global object and makes people think about
failure conditions a bit more.

    5) it only works for people who are &quot;currently online&quot;

Or does it?  Do you have persistent messaging?  Oh ho, that there sounds like a
mail delivery system.  Now you have to interface to a *mail* system, which is
even more fun than chat.  Otherwise, a global table of persistent objects
doesn't make sense, really, 'cause you need to check if the user's online.
What should happen when these lookups fail?  Are tells in some way
transactional?  Can you tell if delivery succeeds?

&gt;<i> Contrast this with a system lacking global tables.  To determine who the
</I>&gt;<i> message is addressed to, one essentially has to walk through the graph of
</I>&gt;<i> the entire game.  Start with your highest level organizational unit
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;areas&quot; on most MUDs) and work down to rooms, then room contents
</I>&gt;<i> (including players and containers, and containers in containers, etc).  A
</I>&gt;<i> very expensive operation that could end up costing many levels of
</I>&gt;<i> recursion along with numerous unneeded levels of indirection in the form
</I>&gt;<i> of rooms and containers.  Of course, after the first lookup you can cache
</I>&gt;<i> the result (and hope it doesn't change in the mean time) obviating the
</I>&gt;<i> need for further lookups, but this comes with the problem of eventually
</I>&gt;<i> costing as much memory as the global solution (if not more) unless you do
</I>&gt;<i> cache management and culling and all sorts of other complexities.  Fun?
</I>&gt;<i> No.
</I>
OK; having an *extremely* slow API which essentially does the same thing as a
global table of references was never advocated as a good idea.  It's the idea
that you should be able to refer to every blade of grass in the world by its
name and synchronously retrieve a reference to it that I object to.  A table is
merely a side-effect of this requirement.

&gt;<i>  So, am I just missing some clever way to operate without global tables,
</I>&gt;<i> or some other disadvantage to keeping them around?  I am as an empty pot,
</I>&gt;<i> fill me up.
</I>
Make URI-based &quot;tables&quot; that refer to objects that might be local or remote,
and have a restricted set of operations that can be performed on them,
asynchronously only.

I have to get going for a dinner engagement now, but if you think I'm not
totally on crack, I can describe this in more detail later.  Send a link to
your PGP public key, while you're at it :)
