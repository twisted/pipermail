<PRE>No. (In answer to the subject.)

An idle connection is one in which is a _valid_ connection (i.e., it hasn't disconnected from the server) but hasn't sent any data for 30 seconds. The way I have initially set it up was in a thread.

That's your problem.  You may not call Twisted APIs of any kind from a thread.  That goes *double* for threads started with start_new_thread; if you start threads that way you will have problems with clean shutdown as well.  If you have work you want to do in a thread in Twisted, use reactor.callInThread.

<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.0.0/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorThreads.html#callInThread">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.0.0/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorThreads.html#callInThread</A>

If, for some reason, you needed to tell a transport to disconnect from a thread, the right way to do it would be to call reactor.callFromThread(transport.loseConnection).

<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.0.0/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorThreads.html#callFromThread">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.0.0/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorThreads.html#callFromThread</A>

However, this is still wrong, as there's no need to spin up or manage threads in order to run timed events in Twisted.

Bottom line: don't use threads.  If you think you need to in order to perform some basic task, there is probably a Twisted API you haven't learned about yet.

&gt;<i> Can anyone direct me on the proper way to kill a connection from the server end in a clean manner?
</I>
If you want to check the connection every 30 seconds, use a LoopingCall that calls your 'check' function every 30 seconds, to check the activity flag and call loseConnection if necessary.

<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.0.0/api/twisted.internet.task.LoopingCall.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.0.0/api/twisted.internet.task.LoopingCall.html</A>

You should also know that until &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/78">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/78</A>&gt; is closed, your connection won't be &quot;killed&quot; so much as it is &quot;shut down&quot;; the socket will wait until all of its remaining data has been sent (or the TCP-level timeout has passed) before closing.
