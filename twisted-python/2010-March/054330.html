</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Of these things, what are the most interesting or useful? the least?

If OpenHatch has users, the most interesting thing is simply that they will
be looking at these lists :).


&gt;<i>  * Are there other tickets from the Twisted Trac that would be good to pull
</I>
in?
&gt;<i>
</I>
For new contributors?  Not that I can think of.


&gt;<i> * Would you like me to ping the list if we come up with anything else I
</I>&gt;<i> think you might find interesting?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure.


&gt;<i> * Do any of you want to re-use some of this data -- can we make that
</I>&gt;<i> easier?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Isn't this all data that we're providing to *you*?  I don't understand why
we'd want to be pulling things back out of OpenHatch.  Perhaps I've
misunderstood.


&gt;<i> We're pretty interested in helping projects convert users to contributors
</I>&gt;<i> (in code, testing, documentation, whatever!) across free software. I
</I>&gt;<i> wonder if there is a website widget that we could make for you to put on
</I>&gt;<i> twistedmatrix.com -- a big box talking about how &quot;You TOO can contribute
</I>&gt;<i> to Twisted -- there are mentors, easy bugs, and everything!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Anything that would help us organize that information to appeal to potential
contributors would be helpful.


&gt;<i> I don't mean to barge in; let me know if I'm unwelcome, and I'll wander
</I>&gt;<i> off. I find myself in a maze of Twisted developers, none of whom are
</I>&gt;<i> alike. Thanks! I'll be hanging out on #twisted as myself, paulproteus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Please feel free to stay in touch.  Getting more people involved in Twisted
development is always of interest.
