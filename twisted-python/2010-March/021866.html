Not sure if it helps in your case, but I once made a script that produced a 
table of tickets associated with a milestone, to include with release notes. 
It needed the 1-line summary, which was not included in the CSV export. I 
thought I would have to resort to scraping the HTML, but then found that the 
RSS feed contained all the info I needed.
