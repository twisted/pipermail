<PRE>Hi everyone,

I am running a server in application context via:

# code: server.tac
factory = Factory()
factory.protocol = MyProtocol
application = service.Application(&quot;MyServer&quot;)
service = internet.TCPServer(5555, factory)
service.setServiceParent(application)
# end code

ran with

$ twistd -ny server.tac

Here is some of my Protocol code:

# code: myprotocol.py
def checkIdle(transport):
    while 1:
        now = time.time()
        if now - transport.activityFlag &gt; 30.0:
            transport.loseConnection()
            time.sleep(1)
            break
            return
        time.sleep(8)
    return

class MyProtocol(Protocol):
    def connectionMade(self):
        self.transport.activityFlag = time.time()
        thread.start_new_thread(checkIdle, (self.transport,))

    # ... the rest of the methods... not important for this question
# end code

Now here's my problem: I want to kill connections from the server that have
been idle for, say, 30 seconds. An idle connection is one in which is a
_valid_ connection (i.e., it hasn't disconnected from the server) but hasn't
sent any data for 30 seconds. The way I have initially set it up was in a
thread. I simply check the last time it had activity from that particular
transport. The really real problem I am having is when the connection is
closed, the client doesn't know about it. It is simply closed on the server
and the client is left hanging. If I test this in telnet with:

$ telnet localhost 5555

telnet never quits with a message: Connection closed by foreign host. (which
is indeed exactly what I want)
The only way I get this response is if I try to send data to the server
while the connection has been &quot;lost&quot;.

Can anyone direct me on the proper way to kill a connection from the server
end in a clean manner?

(By the way, I'm very new to twisted, not so new to Python).

Thanks for any help!
