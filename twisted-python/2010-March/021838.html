All right! (-:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
I did just notice there's a documentation tag. Is that something that 
you'd want us to pull in, too?

I imagine you'll say yes -- I'm mostly asking to get your creative juices 
flowing and see if there's anything else....

&gt;<i>       * Would you like me to ping the list if we come up with anything else I
</I>&gt;<i>       think you might find interesting?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure. &#160;
</I>
Yay.

&gt;<i>       * Do any of you want to re-use some of this data -- can we make that
</I>&gt;<i>       easier?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't this all data that we're providing to you? &#160;I don't understand why 
</I>&gt;<i> we'd want to be pulling things back out of OpenHatch. &#160;Perhaps I've

</I>
I'm mostly referring to things like jesstess's &quot;How to get involved&quot; 
answers.

One more thing -- pulling data out of Trac isn't actually super easy (-:. 
So if you want us to re-export that in some really simple format like a 
big JSON list, that's something else we can do.

&gt;<i>       We're pretty interested in helping projects convert users to contributors
</I>&gt;<i>       (in code, testing, documentation, whatever!) across free software. I
</I>&gt;<i>       wonder if there is a website widget that we could make for you to put on
</I>&gt;<i>       twistedmatrix.com -- a big box talking about how &quot;You TOO can contribute
</I>&gt;<i>       to Twisted -- there are mentors, easy bugs, and everything!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anything that would help us organize that information to appeal to 
</I>&gt;<i> potential contributors would be helpful. &#160;
</I>
Here's a dream:

A big and colorful box sits on the Twisted homepage. It says &quot;Want to help 
Twisted out, but feel shy about getting your feet wet? There are five 
mentors standing by to help you dive in, 18 easy bugs, and 25 requests for 
documentation.&quot; (Only maybe somehow it could use less words?)

That might take the person to the OpenHatch project page for Twisted, 
where all that information is listed or available a click away. The widget 
on the Twisted home page could pull data from OpenHatch's project page.

I don't know that *we* would get around to it soon, but certainly we can 
provide the data pretty quickly. We might also get around to it sometime.

In fact, I just filed a bug with the above text -- 
<A HREF="https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue35">https://openhatch.org/bugs/issue35</A>

&gt;<i>       I don't mean to barge in; let me know if I'm unwelcome, and I'll wander
</I>&gt;<i>       off. I find myself in a maze of Twisted developers, none of whom are
</I>&gt;<i>       alike. Thanks! I'll be hanging out on #twisted as myself, paulproteus.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please feel free to stay in touch. &#160;Getting more people involved in 
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted development is always of interest.&#160;
</I>
Great! (-:
