<PRE>I ran into David Reid at PyCon a few weeks ago, and I showed him an index 
of &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;bitesize&quot; bugs I'm putting on the web at 
<A HREF="https://openhatch.org/search/.">https://openhatch.org/search/.</A> He told me that the Twisted team tags bugs 
as &quot;easy&quot; in Trac.

So all you might like to see 
<A HREF="https://openhatch.org/search/?q=Twisted&amp;toughness=bitesize">https://openhatch.org/search/?q=Twisted&amp;toughness=bitesize</A> -- it's the 
result of search for bugs whose full text or project matches &quot;Twisted&quot;, 
constrained to only include the bugs that are &quot;easy&quot;. This is the same 
query as 
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;keywords=~easy&amp;order=priority">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;keywords=~easy&amp;order=priority</A> 
-- the same 18 tickets -- but cached in our index.

The OpenHatch website aims to show helpful, friendly things to potential 
new contributors. A list of bugs isn't always adequate, so I'm really 
happy jesstess wrote some tips on the OpenHatch project page regarding 
getting involved in Twisted: <A HREF="https://openhatch.org/+projects/Twisted">https://openhatch.org/+projects/Twisted</A>

The &quot;Relatedly&quot; sidebox on that project page has other helpful links: 
potential mentors, namely people who have signed into OpenHatch and said 
they can mentor in Python or Twisted.

So that's a quick tour of some of relevant things to you guys. I have a 
few questions for you guys, if you're game:

* Of these things, what are the most interesting or useful? the least?

* Are there other tickets from the Twisted Trac that would be good to pull 
in?

* Would you like me to ping the list if we come up with anything else I 
think you might find interesting?

* Do any of you want to re-use some of this data -- can we make that 
easier?

We're pretty interested in helping projects convert users to contributors 
(in code, testing, documentation, whatever!) across free software. I 
wonder if there is a website widget that we could make for you to put on 
twistedmatrix.com -- a big box talking about how &quot;You TOO can contribute 
to Twisted -- there are mentors, easy bugs, and everything!&quot;

This email has gotten fairly long, so I'll stop here for now.

I don't mean to barge in; let me know if I'm unwelcome, and I'll wander 
off. I find myself in a maze of Twisted developers, none of whom are 
alike. Thanks! I'll be hanging out on #twisted as myself, paulproteus.
