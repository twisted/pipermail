Yeah -- but (see below)

</I>
It is doing just that to find the IDs to look at.

Then it actually scrapes the Trac-rendered HTML because the CSV export (as 
far as I know) can't tell us answers to questions like, &quot;How many people 
were active on this bug?&quot; I find that's a useful thing to show off.

So it's a combination of both, and we end up with a little more data than 
the Trac API exports. I'll probably start serving out JSON dumps soon.
