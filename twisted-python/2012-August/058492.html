&gt;<i>Hello,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>(I think behavior #1 is called synchronous in most Twisted tutorials,

</I>&gt;<i>(that means request handler used defer.succeed() or somethin similar)
</I>&gt;<i>2. If False I send empty ACK, and wait for callback to send Response
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>code:

</I>&gt;<i>        if d.called is False:
</I>&gt;<i>            sendEmptyAck()
</I>&gt;<i>        d.addCallback(sendResponse)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I assume that sendResponse can send either ACK+RSP, or only RSP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I would like to ask if this is a proper approach?

This isn't the right way to go.  The `called` attribute is set to `True` 
as soon as `Deferred.callback` is called.  This might sound like it's 
what you want, but only if you disregard the chaining feature of 
Deferreds, where a callback on the Deferred might return a *new* unfired 
Deferred.  Now your original Deferred has `called` set to `True` but you 
don't actually have a result yet.

Instead, there are two obvious options:

  1. Allow the application to return a non-Deferred result.  Use 
`isinstance` to detect this case and do the synchronous send when you 
see a non-Deferred come back.  Send the empty ACK and ultimately the 
result in the other case.

  2. Change your empty ACK logic to be time-based instead.  Say, if the 
application doesn't produce a result within 10 milliseconds, send the 
empty ACK.  Implement this using `reactor.callLater` and 
`IDelayedCall.cancel`.  You'll set up a delayed call to send the empty 
ACK every time you call application code, but in the callback on the 
application's Deferred, you'll cancel that call (unless it has already 
happened).

Hope this helps,
Jean-Paul
