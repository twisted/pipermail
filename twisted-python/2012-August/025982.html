Incidentally, I think this was the problem I ran into in Foolscap,
trying to build a tool that lets you run individual shell commands
remotely. I was able to stretch the three file descriptors (stdin,
stdout, stderr) over the wire using a callRemote() for each invocation
of dataReceived(), but had similar issues when closing one side of the
connection. The easiest way to trigger this was to run /usr/bin/sort,
which necessarily waits until the input has been closed before it will
produce any output. So you run &quot;cat data.txt | flappclient run-command&quot;,
flappclient reads from StandardIO, sends the data to the far end,
notices the EOF on stdin when the data is finished, sends a &quot;stdin is
closed&quot; message to the remote side, receives the return data from sort,
then tries to write it to the local stdout (which sometimes failed).

I think I saw problems in the opposite situation too: if stdout were
closed (because our caller didn't want to hear anything further from
us), the stdin would no longer accept data. I don't remember how I
triggered this situation.

My workaround is here, in case you find it useful:

 <A HREF="https://github.com/warner/foolscap/blob/master/foolscap/appserver/client.py#L64">https://github.com/warner/foolscap/blob/master/foolscap/appserver/client.py#L64</A>

It worked for me at the time. (since then I've seen some trouble when
running git-receive-pack over this connection, which may or may not be
related, so I won't claim it's foolproof).

cheers,
 -Brian
