+1 for some guidelines from a similar policy

Note that we're actually discussing one step more extreme.  Closing poor
questions is common across SE so the issue only affects new OPs. We're
talking about a break from community norms... more like Physics deciding to
close questions after the first answer is added.

We should also consider any unintended side-effects due to Github's default
searches behavior (&quot;open&quot;):

Closing PRs will make them less likely to be found by searchers.  If every
PR has an issue (common for bug fixes, less common for new features), this
is less of a problem -- is this something the bot would need to verify/fix?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. We have a help center (like all other Stack Exchange sites) explaining
</I>&gt;<i> the rules and system. It's not great though, and its shortcomings show up
</I>&gt;<i> all the time as new users do get confused about the rules. I think if
</I>&gt;<i> anything this is just an indication that contributing guidelines need to be
</I>&gt;<i> really clear about what the various signals from the maintainers mean.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It's really helpful to leave a comment on unfit questions explaining
</I>&gt;<i> what the problem is and *how the poster can improve it*. Stack Exchange
</I>&gt;<i> has canned close reasons, but they're rarely sufficient in my opinion. I
</I>&gt;<i> leave comments like &quot;Welcome to Physics Stack Exchange! I think there's an
</I>&gt;<i> interesting question here but we have some rules...Please see the [help
</I>&gt;<i> center](link)...&quot;. Starting the comment with something positive and
</I>&gt;<i> directing the user to official guidelines seems rather helpful, although I
</I>&gt;<i> can't provide metrics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Our chat room is extremely easy to access and people there are
</I>&gt;<i> friendly. IRC is great but I just clicked around the Twisted website for a
</I>&gt;<i> minute and couldn't find any indication that the twisted IRC channel exists.
