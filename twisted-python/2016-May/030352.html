How are things currently &quot;triaged&quot;?  Do you mean &quot;review&quot;?  If so, I think it would be acceptable to come up with a magic comment for a non-commiter to use to signify that they've fully reviewed a PR.  As it stands, we need committers to &quot;accept&quot; a review by deciding to merge, the only difference here is that it would remain in the review queue until they did so, which I think is acceptable (since if the review isn't accepted, it should have remained in the queue anyway).  We could also have a bot address this edge-case somehow.

&gt;<i> - Useful search (GitHub search is kind of abysmal)
</I>
I don't see how Trac's is better.

&gt;<i> - Assigning to non-committers.
</I>
Honestly I'm not sure that the non-committer assignment part of the workflow is all that useful.  I know I hardly ever look at report 7, and I very much doubt any non-committer does :).  It's not like we're losing information, either; we still have a record of whose fork the PR points to.

&gt;<i> Without these things (and quite a few more), it's unlikely that GitHub Issues will be as useful to us.
</I>

I am curious about the &quot;quite a few more&quot;.  There are things which we really need as a critical part of our workflow (primarily: the review queue) and then there are accidents of the way trac works.  Nothing is graven in stone here :).
