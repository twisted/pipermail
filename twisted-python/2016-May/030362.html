</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry, I guess I wasn't clear.  I know that PRs are presently a potential alternative to a diff, and that we are still using Trac for ticketing.  I want to make it possible to avoid using Trac for ticketing; perhaps switching to github issues entirely.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is an optimistic idea but one that, unfortunately, won't happen yet ;)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The things GitHub Issues need to be competitive with Trac as it stands:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - Allowing triage by people without write.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How are things currently &quot;triaged&quot;?  Do you mean &quot;review&quot;?  If so, I think it would be acceptable to come up with a magic comment for a non-commiter to use to signify that they've fully reviewed a PR.  As it stands, we need committers to &quot;accept&quot; a review by deciding to merge, the only difference here is that it would remain in the review queue until they did so, which I think is acceptable (since if the review isn't accepted, it should have remained in the queue anyway).  We could also have a bot address this edge-case somehow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Creating a ticket, adding it to the relevant milestone (commit required on GitHub), setting the component (which would be a tag on github, requires commit)...
</I>
I don't see us getting a lot of non-committer triage of this kind.  And I'm not sure that's really an important part of our workflow - do you really feel that it is?  Frankly when non-committers try to put their changes into a milestone or start adding custom keywords, it's almost always wrong.

We also don't use &quot;component&quot; for much.  If we just got rid of it, would any part of our process change?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - Useful search (GitHub search is kind of abysmal)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't see how Trac's is better.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It has a GUI rather than being stringly typed ;)
</I>
Oh, you're talking about &quot;query&quot;, i.e. <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query,">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query,</A> not &quot;search&quot;, i.e. <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/search">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/search</A> ?

GitHub's search is actually structured, not stringly typed; there's a bit of GUI here: <A HREF="https://github.com/search/advanced.">https://github.com/search/advanced.</A>  It does resolve down to a string query, but so does the trac &quot;custom query&quot; eventually (in that it goes into a URL you can copy and paste).

But, this is all sort of abstract: what kinds of queries would you do against our ticket database in Trac that are not possible in GitHub's query language?  Personally after some exploration of GitHub's query language I have found it's actually more expressive for what I want to do most of the time; particularly querying across projects which is obviously not possible with trac...

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - Assigning to non-committers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Honestly I'm not sure that the non-committer assignment part of the workflow is all that useful.  I know I hardly ever look at report 7, and I very much doubt any non-committer does :).  It's not like we're losing information, either; we still have a record of whose fork the PR points to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I look at report 7 :(
</I>
That's not a counterexample: you are a committer :-).

I do actually have a recurring personal to-do item to check report 7 nowadays, but almost all of my doing-stuff-on-the-tracker has to do with me getting emails about actionable state changes (somebody reviewed your change, you should merge it), rather than scanning that list.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Without these things (and quite a few more), it's unlikely that GitHub Issues will be as useful to us.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am curious about the &quot;quite a few more&quot;.  There are things which we really need as a critical part of our workflow (primarily: the review queue) and then there are accidents of the way trac works.  Nothing is graven in stone here :).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess there's a lot of things that are an accident of trac, but the things above are useful.
</I>
I'm not disputing that, but I'm still a little confused about how exactly they're useful, rather than just different.  Can you give some examples of things you do regularly?
