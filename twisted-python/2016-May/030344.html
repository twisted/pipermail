<PRE>Dear all,

While I'm just a lurker, having used Twisted and Github for some time in a
moderately sized team I would like to offer a couple comments:

&gt;<i> This is exactly why issues and PRs should be separated.  If you only have
</I>one
&gt;<i> artifact - the PR - to represent both the issue and the potential
</I>solution, then
&gt;<i> you can't get rid of the potential solution (reject the PR) without also
</I>getting rid
&gt;<i> of the description of the problem.  Github already automatically shows
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere that your PR or issue is mentioned, so all you need to do to say
</I>&quot;how
&gt;<i> about this approach&quot; is to put the words &quot;fixes #NNN&quot; in your PR
</I>description.
&gt;<i> As a bonus, that will make it automatically close the issue when the PR is
</I>&gt;<i> merged.
</I>&#8203;
I cannot agree with this enough.

&gt;<i> One of the things I still don't like about github is the tendency for
</I>projects to build
&gt;<i> up huge piles of open PRs, which nobody wants to reject because they're
</I>maybe
&gt;<i> possibly useful, but they won't accept because they don't meet quality
</I>standards.

This is a real problem for my team, and I think it happens because we don't
respect the value of issues enough. We have two kinds of branches

1) Those which associate to a specific issue. If issue #123 is about fixing
the quizzwopper, you can make a branch called 123-fix-quizzwopper. This is
a Good Thing.

2) Those which associate to a person. We name these things like
u/danielsank/fix-quizzwopper. The point of that originally was to make
things more &quot;lightweight&quot; and &quot;dynamic&quot; by allowing folks to make a branch
and write some code asap. While this does often work, it also means that we
have a mountain of near unidentifiable branches with no obvious place to
look for that branch's motivation/history/status/whatever.

Type 1 branches have the extra advantage that they're more likely to
attract useful input from people at the right time, i.e. before the code is
written. It's very frustrating to have a PR representing many hours of
someone's work come in only to realize that you want to respond with &quot;Oh
for the love of all that is good in this world please don't do that&quot;.
Discussion in an issue helps avoid that.

&gt;<i> Contributors don't get clear feedback about whether they're expected to
</I>do more
&gt;<i> or whether the project will take it over, and people frequently get mad
</I>about their
&gt;<i> stuff not being merged.  I think by closing PRs that we aren't going to
</I>merge as-is
&gt;<i> we can send a much clearer signal about what the project is taking on
</I>versus
&gt;<i> what it expects external contributors to do more work on.
</I>
Again, agreed.

&gt;<i> One thing that pull requests encourage is discussion
</I>
It's better for that to happen in issues. I have written code, submitted it
as a PR, realized (via feedback and otherwise) that the code is total crap,
deleted the branch and closed the PR, and then gone back to the issue to
re-evaluate my life choices. This is really useful.
