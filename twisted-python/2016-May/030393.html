</I>
In terms of &quot;git flow&quot; i didn't mean the exact names, just the concept that every fix has it's own dedicated branch. This is something that almost every github-experienced person does automatically (and all current twisted PRs do).  People with less experience on github itself (not a given package) will often just edit the &quot;master&quot; branch and submit.  then they'll forget they did that and edit something else... because of that github peculiarity, and that everything is acting &quot;centralized&quot; on github and not under a &quot;decentralized&quot; model where a particular commit was queued that ends up in the review.  those types of changes can also end up triggering CI tests, which complicates things further.

twisted contributors are likely a bit more experienced and it's a self-selecting pool... i've just seen an increasing number of projects require a dedicated branch and politely reject + ask for anything against 'master' to be resubmitted via a dedicated branch.

&gt;<i> I don't see how it's incompatible.  It seems perfectly fine, as long as we shift from 'review queue == report 25' to 'review queue == open PRs with non-failing status'.
</I>
ah, I did not know that was possible.  this ties into me not understanding the content of the queue being PR only (not &quot;all tickets&quot;).

&gt;&gt;<i> At least on the github side, using some sort of label to state where in the process (ie, what type of review) something is under would help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you mean it &quot;would help&quot;?  What problem would it solve?
</I>
This would help non-maintainers understand what that actual progress was in that 5 stage review.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The caveat is that this breaks the current use of Issue as a &quot;queue&quot; item.  But Twisted is using &quot;issues&quot; less as an Issue and more as a queue item, while github &quot;Issues&quot; are less of a queue item and amore of an actual issue.  This is a bit confusing and different to how many people will use github.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know where you're getting this from.  Only tickets in review are queue items.  I have no idea what &quot;actual issue&quot; means here.
</I>
Ok. From here to the end I believe I understand my confusion.  The &quot;queue&quot; looked to me like it was &quot;All Trac Tickets&quot; not just &quot;Certain types of Trac Tickets&quot;.   I was looking at a few reports and some raw views that showed track tickets that were both bug reports and attempts to fix a specific problem.  It looked like the normal use of github would have run antagonistic to your workflow , but his all seems fine now.

&gt;<i> The practical issue I'm trying to address by switching to github PRs as opposed to trac tickets with the 'review' keyword is the speed and ease of submitting a change and getting CI feedback on that change, in addition to lowering training overhead since many people are familiar with github.  Faster feedback = happier contributors = more maintenance effort productively expended.  The issue I'm trying to address with the slightly odd close-a-PR-to-signify-finished-review workflow is to avoid the common problem of reviewers not knowing which things to review and therefore leaving certain contributions mouldering until their submitters lose interest.  Beyond that, I don't see that we have substantial workflow issues that need solving.
</I>
I was mostly concerned with the proposed implementation creating workflow issues.
