</I>&gt;<i> Hello all, my first post here - only been using Twisted for about a
</I>&gt;<i> month and am also a relative newcomer to Python but have been coding
</I>&gt;<i> professionally for 20+ years. I was attracted to Twisted and Python
</I>&gt;<i> for a particular project purely because after research it seemed to be
</I>&gt;<i> the best tool for the job, and have actually been enjoying both Python
</I>&gt;<i> and Twisted much more than I ever thought I would.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The project I am coding towards is creating a sensor data collection
</I>&gt;<i> gateway. First iteration needs are simply pulling data from ModBus TCP
</I>&gt;<i> slave PLCs and writing it to a MySQL database, but goals beyond that
</I>&gt;<i> are making the source of the data and its destination(s) very
</I>&gt;<i> flexible(pluggable). Therefore I am trying to create a good clean
</I>&gt;<i> architecture from the outset so as I iterate forwards I don't finish
</I>&gt;<i> up having to take too many steps backwards before heading forwards.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am using pymodbus to pull the data which works well for my devices,
</I>&gt;<i> has a twisted async API, and have created more than a few prototypes
</I>&gt;<i> that demonstrate all works as I expect. Where I am a bit stalled is
</I>&gt;<i> getting to grips with a good architecture that fulfills my needs - my
</I>&gt;<i> intention is that the application that meets my first goal will be a
</I>&gt;<i> twistd plugin.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The new ClientService class seems like it will fit my needs very
</I>&gt;<i> closely but I am struggling with how to handle the reconnections... I
</I>&gt;<i> have been using the whenConnected() method to grab the Protocol for
</I>&gt;<i> the initial connection and then use a method of this to poll the
</I>&gt;<i> connected slave. When the connection is lost I get an errback from
</I>&gt;<i> this method's deferred which I use as a signal to abandon the Protocol
</I>&gt;<i> and call whenConnected() again... at this point I have an issue though
</I>&gt;<i> as the returned deferred immediately gives me a callback with the same
</I>&gt;<i> Protocol which has just lost its connection, and thus loop...
</I>
If you want a hook each time a new protocol is created, you're probably better off writing a wrapper protocol factory, and passing that to your ClientService, then doing any set-up work you want to do in your buildProtocol implementation, which delegates to the real, pymodbus implementation.

&gt;<i> Before I got on this mailing list I posted this Q to stackoverflow
</I>&gt;<i> with some example code:
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/q/37061807/3448214">http://stackoverflow.com/q/37061807/3448214</A>
</I>&gt;<i> but no solution or much attention there yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I say there, I realize I have probably just made a bad pattern
</I>&gt;<i> choice for how to use this API, but I have not been able to work out a
</I>&gt;<i> better choice which seems clean and fits my needs/understanding well.
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried deriving my own Protocol/Factory and handling the polling
</I>&gt;<i> there but this seems to get really messy once I start to add code to
</I>&gt;<i> get the collected data to a destination at that level, involving
</I>&gt;<i> giving the Protocol too much knowledge of how the data is to be
</I>&gt;<i> handled.
</I>
I am curious as to why you say that this is &quot;messy&quot;.

&gt;<i> Any advice, good patterns, or pointers to other projects which do
</I>&gt;<i> something similar is appreciated,
</I>
I spent a while thinking about your question, and I'm sorry that I can't give a more thorough answer, but I think you need to be a bit more specific about what it is you don't like about your potential solution.  It seems to me that having a delegating Factory, especially if all you need to do is set up some state on each Protocol that gets produced, should be sufficient...
