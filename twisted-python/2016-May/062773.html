Sure, this makes sense.

You shouldn't need monkey patching; the standard library logger does have facilities for setting up custom handlers.  We just need to make one.  Honestly it would be great if this were featured within Twisted itself; it would make a great contribution to twisted.logger proper.

&gt;<i> The reverse mechanism of sending twisted.logger's output to the

I would very much like to see this :).  The standard library logging mechanism is in common use, and until we can spin it out into a separate project, `twisted.loggerÂ´ is unlikely to

</I>
No, there's nothing that would make it impossible.  If you want to contribute it.

&gt;<i> I do appreciate that twisted.logger offers a more feature rich

</I>&gt;<i> log messages from used modules in my mind.
</I>
I think you might even be able to claw back some structured information out of the stdlib logging machinery?  LogRecord does have 'args' and 'msg', and we could convert that into a twisted.logger format string.  This would be more expensive than using twisted.logger directly of course, but it would still provide a lot more useful information.

&gt;<i> If anyone can enlighten me I would be most appreciative,
</I>
I think just try to write a Handler (&lt;<A HREF="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/logging.handlers.html#module-logging.handlers">https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/logging.handlers.html#module-logging.handlers</A>&gt;) that converts LogRecord objects to event dictionaries, and then emit them to a &lt;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/16.1.1/api/twisted.logger.ILogObserver.html">https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/16.1.1/api/twisted.logger.ILogObserver.html</A>&gt; and let us know if you hit any problems.
