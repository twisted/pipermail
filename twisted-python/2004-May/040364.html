Good point.  I validate data players send before inserting them into Game
state, and toss them a remote exception if they don't validate.  This is
mostly for testing purposes, but should catch this kind of abuse as well.

Indeed I know someone who's dealing with just such a bug right now!  I am
fervently greatfull that Twisted exists, and I don't have to muck with such
low level headaches. :-)

&gt;<i> They can also send nasty circular structures which will put a lot of

Hmmm, I hadn't considered such a malicious denial of service style attack.
If I get to the point where such a thing could really be a problem I'll
consider myself beyond lucky!

&gt;<i> &gt; What's in newpb anyway?  I'd thought this was essentially handled with all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Avatar/Mind/Realm newcred stuff?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's authentication.  Very different from security :).
</I>
Right, although it did change pb a bit too.  More security would be great,
as I have to admit I'm mostly ignoring the issue and crossing my fingers
that Twisted deals with it well.  Just not enough energy to do everything.
