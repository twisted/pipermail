Hello Twisted folks!

The Seattle Python Interest Group (SeaPIG) is hosting a small sprint next month. I've included the full announcement below, but I wanted to send a note here to mention that we're definately going to have a group of people interested in learning Twisted, all of them (so far) being completely new to Twisted. So, if anyone is in the area, please join us! 

We'd especially love to see someone with a bit (or a lot) of Twisted experience, who'd be willing to coach us a bit. And, we'd love to see more new people to help us learn as well!

Take care,
-Brian

=============================================


SeaPIG (the Seattle Python Interest Group) is excited to announce the

                  NORTHWEST PYTHON SPRINT
                     June 19-20, 2004
                 Bellevue, Washington, USA

The cost is free thanks to our host Construx Software.  There will be a
large, comfortable room seating 50+ people at tables, wireless and wired
Internet access, and a projector for demonstrations.  We're currently
looking for coaches to lead sprints, as well as a count of the number
who might attend.  The main day is Saturday (9am-5pm), but we've also
reserved the room for Sunday in case people want more time.  There will
also be a time Saturday morning for lightning talks and demonstrations
(both non-commercial and commercial).

What is a sprint?  A sprint is a group of people who gather for a day or
more to work on a common software project.  The members choose
individual tasks and usually work solo or in pairs in the same room,
then get together periodically to compare notes.  We'll follow the model
that has worked successfully at the past several Python conferences:
several groups working on different projects in the same room.  Past
sprints have done development work on the Python core, Twisted,
Docutils, Webware, Zope, Chandler, etc.  Most projects have a variety of
tasks that need to be done -- coding modules, designing test suites,
squashing bugs, writing user documentation and developer documentation,
brainstorming design strategies, planning promotional activities, etc --
so there's something for every skill level.  You'll need to bring a
laptop, or if you don't have one you can pair with somebody who does.

So far there's one sprint scheduled, on Twisted.  A few Twisted newbies
will be writing an application to get their heads around this
asynchronous beast.  (We could really use somebody with more expertise
around, hint, hint.)

If you'd like to coach a sprint, sign up to attend,  propose a lightning
talk or demonstration, or just get more information, see our wiki page:
