I'd like to repeat what Glyph said.  This is great feedback, I'd love to =

see more of it :)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is what I came up with:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> from twisted.internet import reactor, protocol
</I>&gt;<i> from twisted.protocols import imap4
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> class MyIMAP4Client(imap4.IMAP4Client):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    def connectionMade(self):
</I>&gt;<i>        imap4.IMAP4Client.connectionMade(self)
</I>&gt;<i>        print &quot;connectionMade&quot;
</I>
  The above works (as you noticed ;) but isn't quite as good as hooking =

into the &quot;serverGreeting&quot; method, which is called after the IMAP4 server =

sends its initial message (I realize this isn't well documented).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that this is *not* a method of the MyIMAP4Client class. But it
</I>&gt;<i> worked! I got this printed to the console:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> connectionMade
</I>&gt;<i> loginCallback: ([], 'OK LOGIN Ok.')
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know, however, what the tuple represents. What's that empty
</I>&gt;<i> list? In a perfect world, would this be explained in the IMAP4Client
</I>&gt;<i> documentation? (I'm assuming that every callback would be different.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>  The callback value here is something of an implementation detail.  =

Deferreds (somewhat informally) often fall into one of two categories: =

those which will eventually be called back with an interesting value =

which is necessary for further computations, and those which will =

eventually be called back with a not-so-interesting value which only =

serves to indicate that the desired operation has completed.  login() =

falls into the second category.

&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Am I correct in assuming that the IMAP4Client documentation needs some
</I>&gt;<i> buffing up? (Maybe I can help with that.) I didn't look at any source
</I>&gt;<i> code (other than in the HOWTOs) in implementing this so I think that's
</I>&gt;<i> a good sign. But as I mentioned above, I'm not clear on how I know
</I>&gt;<i> what the signature for my callbacks should be or what the parameters
</I>&gt;<i> to those callbacks mean in some cases.
</I>
  Yep.  More documentation would be great.  The actual signature for =

callbacks is easy.  It's always a callable that takes one argument (by =

the way, this is why your code worked with both free functions and =

methods - it doesn't matter what kind of callable you use, as long as it =

takes one argument).  Further documentation about the specifics of what =

that one parameter means is definitely needed, though.
