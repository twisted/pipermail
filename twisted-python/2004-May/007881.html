Bill,

I appreciate your questions on these shutdown issues, since I think we
do still have a few semantic issues to nail down regarding startup and
shutdown.  However, I do think it's worth mentioning that you should
never depend too heavily on shutdown code if you are interested in
reliability: servers do crash, and machines do lose power, so a &quot;clean&quot;
shutdown should always be a convenience and not a necessity.

(A more serious issue that we need to address is making sure that you
can _attempt_ to bring up a new service inside an already running
reactor, fail to bring it up, and not interrupt existing,
already-running services or alter their state in some way; or, that you
can bring it up and bring it down with the same results.)
