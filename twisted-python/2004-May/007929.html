No, it does not depend on or otherwise use Stackless as far as I have 
heard.  I believe you have misread.

Well unix pipes are awful to use directly, since they are just one big 
stream of bytes with no semantic information whatsoever.. but they are 
a good enough foundation to build something better.

</I>
There isn't a whole lot of documentation.  Download it, compile it (if 
necessary, I think there are recent win32 binaries), look at some of 
the tests and code.  The stackless module has decent doc strings.

&gt;<i> Anyway, I've picked my horse--Medusa--and I had

</I>
Do you really care what the rest of the world is doing or is ready for? 
  If you really did, you'd probably be doing something in Java or C#.

&gt;<i> (It really wouldn't take much to get me over there,
</I>&gt;<i> but I really really need a lot of what's already
</I>&gt;<i> part of Twisted!)
</I>
Stackless Python is an alternative Python interpreter, not a networking 
framework.  Twisted works just fine under Stackless, and there is even 
from Stackless specific integration in the sandbox.
