Ah! This makes perfect sense to me. So I can think of overridable 
methods as events that didn't require any action on my part to fire.

However, the ircLogBot example [1], implies that calling self.join will 
eventually invoke self.joined as if self.joined was the permanent 
callback for calling self.join. I like your explanation for the 
distinction between deferreds and methods but this seems to be blurring 
the two. What happens if an error occurred while trying to join a 
channel? (I'm not trying to pick anybody--I'm just trying to make sense 
of the examples that I'm seeing.)
