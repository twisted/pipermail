The decision to drop it had not been made. I'd been meaning to talk to
exarkun about why the buildslave was removed, but haven't yet had the
chance (and remembered to discuss it). I was not planning on doing the
release requiring 2.3 without first asking the community, so your
objection to it being dropped with no discussion is slightly off.

As others have pointed out, this discussion makes it clear that the
next release of Twisted (2.1) should still support 2.2, but I strongly
suggest  we drop it immediately after that release, allowing 2.3-using
code into trunk.

The policy regarding Python release support has always been based on
Debian stable releases, since it's such a conservative milestone.
Debian has had 2.3 as its primary Python in stable for months, so it's
time.
