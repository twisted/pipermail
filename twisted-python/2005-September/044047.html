vfs is unreleased.  I think it's pretty safe to say it should stay that 
way at least until web2 is released.

vfs' APIs are obscenely unstable.

&gt;<i>    * vfs is more generally applicable than web2    
</I>
as is web2's stream.  As James pointed hopefully stream will eventually 
move into twisted core.

 &gt;    * web2's stream abstraction is not generally agreed upon

fair point.  but this just means as stream's abstraction is reworked to 
meet general consensus - vfs will need to be rewritten to meet the changes.

 &gt;  If you like, we can talk more about how this interface should work.
 &gt; However, my first inclination is to say that it should use the existing
 &gt; producer/consumer APIs.

It would be fairly straight forward to add an adapter from ivfs to 
producer/consumers if someone has a need for it.

I personally was keen to use streams with vfs as, being new project that 
has the luxury of being unstable, I wanted to pitch at were twisted was 
heading.  I was also hoping to add to web2's momentum - nevow on web2 
still feels a long way off and its something I'd really like to see.

Andy.
