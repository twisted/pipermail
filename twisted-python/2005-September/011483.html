</I>&gt;<i>I didn't expect that one must handle control codes (your function reponseFunct), I expected the protocol to handle that for me, but anyway, that was no problem (i.e. you solved it before). And with your code I could even switch off the echo (your next thread).
</I>
You don't actually have to do this.  You can implement iac_DO, iac_DONT, iac_WILL, and iac_WONT to handle feature negotiation.

You can also use twisted.conch.telnet, which presents a slightly more complete API for feature negotiation.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What I don't understand is how to 'inject' some commands and collect their result.
</I>&gt;<i>What you tried in your &quot;command&quot; function in __main__ can't work, because the protocol has no transport.
</I>&gt;<i>I don't understand how to get at the Factory's actual protocol instance and its transport.
</I>
Factory's don't have protocol instances, in general.  A factory is responsible for creating between zero and an unlimited number of instances of a protocol, as they are demanded by established connections.

Protocol.connectionMade is provided as a hook for application-level logic.  You may want to send your commands from that method.  When it is invoked, you will have a transport.
