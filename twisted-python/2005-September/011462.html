Woohoo!

&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, PB (de)serialization seems to be where I get responsiveness

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm loath to do).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;shunting all networking into a separate thread&quot; will certainly not

</I>&gt;<i> you can rest easy in the knowledge that what you want to do is not 
</I>&gt;<i> only disgusting, it's impossible :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, the problem here is that certain code in Twisted is not as 
</I>&gt;<i> awesome as it possibly could be.  While I agree this is sad, there 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't really a solution, except &quot;make it more awesome&quot;, which takes 
</I>&gt;<i> time, money, and effort, which nobody is contributing beyond an 
</I>&gt;<i> individual scale.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PB has been effectively unmaintained for almost 2 years now.  It is 
</I>&gt;<i> showing its age.  NewPB will fix several issues, but until someone 
</I>&gt;<i> wants to give Mr. Warner a staff and a budget for improving it, it's 
</I>&gt;<i> likely that it will have some ugly spots too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, you don't have to maintain your own version.  You just 
</I>&gt;<i> have to maintain the one in Twisted ;-).
</I>

I had thought about this, but I'm pretty strapped for time as my startup 
is self funded.  Plus, it's not exactly like I can just walk into your 
SVN repository and start hacking. ;-)

On the other hand, for all the free mileage I've gotten out of Twisted I 
do owe you guys a certain debt!  Perhaps I could help out on NewPB, 
especially since I could really use the Slicer code Brian was talking 
about.  However, I'm in a bit of an awkward spot to do so right now 
though, as I'm not yet using Twisted 2.0 and my project isn't at a good 
point to upgrade libaries.  Still, I've got to upgrade sometime...

Is there a good place to read more about NewPB?  Or is it just a matter 
of searching the maillist archives and SVN repository?
