I think the main reason they've won out till now is that its incrediably 
easy to implement for backend implementors, and being so primitive, 
extremely easy to compose into higher abstractions (streams, 
producers/consumers or a convenience that lets you write large amounts 
of data to a file simply) through the use of adaptors.

the ftp adaptor making using of the stream adaptor is a pretty good 
example of this.

I think the vfs stuff would really benefit by being prodded and exposed 
to as many use cases as possible.  It's been doing what I need it do for 
  around 6 months (except for dav - dav'd be awesome!:)) so it's hard to 
find motivation to work on it.

But I appreciate where your coming from.  I taken out the dav adaptor 
which was a failed experiment from the first sprint.  I think the only
controversial dependency left is web2, which I've discussed in another mail.

Andy.
