<PRE>&gt;<i>Please look at my posts from 11.08.2005 - What is wrong with this

</I>&gt;<i>remember what was wrong, but i solve most of problems, so if 
</I>&gt;<i>you had any
</I>&gt;<i>questions e-mail me. I think that my code is what You need. This is a

I played around with your code at <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2005-August/011115.html,">http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2005-August/011115.html,</A> even if I don't understand polish. ;-)

I didn't expect that one must handle control codes (your function reponseFunct), I expected the protocol to handle that for me, but anyway, that was no problem (i.e. you solved it before). And with your code I could even switch off the echo (your next thread).

What I don't understand is how to 'inject' some commands and collect their result.
What you tried in your &quot;command&quot; function in __main__ can't work, because the protocol has no transport.
I don't understand how to get at the Factory's actual protocol instance and its transport.

I could 'hardcode' a list of commands in my protocol class, but that would make no sense...

Probably I shouldn't use a ClientFactory but something else.
