<PRE>Hi,

I am beginning to use twisted.application, mktap and
twistd in my project, and I have some questions about
their use:

1. It seems that mktap is aimed primarily to create
applications containing just one service (since to
append a service to an application you need a separate
invocation of mktap). I am thinking to use it mostly
to combine services and I wonder if I'm
misunderstanding something or if I should use
MultiService or what.

Specifically, I want to have numerous services that
are (modified) PB client/servers, and when several
such services are at the same process, I want them all
to use the same ServerFactory. What I did was to make
one mktap plugin for the &quot;base server&quot;, and several
plugins for the services themselves. These services
require that the application also contains a &quot;base
server&quot;, and they bind to it automatically. This
requires creating an application with only the &quot;base
server&quot;, and then adding to it the different
subsidiary services. Any ideas on how to do this
optimally?

2. Tap conventions: it is not very clear how to make
the best use of mktap in terms of code organization.
It seems that to make plugins I need to have a
twisted/plugins folder in my application's root
directory. In twisted, this folder contains files
named twisted_*.py, I'm not sure why this naming
convention. The files in this directory point to tap
construction modules. These modules seem to be either
in twisted/tap or in twisted/*something*, in which
case they are called either tap.py or
*something*_tap.py. Additionally, the services these
modules use come from a variety of places in which I
couldn't find coherence.

So, my question is, where should I put the mktap
plugins, the tap construction modules, and the service
implementations so that it makes sense? Am I missing
anything?

2. I understand that application is meant to hold the
services' configuration. However, there are many kinds
of configurations, and I'm struggling to make a
distinction between options that are suitable for the
mktap command line, for xml-serialized applications,
and for other mechanisms, such as a human-readable
configuration file suitable for an innocent end-user.
For example, an ini file could be used to specify the
skin of a GUI application, and debugging options, but
what is more suitable for the mktap command line?
Maybe only options that somehow affect the basic
&quot;type&quot; of the service?

Thanks,

Antony Kummel
