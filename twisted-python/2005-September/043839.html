&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am beginning to use twisted.application, mktap and
</I>&gt;<i>twistd in my project, and I have some questions about
</I>&gt;<i>their use:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You may want to start out using TAC files, rather than TAP files.  TAC files are easier to manipulate, which is a plus during development.  TAP files will let you solidify whatever configuration you decide upon and expose it via the `mktap' command line.

&gt;<i>1. It seems that mktap is aimed primarily to create
</I>&gt;<i>applications containing just one service (since to
</I>&gt;<i>append a service to an application you need a separate
</I>&gt;<i>invocation of mktap). I am thinking to use it mostly
</I>&gt;<i>to combine services and I wonder if I'm
</I>&gt;<i>misunderstanding something or if I should use
</I>&gt;<i>MultiService or what.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Specifically, I want to have numerous services that
</I>&gt;<i>are (modified) PB client/servers, and when several
</I>&gt;<i>such services are at the same process, I want them all
</I>&gt;<i>to use the same ServerFactory. What I did was to make
</I>&gt;<i>one mktap plugin for the &quot;base server&quot;, and several
</I>&gt;<i>plugins for the services themselves. These services
</I>&gt;<i>require that the application also contains a &quot;base
</I>&gt;<i>server&quot;, and they bind to it automatically. This
</I>&gt;<i>requires creating an application with only the &quot;base
</I>&gt;<i>server&quot;, and then adding to it the different
</I>&gt;<i>subsidiary services. Any ideas on how to do this
</I>&gt;<i>optimally?
</I>
Each service appended to a TAP will have a reference to the parent service, which in turn has references to all its children.  By searching this graph, services can find other services that have been configured independently.  A good way to do this is usually by interface.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2. Tap conventions: it is not very clear how to make
</I>&gt;<i>the best use of mktap in terms of code organization.
</I>&gt;<i>It seems that to make plugins I need to have a
</I>&gt;<i>twisted/plugins folder in my application's root
</I>&gt;<i>directory. In twisted, this folder contains files
</I>&gt;<i>named twisted_*.py, I'm not sure why this naming
</I>&gt;<i>convention. The files in this directory point to tap
</I>&gt;<i>construction modules. These modules seem to be either
</I>&gt;<i>in twisted/tap or in twisted/*something*, in which
</I>&gt;<i>case they are called either tap.py or
</I>&gt;<i>*something*_tap.py. Additionally, the services these
</I>&gt;<i>modules use come from a variety of places in which I
</I>&gt;<i>couldn't find coherence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So, my question is, where should I put the mktap
</I>&gt;<i>plugins, the tap construction modules, and the service
</I>&gt;<i>implementations so that it makes sense? Am I missing
</I>&gt;<i>anything?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
For mktap to find your TAP plugin, it must be in twisted/plugins/.  Beyond that, Twisted doesn't care how you organize things.  As a convention, Twisted uses the twisted_ prefix so as to reduce the chance of colliding with other plugins.  If you want to be nice, you should probably adopt a similar prefix for your plugins.

The modules implementing the TAP plugins can go anywhere importable.  If it helps you decide at all, the twisted/tap/ package is generally considered to have been a mistake, and those modules have been gradually moving out to twisted/project/tap.py files.

&gt;<i>2. I understand that application is meant to hold the
</I>&gt;<i>services' configuration. However, there are many kinds
</I>&gt;<i>of configurations, and I'm struggling to make a
</I>&gt;<i>distinction between options that are suitable for the
</I>&gt;<i>mktap command line, for xml-serialized applications,
</I>&gt;<i>and for other mechanisms, such as a human-readable
</I>&gt;<i>configuration file suitable for an innocent end-user.
</I>&gt;<i>For example, an ini file could be used to specify the
</I>&gt;<i>skin of a GUI application, and debugging options, but
</I>&gt;<i>what is more suitable for the mktap command line?
</I>&gt;<i>Maybe only options that somehow affect the basic
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;type&quot; of the service?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is a pretty broad question.  I don't know that I have any particular insight into it.  Pretty much every program, whether it uses Twisted or Python or not, has to make a decision here.
