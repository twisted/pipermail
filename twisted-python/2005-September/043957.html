I don't see your point Antoine.
Chris was pointing out that in an asynchronous model your event
handlers should not block. This means that if the task you're
performing - say round tripping a packet - is gonna take 100ms,
instead of waiting for it to complete - as you would in a synchronous
model - you're gonna break it up into, say, &quot;initiation&quot; and
&quot;completion&quot; phases. So your handler will only block for the duration
of the initiation phase, that will supposedly last a lot less that
100ms, maybe not more than 1ms, and return a deferred. Then the event
loop will go off and do other stuff. After 100 ms the deferred will
fire and some other part of your code will be called and perform the
completion phase.

So, if you do as you should, GUI responsiveness will not have anything
to deal with the actual round trip times of your protocol messages.

The problem with responsiveness will come up _only_ if for some reason
you have handlers that take a lot of time to run. For example if they
do complex computation or synchronous IO of large files, and stuff
like this.
