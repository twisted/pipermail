Heh, want to hear a funny thing? That's what my current code already did :-) I 
was porting this chunk of code from Web2 to Web and while re-reading the cred 
documentation, I noticed that little bit about returning a string. So, if 
it's kosher to use the avatarId in some other way, I'm happy not having to 
tinker with minds.

I'm probably wrong, but if I had to wrap a mind-aware portal (as it's the case 
of PB), I think I would have trouble with it. Anyway, I'm a PB noob, so I'm 
sure I'm mistaken.

</I>
:<i>-)
</I>
However, I still think it's a problem (although I must agree that it would 
probably be rarely used), since the only way to create a mind is to override 
the entire method, which is a bit cumbersome. But, as you said, minds are so 
obscure, that probably nobody would ever notice it.

Cheers.
