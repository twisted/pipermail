</I>&gt;<i>Checker#requestAvatarId), a mind and a bunch of interfaces, but the realm
</I>&gt;<i>doesn't have any other information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What our checker does to authenticate an user, is to call a method on a remote

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>We're using Twisted.web only as a front end to a remote service, and we'd like

</I>
What if you use the token as the avatarId?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I tried to mimic PB's behaviour, in the sense that (as the cred documentation
</I>&gt;<i>puts out):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;it is an object which serves an important role - any notifications which are
</I>&gt;<i>to be relayed to an authenticated client are passed through a 'mind'. In
</I>&gt;<i>addition, it allows passing more information to the realm during login in
</I>&gt;<i>addition to the avatar ID.&quot;
</I>
This is technically true but as far as I know no one has ever actually used
it that way.  I'm trying to think of an authentication scheme which would
benefit from it (let alone require it), but I'm drawing a blank.  PB just
has enough expressive power already to really need this.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Actually, our resources are pretty dumb, as they only issue remote calls to an
</I>&gt;<i>external service and don't hold any information. And, since our realm can't
</I>&gt;<i>figure out whether a user can issue a particular call or not without actually
</I>&gt;<i>sending a token to the remote service, a mind object seemed the right place
</I>&gt;<i>to me... but I'd happy to be wrong :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anyway, sorry if I sound as if I'm trying to get a positive opinion for a
</I>&gt;<i>decision we already made :-P it's just that I don't see how the other options
</I>&gt;<i>would completely fit our architecture (which could be broken in the first
</I>&gt;<i>case, of course).
</I>
No problem.  Hope this has helped in some way, at least.
