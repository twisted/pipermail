<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for this insightful comments on Sqlalchmy and Twisted.


I hope I had read your mail before I start my current project.

At that time, I simply thought using deferToThread would solve
everything since the twisted.enterprise.adbapi simply use
threads.deferToThreadPool
to make database interface asynchronous.

Today, I suddenly feel that, as sqlalchemy is not thread safe, using
deferToThread might cause unexpected problems.
And I found this mail and it seems that all the code I wrote this week is
going to be useless.

But, I got another question:

Since adbapi uses deferToThreadPool to make db api asynchronous, does this
mean that all python db apis are *thread safe*?

BTW: what does 'query generator' means?  Is it a software genrating SQLs?

</I>&gt;<i> I've long worked on trying to integrate sqlalchemy and twisted in a

</I>&gt;<i> are countless reasons behind this limitation, like the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> sqlalchemy objects can do a lot of stuff behind the scenes or because
</I>&gt;<i> code that you write in other places might use some assumptions because
</I>&gt;<i> it's sync rather than async, and there are also problems with possible
</I>&gt;<i> bugs and assumptions within sqlalchemy itself. Basically it's not safe
</I>&gt;<i> and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone to use the orm together within
</I>&gt;<i> a Twisted process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I ended up doing is creating subprocesses that have fairly
</I>&gt;<i> complex logic and usually spend more than a few seconds doing their
</I>&gt;<i> job. By doing this I simply use sqlalchemy synchronously and without
</I>&gt;<i> any problems (I was starting to go completely crazy while trying to
</I>&gt;<i> debug time-dependent errors when I decided to refactor my code to use
</I>&gt;<i> subprocesses instead, everything started working smoothly without any
</I>&gt;<i> relevant change in the logic or in the test code and now I can also
</I>&gt;<i> run the subprocess as a system script to check and verify stuff or
</I>&gt;<i> debug (with pdb)).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Considering that an ORM is only useful (?) for very complex logic I
</I>&gt;<i> consider my approach completely sane. Use the query generator for
</I>&gt;<i> everything and reserve the orm for long running tasks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> nadbapi and storm-twisted tries to solve the orm problem in a similar
</I>&gt;<i> way but nadbapi is no longer maintained, anyway both currently suffer
</I>&gt;<i> from an incredible number of deferreds that they generate making the
</I>&gt;<i> use of defgen an absolute requirement (and thus lowering overall
</I>&gt;<i> performance). If you look hard enough in glyph's old blog or in this
</I>&gt;<i> list (I can't remember where exactly) you can find a post about
</I>&gt;<i> letting the database deal with concurrency and not spread it in
</I>&gt;<i> application code (aka having tons of deferreds). It is true that not
</I>&gt;<i> using threads increases speed and memory usage but for this particular
</I>&gt;<i> case 99% of the time you are not going to need neither of them anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> closing: I recently refactored some code that used sqlalchemy orm into
</I>&gt;<i> using just the query generator and instead of taking 17 seconds it now
</I>&gt;<i> takes 7 seconds and memory usage has decreased considerably. It's not
</I>&gt;<i> really just because an orm is slower than simply executing queries,
</I>&gt;<i> but rather because querying the db was so easy; it was basically done
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;recklessly&quot; without thinking too much about the performance hit of
</I>&gt;<i> going back and forth to the database. This is basically why I'd rather
</I>&gt;<i> not use ORMs unless forced by legacy code or because generating a
</I>&gt;<i> query would introduce so much complexity to make it an application in
</I>&gt;<i> itself (very rare case IMHO).
