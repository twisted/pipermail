But, in our case, requestAvatar can only return something based on what the 
checker returns. I mean, requestAvatar receives an avatarId (as a result of 
Checker#requestAvatarId), a mind and a bunch of interfaces, but the realm 
doesn't have any other information.

What our checker does to authenticate an user, is to call a method on a remote 
service and get back an object (a token) that represents the state of a 
conversation between a client and that remote service. Then, the client may 
issue more remote calls using the previously received token.

We're using Twisted.web only as a front end to a remote service, and we'd like 
to make it as decoupled as possible, as there will be other frontends.

I tried to mimic PB's behaviour, in the sense that (as the cred documentation 
puts out):

&quot;it is an object which serves an important role - any notifications which are 
to be relayed to an authenticated client are passed through a 'mind'. In 
addition, it allows passing more information to the realm during login in 
addition to the avatar ID.&quot;

Actually, our resources are pretty dumb, as they only issue remote calls to an 
external service and don't hold any information. And, since our realm can't 
figure out whether a user can issue a particular call or not without actually 
sending a token to the remote service, a mind object seemed the right place 
to me... but I'd happy to be wrong :-)

Anyway, sorry if I sound as if I'm trying to get a positive opinion for a 
decision we already made :-P it's just that I don't see how the other options 
would completely fit our architecture (which could be broken in the first 
case, of course).

Cheers.
