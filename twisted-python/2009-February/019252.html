So you're doing a ton of work all at once now and you want to split up that
ton of work into smaller pieces and do it a little at a time?

If that's the case, then you don't need to modify the reactor, you just
need to split up the work your code is going.  There are a lot of techniques
for doing this.  coiterate and inlineCallbacks are two solutions which are
closest to &quot;cookie cutter&quot; (ie, you have the least flexibility in deciding
how to use them).

&gt;<i>Some of our code runs twice as fast when using that hack. Are there any 
</I>&gt;<i>chances something similar might be included in Twisted? Or does anyone have 
</I>&gt;<i>a better solution for the described problem?
</I>
Give coiterate or inlineCallbacks a try.  If you need help applying either
of these to your problem, please ask. :)  I can't make any specific
suggestions now because I can only guess at how you're using the reactor
modification you attached.

You have a very long, steep, uphill battle to convince me that adding support
for re-entrant iteration is a good idea.

&gt;<i>Furthermore, I have a question, which is probably related. The documentation 
</I>&gt;<i>of IReactorCore says about the iterate() function:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;The reactor must have been started (via the run() method) prior to any 
</I>&gt;<i>invocations of this method. It must also be stopped manually after the last 
</I>&gt;<i>call to this method (via the stop() method). This method is not re-entrant: 
</I>&gt;<i>you must not call it recursively; in particular, you must not call it while 
</I>&gt;<i>the reactor is running.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This looks to me as if the reactor needs to be running and not running at 
</I>&gt;<i>the same time so that iterate() can be called. Is there an error in my 
</I>&gt;<i>reasoning?
</I>
It's very subtle and intentionally written to sound impossible to use (maybe
that is a stupid idea, but that was my intent when I wrote it ;).  What
you're missing is that there is a way to make reactor.run() return without
stopping the reactor.
