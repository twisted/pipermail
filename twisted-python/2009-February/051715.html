</I>
But the general contract for requestAvatarId is to return a string identifying 
the user. From ICredentialsChecker#requestAvatarId documentation:

&quot;Returns - a Deferred which will fire a string which identifies an avatar, an 
empty tuple to specify an authenticated anonymous user (provided as 
checkers.ANONYMOUS) or fire a Failure(UnauthorizedLogin). Alternatively, 
return the result itself.&quot;

If so, our problem is that the token is an object that contains more 
information (a timestamp, a cryptographic signature, etc.), so serializing 
and deserializing it everytime we need that information is a bit cumbersome. 
The remote service checks that token everytime it receives a call, and 
responds with an appropiate response.

&gt;<i> &gt;I tried to mimic PB's behaviour, in the sense that (as the cred
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; documentation puts out):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&quot;it is an object which serves an important role - any notifications which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are to be relayed to an authenticated client are passed through a 'mind'.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In addition, it allows passing more information to the realm during login
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in addition to the avatar ID.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is technically true but as far as I know no one has ever actually used
</I>&gt;<i> it that way.  I'm trying to think of an authentication scheme which would
</I>&gt;<i> benefit from it (let alone require it), but I'm drawing a blank.  PB just
</I>&gt;<i> has enough expressive power already to really need this.
</I>
In that case, (although we might not actually need a mind in the end), would 
PB have the same problem with HTTPAuthSessionWrapper? The mind argument is 
always None (in HTTPAuthSessionWrapper#_login):

    def _login(self, credentials):
        d = self._portal.login(credentials, None, IResource)
        d.addCallbacks(self._loginSucceeded, self._loginFailed)
        return d

So, I think HTTPAuthSessionWrapper should have a method (e.g. 
createMind(self)), which would return None by default and that could be 
overridden by subclasses if they need to return something else. I'll gladly 
file an issue, provide a patch and a test case, if you think it's a valid 
issue.

&gt;<i> No problem.  Hope this has helped in some way, at least.
</I>
Thanks!
