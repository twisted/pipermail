<PRE>Hi,

background:

I'm currently working on a PoC with twisted, Python, to prove the
technology as an alternative to more
established enterprise choices (java app servers, etc..).

The idea is to build lightweight services to process atomic &quot;chunks&quot;
of business processes, that can scale
horizontally as much as needed proven that the common persistence
layer (a db) scales.
The idea is already working in a non python approach, so the attempt
is to prove that it's quicker and easier to maintain
if built with twisted/python.

So,
the question is: if I have N number of processes running in a M number
of machines, given that there are no network restriction,
and that at least http and hhtps are always available, how these
services would be efficiently monitored?

is there a twisted application/plugin/framework to do so? are you just
create 'polling' requests that an existing monitoring tool (i.e.
Nagios)
parses and interprets? How would you build a &quot;console&quot; to manage
services status?
In a nutshell, what I'm trying to find out if there is already around
a &quot;container-like&quot; twisted based application that can be used to
manage/monitor
twisted applications provided that they adhere to a given interface

Thanks for your help

Micc
