Yeah.  I'm not at all concerned about backwards-compatibility for code that
never worked.

</I>
IResource lacks quite a lot in terms of a read/write filesystem with
metadata like modification times and permission bits.  In the Twisted tree,
something like twisted.conch.interfaces.ISFTPServer (as implemented by e.g.
twisted.conch.unix.SFTPServerForUnixConchUser) is much closer to what FTP
needs.  I think the VFS stuff is closer again.

I think there may be some point in having an IFTPShell-like interface that
maps closely to what the FTP protocol needs, and adapters to map VFS stuff
(and even IResource for simple read-only trees) to that, but I haven't
thought deeply about it.

-Andrew.
