<PRE>OK,  I will adopt the threaded approach.  Despite it's mainloop problems
(they can surface even without twisted) I still like wx.  I develop on a
linux system but support mostly windows clients and wx makes this easy. 
Thanks to everyone for their valuable responses to my questions.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That was an example of where the brokenness would be instantly visible

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What I want to do is have my clients request
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data from the server and wait till the data is ready (seems prettty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :-))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the Twisted way is to invert it so that rather than saying &quot;Wait until
</I>&gt;<i> Y is done, then do X&quot;, you say &quot;Do X when Y is done.&quot;  Among other
</I>&gt;<i> things, this approach lets you do more than one thing at a time.  For
</I>&gt;<i> example, you might want to put a &quot;cancel&quot; button in your UI if your
</I>&gt;<i> application has to run over the internet.  Responding to the cancel
</I>&gt;<i> button at the same time as waiting for a request's response is a
</I>&gt;<i> second thing, so you need to be worried about concurrency even in
</I>&gt;<i> simple applications.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Twisted seems to do what I want (assuming I can interface with wx),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but if you can point to another package please let me know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would point you at gtk, Tkinter, or win32api, not an alternative to
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted :).  wx is the problem here: its mainloop is badly broken, on
</I>&gt;<i> all platforms.  Twisted works fine.  The easiest fix, if wx is a
</I>&gt;<i> genuine requirement, is to run the wx main loop in a Twisted thread,
</I>&gt;<i> using callInThread, so that the Twisted event loop (i.e. the one that
</I>&gt;<i> isn't horribly broken) is &quot;in charge&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that future releases of wx are fixing this issue, as well,
</I>&gt;<i> since you're far from the first person to have complained about it.  I
</I>&gt;<i> hope that this happens soon, since despite its many flaws wx is very
</I>&gt;<i> popular in the Python community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S.: If I seem negative towards WX, it is only because my _only_ use
</I>&gt;<i> of it is answering this same question over and over again.  I'm sure
</I>&gt;<i> it has some positive points too, but I never discover them, because
</I>&gt;<i> for my own development projects &quot;non-broken mainloop&quot; is criterion #1
</I>&gt;<i> for the GUI framework ;-)
