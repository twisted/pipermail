Hi again,

&gt;<i> You can't do that with NATted UDP, either. Quite many firewalls
</I>&gt;<i> want to match all of the (srcIP, srcPort, dstIP, dstPort) to match.
</I>
Well, instead of claiming I'm an expert (!), I will hereby copy an
e-mail that's been posted a few months ago on the p2p-hackers
mailing-list by one of the Limewire developers. It talks about the
proportion of NAT devices which are compatible with the aforementioned
hack ;)

Regards

Antoine.

Subject: RE: [p2p-hackers] Why UDP and not TCP?
 

David,

Our operating environment has not yet stabilized - early beta testers
didn't get the proper port stability tests and our entire user base has
not been upgraded.  However, early indications are that 50 to 60 percent
of firewalled users will benefit.  Again though, the harshest firewalled
users probably have not had a good experience with P2P software so we
are working with a self selected crew.   This method does work with the
Windows XP firewall so we expect it to be widely successful as XP
becomes further adopted.  

One improvement that we can make is to our existing scheme is to handle
firewalls/NATs that use a sequential port assignment algorithm for each
attempt.  Rather than just trying a fixed port, we could try to
negotiate a connection with that port +1, +2 and +3.  I'm not sure what
percentage of users would really benefit from this though.

As has been mentioned here recently, we certainly have noticed that
incoming TCP connections are often possible after the same type of UDP
pinging.  We have no numbers on that though.

Thanks


-greg
