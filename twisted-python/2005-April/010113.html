<PRE>You probably better switch to using separate threads.
Although I basically invented the timer driven &quot;eventloop starving&quot; quite a 
while ago, published it in the python cookbook (which eventually was turned 
into wxreactor by Itamar), I meanwhile switched my application to multiple 
threads. Works way better, particularly on windows.
The timer-eventloop works fine for smaller applications with little to 
moderate network usage, the moment you start transferring more data over the 
network you basically starve both eventloops to death, because neither of the 
loops gets enough CPU attention to do the job properly.

You might want to check out this example:

 <A HREF="http://solipsis.netofpeers.net/wiki/wikka.php?wakka=WxTwistedExample">http://solipsis.netofpeers.net/wiki/wikka.php?wakka=WxTwistedExample</A>

It's a basic example of multiple threads, but it will give you the idea. 
I've written a network wrapper layer to make this whole thing more easy to 
handle, but I can't put this online just yet (contract reasons) - and it's 
very specialized for my application anyways.  Just to give you a hint: once 
you understood how the above example works, you can write wrapper classes for 
the remote referenceable interfaces of twisted. This allows you to use the 
twisted interface the way it's documented without having to fiddle around 
with the threads.

Hope that gives you some clues
