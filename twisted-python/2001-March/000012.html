No, and that sounds interesting.

</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; ...&quot; line does in inform).
</I>
Why?  This adds complexity and I don't understand how it creates any
value.  Many objects do not have a &quot;parent&quot;. Thing(&quot;foo&quot;)(location=bar)
and Thing(&quot;foo&quot;,location=bar) seem pretty much equivalent, to me.

&gt;<i> 	The system should use pre- and post-action rules in a

</I>&gt;<i> dictionaries, with names of actions as keys, and functions as values.
</I>
I intentionally avoided the pre/post action rules in favor of verbs
because they're harder to make sense of in a &quot;real&quot; programming language;
inform's object system was weak in some ways and I felt that was one of
them.

If you want something similiar you can always use twisted.hook but I think
that for most cases such an idea is inadvisable.  Is there something I'm
missing about the pre/post stuff that adds functionality which is not
available otherwise, or makes something common easy?

&gt;<i> 	The parser should just be ported over, or at least enhanced to

</I>&gt;<i> The code uses a lot of gotos and is pretty gory, but I think that

</I>
If you think it's easy, does that mean you volunteer? :)

I do agree that the current parser is in sorry shape; however, making it
inform-style might make the interface (to the parser) more complicated
both for users and developers.  However, to automatically parse 90% of
common verbs into &quot;actions&quot; with a higher-level interface makes sense to
me; I've already started doing something like that in CVS, and there are
emerging conventions about how to represent that.

In the meanwhile, though, patches to make the current parser less heinous,
or emulate Inform style, will be graciously accepted.
