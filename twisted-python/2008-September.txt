Subject: [Twisted-Python] twistd,

Message-ID: <48BB9F60.4000209@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone,

Just a little question about Twistd & the Application framework. I'm 
using the service collection app mechanism
and I was wondering how Twistd handles it. Is there anything special to 
watch out for? Any differences in between running each server as a
separate process (i.e. launching it from a diff term without twistd) and 
with Twistd? Does it spawn a process for each Service/Server?

Thank you,
Gabriel

twistd runs all services in a single process.  In fact, twistd only runs 
one service.  Although that service may be a MultiService which contains 
other services, MultiService does not do anything special to run things 
in other processes either.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] create new domish.Element from string XML
Message-ID: <48BCFAB9.2070203@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone,

I sometimes have to create domish.Element from a string and I can't find 
any way of doing this. I saw that I can add children from a string but 
not create a whole XML tree.
Is there a way of doing this other than creating a dummy element, adding 
the XML string as a child and then extracting the child?

Thank you,
Gabriel

I tried creating a dummy element, adding the raw string as a child using 
"addRawXml()" and then extracting the first child, and this does not 
work because the raw xml string is just added without being parsed. I 
write this up, if anybody is interested, that does what I need. If a 
better method exists, please tell me.

This doesn't really have anything to do with pollreactor.  Any reactor 
that implements IReactorFDSet can monitor a pipe.

It was easier for me to implement this than to explain what to do, so 
here's the code for monitoring a named pipe for read, given its name. 
I'm pretty sure it's not 100% correct, but if you want to read about 
handling I/O events from fifos on your platform, you are welcome to do 
so.

    import os
    from twisted.internet.abstract import FileDescriptor
    from twisted.internet.main import CONNECTION_DONE

    class FIFODescriptor(FileDescriptor):
        def __init__(self, reactor, fifoname, protocol):
            FileDescriptor.__init__(self, reactor)
            self.fifo = os.open(fifoname, os.O_NONBLOCK | os.O_RDONLY)
            self.protocol = protocol
            self.protocol.makeConnection(self)

        def connectionLost(self, reason):
            self.protocol.connectionLost(reason)

        def doRead(self):
            data = os.read(self.fifo, 1024)
            if data:
                self.protocol.dataReceived(data)
            else:
                self.stopReading()
                self.connectionLost(CONNECTION_DONE)

        def fileno(self):
            return self.fifo


And here's a brief program that uses it:

    import sys
    from twisted.internet import reactor
    from twisted.internet.protocol import Protocol
    class PrintingProtocol(Protocol):
        def dataReceived(self, data):
            print 'data', repr(data)
        def connectionMade(self):
            print 'hi'
        def connectionLost(self, reason):
            print 'bye', reason
    fifd = FIFODescriptor(reactor, sys.argv[1], PrintingProtocol())
    fifd.startReading()
    reactor.run()

I tested this by doing 'mkfifo x; python fifo.py x', and in another 
terminal, 'cat > x'.  It should be pretty self-explanitory.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] license / copyright questions about Twisted
	Perspective Broker client
Message-ID: <48BD4C51.6030303@gmail.com>

Hi,
After looking around for the last 6 months for an Actionscript 3 library 
that would work as a client for use with Twisted Perspective Broker
, and hoping someone more skilled than myself would get around to 
creating one, I decided to get the ball rolling.

It currently works as a client for the example here.
http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/pb-cred.html#auto18

There is a long way to go. . . but it's a start.

I aim to release the library under the same license as Twisted (MIT) but 
I'm wondering about some of the details.
Since all I have done is just ported the original Twisted code from 
Python to Actionscript what does that mean in terms of copyright and 
credits ?
Should I give credit in every file according to original author ?
I still have most of the original doc strings in my version - am I 
allowed to use those ?
There are also sections where I have the original python code commented 
out (as a guide to what still needs to done). I can't really be arsed to 
delete all that while it's still in heavy development. Is that a problem 
? Would I have to put the credits for the code in each snippet ?

I have created a Google code project and will get the code up there as 
soon as I have got the paperwork in order.
Cheers,
Al.

I don't feel like analyzing a work today to determine whether it is a
derivative of Twisted, but if you think it is and you want to comply
with being a derivative, all you need to do is include the Twisted
copyright notice.

Hmmm, this code worked when I posted it, and it no longer does... maybe 
the interpreter I was testing it in had an old version cached, but now 
it tells me that "result" is None when "onElement" is called, what I 
don't get is that a clusure should have been created with those internal 
functions, no? When "DocumentStartEvent" is called, It does set 
"result", but when "ElementEvent" is called, "result" no longer exists. 
Does anyone know what's going on?

Thank you,
Gabriel

Hello all,

I am trying to transfer files over a PerspectiveBroker connection with
FilePager and I've run into a problem. The attached cut-down example
works fine with Twisted-2.5.0, but not with Twisted-8.0 or
Twisted-8.1.0. This is with python 2.5.

On version 8 of twisted, a 0-byte file is created and the client never
finished; but with version 2.5, the full file is transferred.

What am I doing wrong; or is this a bug?

Thanks all,

-Samson

Message-ID: <4327dfbd0809031549m17222018xdc533f350f04b083@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I wanted to take a quick moment to share some stuff with the general
email audience that is interested in XMPP/Jabber in Twisted.

First off, some folks don't realize that there is a dedicated
Twisted-Jabber email list for discussing XMPP/Jabber topics. This list
is managed by Twisted's XMPP guru, Ralph Meijer. You can subscribe and
check out the archives here:
  https://mailman.ik.nu/mailman/listinfo/twisted-jabber

Secondly, we've been having some interesting discussions with Twisted
sponsors lately about deep and abiding interests in Twisted XMPP: many
sponsors want us to spend time creating docs and tutorials, improving
support and adding new features. This interest was spearheaded by Jack
Moffitt of Chesspark and given additional momentum by Dhris DiBona of
Google. Furthermore, we've received vocal support for XMPP
improvements from Hydra Labs, Lucasfilm, Security Metrics, and
individual sponsors.

Thirdly, today on #twisted, we had an intense and very productive
discussion about XMPP in general, about it's current support in
Twisted, and then a provisional roadmap for future developments. It
was an excellent experience for all, and one that can be relived by
everyone, thanks to IRC logs :-) A new ticket was created to address
the next step that will to be taken, and that ticket is here:
  http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3407

In that ticket, I linked to the notes and IRC log of our chat:
  http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/XMPPServerArchitecture
  http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/XMPPIRCTranscript20080903

There's lots to do and we're all quite excited about both the
immediate and long-term benefits to be had by Twisted users, community
members, and the project itself with regard to XMPP and messaging
development efforts.

Thanks,

d

Given that it's got such little traffic, maybe it's proven to not be a
good idea to have that mailing list separate from this one. It hides
the conversation that goes on there from a larger audience, and anyone
who reads the archives is going to think that the project is, if not
dead, not very active.

+1 for Twisted XMPP discussions on Twisted Python, at least until the
XMPP code in Twisted is so great and popular that we start getting the
kind of repetitive, uninteresting posts that led to the twisted-web
split.

This is really great. We've been using Twisted-XMPP that acts as a Mobile IM
server (now taking 5k simultaneous connections). I'd be glad to share some
of the experiences and help out with with the development.

Agreed. When I did some work recently to implement the client side of 
pubsub, I found that mailing list moribund and gave up on the idea of 
asking for help there.

Hey Phil,

that sounds nice. Have you looked at all at the stuff that currently 
resides in Wokkel (and, as part of this grand effort will eventually end 
up in Twisted Words)? The pubsub protocol there is the stuff I've been 
working on most. I mostly focused on the component side (for 
implementing Idavoll), but there is good client support in there as 
well. You can also drop me a line via Jabber.

That said, yeah the list might have been somewhat quiet, partly because 
I have been bad at communicating what I've been up to recently. It does 
have about 50 people subscribing to it, and I am so far not convinced 
that all of them would want to be dragged into general Twisted discussions.

I did look at wokkel. I must be honest, first time round I found it a 
bit difficult to decipher, though that might be because it took a while 
to realise that lots of the pieces were in fact server-side ;o)

Once I'd gone to the effort of re-inventing the wheel however, a 2nd 
look back at wokkel made a lot more sense, and I'll certainly use it 
instead of the code I wrote.

The actual project was for ESB-like use, though that's now been put on 
hold (frankly I think XMPP pubsub might be a little new for that, and 
will probably look at ActiveMQ. It didn't help that ejabberd's 
collections are "funny").

What I *did* end up doing was start on a basic Nevow/Athena XMPP client 
with basic roster/message functions and also pubsub support. That might 
make a nice example app.

The notion of an all-twisted XMPP server is intriguing, especially if 
some integration with http://pypi.python.org/pypi/txLoadBalancer were to 
appear!

Thinking about it, you're probably right - the list has been quiet 
because not much has been going on, but that doesn't mean it need remain 
quiet if things are now going to be moving.

I agree with Chris and JP here: I certainly plan to discuss XMPP issues 
here on the main Twisted mailing list.  I _want_ to "drag" these folks 
into general Twisted discussions - and with over 1000 people on this 
list already, with a hugely divergent array of interests in Twisted, 
somehow I am guessing those 50 won't need to be dragged too hard :).

There is still a lot to be decided as to how Twisted's XMPP code will 
integrate with the rest of Twisted: what is the (protocol-agnostic) 
common domain model for chat?  How should different XMPP components and 
modules use twisted.cred?  I think that these core integration 
mechanisms are a huge part of what makes Twisted great.  These questions 
need to be answered by people who know Twisted's abstractions as well as 
those who know XMPP's.

What to do with the twisted-jabber mailing list is certainly up to you, 
and perhaps current discussion of wokkel, palaver, and idavoll does not 
belong here; but certainly development of twisted.words should be 
discussed in as general a forum as possible.

Phil, you're reading my mind :-) That's just the sort of thing I have
planned for txLB's future.

Hey Henrik,

Thanks for sharing!

I would, however, encourage you to create a Paisley branch in
Launchpad and improve the error handling and connection abstraction
there. This would make it much easier for us to merge your changes
into Paisley.

At the very least, you may want to register your project with
Launchpad and associate it with the tx project group, so people can
find it easily (the tx project group, or "super project" is for
Twisted community code).

Also, are you aware that web2 features are being slowly ported to web,
and that twisted.web will continue to be the official web library?

Thanks again!

Changing the connection abstraction and error handling in paisley would make
it extremely similar to couched. The main difference would be the name :-).

I might do it.

Btw. I've created a second release of couched which supports views and
probably fixes a few other things. Just forgot to release it. Couched was
mainly an exercise in understanding the CouchDB interface.

I'm aware that something might or might not happen in the twisted web world
:-).

<begin twisted web rant which would be much better suited for twisted-web>
Frankly I've given up following the web vs. web2 discussions. I used web2 as
it is what I am familiar with, and I wanted connection caching. I have a
significant code base using web2 and beside a few issues (for which I've
submitted patches and bugs, but nothing happens) it works fine, though I
have to maintain a patchset for it :-/. Twisted web is currently not an
option (I need request pipelining and http 1.1).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] XMPP authentication question : when is the
	username sent?
Message-ID: <48C13593.8050409@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone,

I am trying to figure out how the auth works, for this I used the simple 
example client. The question is, when is the username sent? In the 
output I never see the username being sent, I see the server at some 
point sending it to me.

Thank you,
Gabriel

Username is : test_user at localhost

Output :

    Connected.

Ok, I thought that was the password, and that something maybe wasn't 
printing out to stdout, makes sense now. Thank you,

We're trying to use twisted as a sort of bus, a centralized place to manage all of our SOA enpoints (mostly through XML-RPC). We have a few services that access the Oracle DB directly (adbapi). In production we're getting intermittent ConnectionLost exceptions from cx_Oracle. Most of these are queries that take a couple of seconds.

Has anyone seen this kind of behavior before? What we're probably going to do in the short term is just remove twisted from the equation for these methods that seem to be timing out. But we're relatively new to twisted and I wonder if we're doing something that's obviously wrong.

Hi Henrik,

Patches to Paisley would be greatly appreciated.

Please file tickets about making twisted.web support the HTTP/1.1  
features you need, this is the best way to get that support into  
Paisley.

It just saddens me to see a 3rd couchdb python client library spring  
up.  2 is bad enough but one being asynchronous and one being  
synchronous means it can't really be helped.  Paisley development  
hasn't stopped it just hasn't really needed much work.

Hmm, it is kind of hard to say what the problem could be, without
seeing the code that is using adbapi and cx_Oracle.

When you say you are receiving ConnectionLost exceptions from cx_Oracle,
are they *really* from cx_Oracle, i.e., "ORA-03135 - Connection lost...",
or are they just the result of adbapi calling its connectionLost method?

I've used cx_Oracle with twisted many times, with many different workloads,
including stored procedures with OUT parameters, and it has always worked
as expected.  If you are able to provide some code, this list might be
able to provide you with more prescriptive advice.

Hope this helps,

I looked at the adbapi code and it appears the ConnectionLost exception is coming from there, not from cx_Oracle. At least that's what is in the error log:

"exception caught here" is telling you where in the call stack the exception
was caught. Frames above it weren't escaped by the exception. Frames below
it were.

I think you're seeing an example of poor error reporting in adbapi.  This
has recently been improved and the improvements will be included in the
next release of Twisted.  If you can somehow test a recent trunk revision
of Twisted, you might find that it reports a more specific problem which
points to the actual cause of the failure.

What this does indicate, I think, is that you had a transaction which
could not be committed for some reason.  adbapi is rolling back the
transaction before reporting the reason the commit failed.  However,
the ConnectionLost exception, which is boring and not really relevant
to anything you're doing, is happening before the real exception can be
reported.

It seems that you have been a victim of at least one recently-fixed bug:

    http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3244

and at least one long-standing one:

    http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/1753

As you can see from the tone of my (unfortunate) comment on the latter 
ticket, I don't think a lot of people use Oracle with Twisted.

However, the issue is simple to hack around temporarily: set your 
ConnectionPool's "good_sql" attribute to 'select 1 from dual' as itamar 
suggests on #1753.

Then, please submit a patch, and ideally a buildslave with a copy of 
oracle installed so that we can maintain support for it :).

It seems that you have been a victim of at least one recently-fixed bug:

    http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3244

and at least one long-standing one:

    http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/1753

As you can see from the tone of my (unfortunate) comment on the latter 
ticket, I don't think a lot of people use Oracle with Twisted.

However, the issue is simple to hack around temporarily: set your 
ConnectionPool's "good_sql" attribute to 'select 1 from dual' as itamar 
suggests on #1753.

Then, please submit a patch, and ideally a buildslave with a copy of 
oracle installed so that we can maintain support for it :).

Hmm.  I was guessing about the most likely cause since the other (fixed) 
bug inhibits error reporting.

Do you get a more useful traceback out of twisted trunk at HEAD?  I 
wouldn't advocate using that in production, but the error-logging bugfix 
would tell you at least what's really going wrong.

This could be way off base, but i used to see this on stale
connections being  utilized again in the next xmlrpc job, basically
timing out. (mysqldb- Mysql Server has gone away). Using db.ping()
could keep them alive, or testing the connection/recreating before
executing a new xmlrpc job.

do these exceptions occur when they are running not through the xmlrpc.

HTTP 1.1 status codes, notable 303 (see other). I could probably use 302,
but 303 is the "correct" behaviour for my case. This should be relatively
easy to implement.

Furthermore I need the server to support large uploads (last i checked the
640K limitation was still there) and downloads, and with reasonable
efficiancy.  I'm not saying streams are the answer but it works for me
(actually I use the producer/consumer interface in my lower level code and
then adapt it in the web layer). Unfortunately I've had to rewrite a lot of
the producer/consumer code and stream stuff and glue it together, as some of
the stuff in twisted (not just in web2) is rather broken. For complete
insanity (sorry to whoever wrote it ) see
twisted.protocols.basic.FileSender, which implements its own magic method
beginFileTransfer, which takes BOTH a file and a consumer as argument. This
makes is impossible to seperate the construction of the producer and
starting the transfer.

Ticket #1956 fixes some of these things. I'm not quite sure how it handles
errors (which can happen both ways), but I've just had a quick look. It's
been a whlie since i've had a look at all this. I write a bit about it,
which I've placed here: http://www.cs.aau.dk/~htj/prodcons.txt

IMHO, getting (and deciding on) a proper producer/consumer interface need to
happen, to make whatever web things twisted will have usefull. Changing the
producer/consumer might be massive API break, however it is a needed one.
There are simply things the current API cannot do (i usually return a
deferred along with any producer/consumer object to indiciate how the data
moving went). I might be interested in participating in this, however I'm
rather work struck as I have to hand my ph.d. thesis at the end of this
year.

Btw. I really am a huge fan of twisted, however the web and
producer/consumer is a rather dark spot in an otherwise bright world :-)

Will you accept a switch to web2, otherwise there is very little point to
it. Otherwise the patch kit needs to look like this:

Proper producer/consumer infrastructure in twisted
Integrate the above in twisted.web along with http 1.1 response codes, and
request pipelining.
Some patches to paisley, which would be quite small compared to the other.

Sorry, but it is not that simple :-)

Please file tickets about making twisted.web support the HTTP/1.1 features

Without getting into some large discussion here, I think that some diversity
is actually a good thing. Of course it is no use having several half
implementations lying around (the python community excels at this :-)), than
having a single working library. However. the interface of couchdb is simple
enough that a full client library can be written rather fast. This is not
sad, but very nice :-).

Please feel free to use twisted.web2 if it is meeting your needs 
currently.  However, our goal remains to focus maintenance effort on 
twisted.web and provide a gradual, compatible evolution to a better 
webserver.  The HTTP 1.1 features that you need will eventually be added 
to twisted.web, and I hope that the split with paisley can be resolved 
at that point.

I personally don't use couchdb or have any interest in its bindings, but 
it sounds like you have some other misconceptions about twisted and its 
development process which I'd like to correct.
>>Which other HTTP 1.1 features do you need?

640k limitation?  In twisted.web?  As far as I know there's no such 
thing; the only 640k limitation I know of anywhere in Twisted is in PB, 
and that's just on individual message size.  A brief skim through the 
twisted.web client and server code doesn't reveal any obvious size 
limitations that I can see.  (Is there some 640k limitation in the 'cgi' 
module?)

If there is such a limitation it should be more clearly documented 
somewhere.

True, twisted.web doesn't provide a graceful way for resources to handle 
streaming file uploads as they arrive, but for dedicated servers it is 
certainly *possible*; Request.handleContentChunk says it's "not for 
users", but you could easily write a few simple patches which would make 
it "for users", or just subclass it and ignore the docstring.  Nothing 
in twisted.web is really that hard to fix.

Ticket #1956 is still kind of stuck defining the problem.

If you have comments or thoughts on #1956, please feel free to add them 
as comments.  Text files lying around the web are not as helpful as 
discussions on tickets.

Your text file suffers from the same problems as the existing discussion 
on the ticket, though: a lack of concrete use-cases and example code. 
There are lots of proposed solutions but not a lot of proposed problems. 
(I am certainly a guilty party here, I really should describe the 
problem in more detail.)  We all feel there is some inelegance, but 
there is no example of some code that we can all agree is gross and 
would be fixed by some better API.

Please come up with an example - the shorter the better - of a 
deficiency in the streaming API and put it on the ticket.  Hopefully 
that will further the discussion there.

No.

1. We will never break compatibility with an API this old and this 
stable.  When we do start to move over to a new API, the transition will 
be particularly gradual and slow given the core nature of this API and 
the fact that pretty much everything uses it.  Even if it were only 
around for one release, see 
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CompatibilityPolicy

2. It's not clear what the new API would be.  Every suggestion proposed 
thus far has some issues, and there's no clear winner.  Unless someone 
takes the time to really thoroughly explain the problem and describe 
what effect the solution would have, with examples, then we're not going 
to make any progress.

3. There isn't anything that you *can't do* with 
ITransport/IProducer/IConsumer/IProtocol.  It can be slightly awkward 
sometimes, but I have yet to see an example where you really can't make 
something work.  For example, IConsumer doesn't have .finish(), but 
that's fine, because you probably mean IProtocol.connectionLost(...) 
anyway.  Some users of these interfaces don't provide nice ways to get 
data in and out, and yes, a uniform and consistent way to deal with 
slinging data between endpoints (for example, a standard, featureful 
object to remix a 'protocol' into a 'transport' and vice versa) would 
probably help with that.  Given that the deficiency creates momentary 
inconveniences rather than impossibilities, there's no way we're going 
to break *every single twisted program ever* just to make it slightly 
more convenient.

4. Given that the semantics are already there, it will be very easy to 
evolve new code to call old interfaces, provide adapters which wrap 
around things and generally make it easy to have some hypothetical shiny 
new interface cooperate just fine with the crufty old ones.

You can try to use Nginx with the upload module
http://www.grid.net.ru/nginx/upload.en.html

The upload module parse the multipart/form-data entity body, and saves 
all file fields to temporary files.

The backend server receive a multipart/form-data entity body where each 
file field is replaced with several fields: *_name, *_content_type, 
*_file_name, *_tmp_path (names are configurable).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] intermittent problem: not accepting new connections
Message-ID: <043501c91384$4c2c6b00$e4854100$@com>

I have had a twisted epoll server that was heavily used, such that it
saturated CPU (100% shown by "top", about 5000 connections, intense message
relaying).
I am using twisted 2.5.0 that I patched for epoll bug.
It was run on python 2.4.4 , 2.6.11 kernel on a single core xeon 3.0 GHz
CPU. This server has been on for many months, and it has been rock-stable.

A couple of days ago I migrated that server to a newer machine: same patched
twisted 2.5.0, same python 2.4.4, newer 2.6.24 kernel and a quad core xeon
L5420 CPU. 
CPU usage dropped from 100% to 30%, as expected, with the same rate of
client connections.

However the server now has the following intermittent problem: about twice a
day, it stops accepting new connections for a short period of 5-10 minutes.

telnet times out, I get this:
root at serv2:/proc/net/netfilter# telnet localhost 5229

Trying 127.0.0.1...

Existing connections are not cut, they server receives/delivers messages
to/from them just fine.
These short periods of not accepting connections do not correlate with
increased CPU load or with the overall number of connections to the server.

I have had a problem with the same symptoms before, when a server process
run out of its quota of file descriptors.
However, there were clear messages in the twisted log at that time, and
upping the ulimits solved the problem.
This time, there are no errors in ANY logs (twisted log. /var/log/messages,
etc)

I am out of ideas on what this could be, because my setup is exactly the
same as I have been using in the last year, except for a faster CPU and a
newer kernel?

I suspect that there are some new uncaught accept() exceptions in
internet/tcp.py in the part where it's looking for EMFILE, ENOBUFS, ENFILE,
ENOMEM, ECONNABORTED errors.

Do non-error log messages continue to appear in the Twisted log?  ie, is
it clear that the logging system is still working, or could it have failed
in some way, obscuring any exception reports?

Any new unhandled errno values should definitely result in an exception
being logged (notice that the `raise? which follows the checks for
various errno values is inside a try/except which logs any exception).

Yes, I print the results of garbage collection every 10 min like this:

print "number of objects tracked by the garbage collector is:", len(gc.get_objects())

and they appear in the main twisted log.

2008/09/10 13:21 -0700 [-] number of objects tracked by the garbage collector is: 860021
2008/09/10 13:31 -0700 [-] number of objects tracked by the garbage collector is: 864316

I noticed that raise too... Could it then be EWOULDBLOCK, EAGAIN or EPERM?

                except socket.error, e:
                    if e.args[0] in (EWOULDBLOCK, EAGAIN):
                        self.numberAccepts = i
                        break
                    elif e.args[0] == EPERM:
                        # Netfilter on Linux may have rejected the
                        # connection, but we get told to try to accept()
                        # anyway.
                        continue


I am not sure how to debug this problem- I have another twisted server of a different type on that machine, and while the problematic server stops accepting connections, the second one works just fine, so this is not a machine-wide issue.
What could it be?

You could try running strace against the server while it's not accepting
connections.  You can limit the output to just accept calls, too:

   strace -p <pid> -etrace=accept

Maybe this will show you that accept calls are happening but failing in
some way.  If it produces no output, you can widen it and see if you can
tell what the server is doing if it isn't calling accept().

I have one short question before I try strace on live:

I have been playing with strace this morning on my dev, and I observe that for every second connection, there are two accept calls, one is success and one is a failure:

1st connection:

accept(9, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(33375), sin_addr=inet_addr("10.14.0.2")}, [16]) = 22
(client disconnects)

2nd connection:
accept(9, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(33519), sin_addr=inet_addr("10.14.0.2")}, [16]) = 22
accept(9, 0xbfaada10, [16])             = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
(client disconnects)

3d connection:
accept(9, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(33375), sin_addr=inet_addr("10.14.0.2")}, [16]) = 22
(client disconnects)

4th connection:
accept(9, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(33519), sin_addr=inet_addr("10.14.0.2")}, [16]) = 22
accept(9, 0xbfaada10, [16])             = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
....
and so on.

What is the meaning of 
accept(9, 0xbfaada10, [16])             = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable) 
that occurs every second connection?

I'm pretty sure this is a consequence of a heuristic optimization in the
accept loop.  When one connection is successfully accepted, a counter is
incremented.  Whenever it tries to accept connections, it will try up to
the number of times indicated by the current value of the counter.  When
it fails to get a new connection, it drops the counter to the number of
connections it did accept.  So in a lot of cases, it's flipping back and
forth between 1 and 2 attempts.

The point of this is that if you're receiving lots of connection attempts,
it'd be faster to accept many of them at once instead of only accepting one
each time around the reactor loop.  It's not clear the current implementation
is the best way to implement this optimization, but at least the code is very
old and hasn't changed in quite a while, so it's probably not actually causing
any problems.

It went into this regime again tonight, and I captured strace.

A few remarks first:

The outage was brief, it lasted about 3 min. It did not correspond to the peak number of connections.
The application has several protocols (like manhole and various control ports), that are listening on different ports.
When the server stopped accepting connections on the main port (where external internet clients connect), telnet connection to manhole and control ports are still possible.
Also, I think when it is in this bad state, it does accept some external connections, maybe 50%.

Anyway, here's the strace in the bad state:

The only noticeable difference is the frequency of 
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) @ 0 (0) ---
but it occurred in the normal state as well.
The server sends emails via child subprocesses, so I suspect Child exited may be due to that.

If that's the case, the strace output is identical, and I do not understand what's causing the problem at all.

Hi Alec

just wondering...

How does netstat look like?

We ran into problems resource wise with the number of open connections 
aka file descriptors per process and observed similar problems to yours, 
also by switching to a new server.

How does ulimit -a compare between old and new machine?

HTH, Werner

Not necessarily related to what you've described, but I'll share
something that's helped a good deal on my most-heavily hit twisted
servers. Presuming you're using Linux:

 echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_recycle


from http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.kernel.obscure.html :

"Enable fast recycling TIME-WAIT sockets. Default value is 1. It
should not be changed without advice/request of technical experts"

My expert advice: only use this on machines connected on a low-latency
LAN. It *will* break internet-facing interfaces. It halves the
constant used by the Nagle algorithm:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle's_algorithm

Kind regards,

This is somewhat interesting.  It suggests a potential problem which
I hadn't thought about before.  If you need to accept more than about
64k connections (not necessarily concurrent) in less than TIME-WAIT
seconds, you might run out of ports.  Anyone know what happens to new
connection attempts to a server in this condition?

Alec, any idea if your server could be getting into this state every
once in a while?  This is an appealing hypothesis, since it wouldn't
necessarily happen at peak connection time (but potentially shortly
after a peak), would resolve itself given a short period of time,
wouldn't necessarily prevent all new connection attempts, since old
TIME-WAIT sockets would be gradually timing out (so your other low-
volume servers might still appear to be working normally), wouldn't
interfere with already established connections, and might not change
the userspace-visible syscall behavior (depending on what Linux does
in this case, but I wouldn't be surprised if connection failures due
to this never showed up in an accept(2) result).

Why would you run out of ports? accept()ed sockets use the same port as 
the listen()ing socket.

Shortening TIME_WAIT just saves on kernel memory.

Uh yes, I guess that would be a fatal flaw in this hypothesis.  Woops. :)

> How does netstat look like?

I have to wait for another outage tonight, to get more definite results on
this.
So far, I have had only one very brief outage at 7:46am
I was asleep, but I have some new data logged.
I have two servers, one on port 5222 (problematic one, let's call it serv1
), and one on 5228 (that has no problems, call it serv2 ).
I made a script that measures the number of connections on each type of
server respectively like this:

while [ 1 ]
do
 sleep 5
 netstat -ant | grep ESTABLISHED | awk '/:5228 /{a += 1}/:5222 /{b += 1} END
{print strftime(" %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S", systime(
))"   serv2: "a"   serv1: "b" total: "a+b }'
done

This is what happened around 7:46am (lines that have "+" in front indicate
anomaly):

Each server also reports the maximum numbers of authenticated connected
clients to the database.
Even though serv1 peaked at 07:44:46  at 4327 "ESTABLISHED" connections, the
number of normally authenticated clients in the database for this time
period is only 1100, which does not reflect this weird connections spike. 
Since I was asleep at 7:46am, I did not have a chance to investigate what
those connections actually were.

> Anyone know what happens to new
> connection attempts to a server in this condition?

One thing that I noticed yesterday, that when server was in this condition,
telnet simply hang, as if no ACK packet was received back:

alecm at serv2 ~> telnet localhost 5222
Trying 127.0.0.1...

and nothing

This behavior or telnet seems to be unique to the case when ACK is not
received in the handshake, I verified that with tcpdump. To contrast that,
if nothing listens on the destination port for example, telnet gives:

alecm at serv2 ~> telnet localhost 50007
Trying 127.0.0.1...
telnet: connect to address 127.0.0.1: Connection refused
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused

which corresponds to RST packet that kernel returns in that case.
I tried to write a 5 line mucked up server with accept() not returning any
packets, and failed.

We had a similar problem like this, might as well share it with you guys:

Our Jabber server stopped taking in new connections due to our iptables at
some point in time (even lost some packets). We have an ip routing scheme
where ports 25,80,5223,10873 routed to 5222. Whenever this happens, we get
error error from our syslogs:

""ip_conntrack: table full, dropping packet"

http://support.imagestream.com/Resolving_ip_conntrack_table_full_Errors.html

Might as well check dmesg if you have something like this. What we did is
disable iptables and removed its kernel modules.

I'm trying to send a post request like so
 getPage('http://localhost/test/test/', method='POST' postdata='test=asdf')

But the server script doesnt get any post arguments.
I was looking at the code for web.client and cant see where im doing
wrong here.
Any ideas what might be the problem? I'm using an svn checkout of Twisted.

Use twisted.python.logfile.LogFile wirte log?Memory can not be released,
does anybody familiar with or encounter such a situation?

Environment: FREEBSD 6.3 RELEASE
twisted svn trunk today


Description of the problem
Use "TOP" command observe the used memory, memory first use the BUF, if
buf>111M, then don't use buf
and use WIRED, Wired to around 132 M? and then use Inact
If during the service  manually delete the generated file. Memory will be
released.
twisted.python.logfile.LogFile default  log file will be closed at 1 M size,
and re-open a file, how the file is closed? but the memory still not
released?

sorry for my poor english.. thank you


**test code?

Try:
getPage('http://localhost/test/test/?test=asdf', method='POST' postdata='')

If you want to use postdata, you'll have to encode it yourself. AFAIK
there is no method for doing this in twisted.web. I've used the
following which is based on[1]:


def encode_multipart_formdata(fields, files, content_type=
'application/octet-stream'):
    """
    fields is a sequence of (name, value) elements for regular form fields.
    files is a sequence of (name, filename, value) elements for data to

I wanted to post that I solved the problem, and it's unrelated to Twisted.

I noticed that this server had sudden increases in the numbers of
ESTABLISHED connections in netstat, but not in the number of authenticated
connections reported by twisted to the database. These increases correlated
with the connection outages.
Creating a shell script that monitors the connection rate, and invoking
tcpdump and sorting/counting the source IPs when it increases, showed that
this server was pounded twice a day for 3-5min from a small set of IPs with
new connections at about 100 conns/sec, that sent some junk data (these
connections timed out in twisted, because that junk never contained my line
separator, and I am using LineOnlyReceiver protocol). This was hardly an
attack against my server, because this new server was assigned an IP that I
have never used before- I guess this is just an internet reality ;)

Even though this does not look like SYN attacks (few connections were in
SYN_RCVD state), for some reason enabling net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1 made
everything normal. When these bizarre connections began to pile uo, I
started seeing 
"possible SYN flooding on port 5222. Sending cookies."
in /var/log/messages , and the connectivity outages stopped

I am sorry for the confusion, I was emboldened by finding the epoll bug back
in April, but this time Twisted continues to rock, and it's just a stupid
Ubuntu's tcp setting.

We had a similar problem like this, might as well share it with you guys:

Our Jabber server stopped taking in new connections due to our iptables at
some point in time (even lost some packets). We have an ip routing scheme
where ports 25,80,5223,10873 routed to 5222. Whenever this happens, we get
error error from our syslogs:

""ip_conntrack: table full, dropping packet"

http://support.imagestream.com/Resolving_ip_conntrack_table_full_Errors.html

Might as well check dmesg if you have something like this. What we did is
disable iptables and removed its kernel modules.

I have to wait for another outage tonight, to get more definite results on
this.
So far, I have had only one very brief outage at 7:46am
I was asleep, but I have some new data logged.
I have two servers, one on port 5222 (problematic one, let's call it serv1
), and one on 5228 (that has no problems, call it serv2 ).
I made a script that measures the number of connections on each type of
server respectively like this:

while [ 1 ]
do
?sleep 5
?netstat -ant | grep ESTABLISHED | awk '/:5228 /{a += 1}/:5222 /{b += 1} END
{print strftime(" %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S", systime(
))" ? serv2: "a" ? serv1: "b" total: "a+b }'
done

This is what happened around 7:46am (lines that have "+" in front indicate
anomaly):

Each server also reports the maximum numbers of authenticated connected
clients to the database.
Even though serv1 peaked at 07:44:46 ?at 4327 "ESTABLISHED" connections, the
number of normally authenticated clients in the database for this time
period is only 1100, which does not reflect this weird connections spike.
Since I was asleep at 7:46am, I did not have a chance to investigate what
those connections actually were.

> Anyone know what happens to new
> connection attempts to a server in this condition?
One thing that I noticed yesterday, that when server was in this condition,
telnet simply hang, as if no ACK packet was received back:

alecm at serv2 ~> telnet localhost 5222
Trying 127.0.0.1...
and nothing

This behavior or telnet seems to be unique to the case when ACK is not
received in the handshake, I verified that with tcpdump. To contrast that,
if nothing listens on the destination port for example, telnet gives:

alecm at serv2 ~> telnet localhost 50007
Trying 127.0.0.1...
telnet: connect to address 127.0.0.1: Connection refused
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused

which corresponds to RST packet that kernel returns in that case.
I tried to write a 5 line mucked up server with accept() not returning any
packets, and failed.

I ran the test code on Ubuntu Hardy but I don't see any memory problems.
I let the program run for about two minutes and memory remained constant
for the entire time.

LogFile doesn't do very much besides write to a Python file object.  Can
you reproduce the memory problem just using a file without using LogFile?

Thanks for the follow up and explaination.  It's good to know what was
going on here and what the fix was, even though it wasn't anything in
Twisted.

I will assume you did things like check your web server's log to see if a connection was made and if there was an error.....

Since you are using the POST method, I would expect you would have to set the headers argument (a dictionary). I notice the header argument is missing. I would expect entries such as Content-Type and Content-Length.

Cheers,
Andrew

Hi, Jean-Paul, thank you for reply and test;)

I open a single file, write the same data, memory is not automatically
released, after i delete the file, memory released..

Problem was I was missing the content type header. The content length
value is calculated somewhere in twisted.web.client
I just put in there the same content type firefox sends when posting a
form. Now it works.


getPage(url,method='POST',postdata=urllib.urlencode({'check_data':check_data}),headers={'Content-Type':'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'})

Thanks for the suggestions.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Using the Oscar protocol to send SMS text msgs
Message-ID: <BLU121-W10612CDD20ECDB5D0FF2C4D24D0@phx.gbl>

I'm wondering if anyone happens to have an example of how to send an SMS message through AIM using twisted.words.protocols.oscar.  Sending instant messages based on the code in oscardemo.py was simple enough, but when I tried to send a message to a phone number through an oscar.BOSConnection.sendMessage method such as:

self.sendMessage("+19995551212", [(msg,)], wantAck=0, autoResponse=False)

an SMS text message does not appear to be sent to the specified phone number, however, the number I tried to send the message to did end up appearing under "Recent Buddies" in AIM after trying this.  If I then attempt to send an SMS manually through version 6.9.1.2 of the AIM client it works as expected.  I'm guessing that perhaps a connection or ICBM parameter needs to be set to enable SMS messaging for the client connection made through oscar.  I looked at the code for the oscar protocol in Pidgin to see if that would shed any light on what I could be doing incorrectly and didn't see anything special being done for SMS text messages there aside from converting them to plain text before sending the message along in the same way as IM's are sent except that the user name is a phone number in the +<area code><number> format I've been trying with.  

thanks,

Dave

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Calling deferToThread from a thread
Message-ID: <95bb10690809180242r7688b554u3dd05c33f69a642d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have a data store api that mandates the return of deferreds for each
call. I have a number of implementations for the api - an in-memory
one for testing, and a number of other network + disk based apis.

My issue is this - I'm using py.test for unit testing (I'm aware of
trial, but for compatibility reasons with the rest of the project I
haven't looked into using it). To test deferred-based code I have set
up a separate thread which the reactor runs in (the setup and teardown
code is shown below for anyone who is interested).

def net():
    reactor.run(installSignalHandlers=0)

def setup_module(mod):
    global net_thread
    net_thread = threading.Thread(target=net)
    net_thread.start()
    time.sleep(1)

def teardown_module(module):
    reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop)

This seems to work generally fine. The problem (or at least I *think*
it's the problem) is that in one of my implementations uses
deferToThread internally to create a deferred which it then returns to
the caller. Is it thread safe to call a deferToThread in a separate
thread? Normally I'd do a reactor.callFromThread, but I'm not sure how
to get a deferred by this construct.

I see two options:
1. In my unit test I write a function f which makes the api call and
gets the deferred, and sets it to a local variable within the test
instance. Then I schedule f to run in the reactor thread via
reactor.callFromThread
2. I look into trial which has support for this kind of stuff??

Thanks for any help.

Cheers,
Reza

deferToThread isn't special.  Like pretty much any Twisted API, it is
only safe to call in the reactor thread.  It doesn't matter if the
reactor thread is the main thread or another one - whichever, that's
the only thread Twisted APIs are safe in.

Your best bet is to look at py.test's support for xunit style tests.
Whenever you need to deal with Deferreds, you should be using trial's
TestCase.  Anything else you do will be fragile and prone to break (as
trial is, but at least we will fix it when it breaks so that you don't
have to).

Hi
Can anyone tell me which is the best way to distribute a commercial
project based on Twisted for Linux.
It would be great if I can make .rpm and .deb packages which will
include twisted and some compiled modules of the project.
But I'm not sure how to do this. Should i turn to distutils or tap2rpm?

trial has very good support for deferreds.  If your test method returns
a deferred then trial magically does the right thing.  You don't need to
manage the reactor yourself.  See Twisted's docs and unit tests for
examples.

trial's API is based on unittest's, which is based on JUnit's.  Works
fine, but it has the Java nature.

I recommend trying nose.  It has support for deferreds, using a
decorator.  And its API is based on the py.test API.  Unfortunately they
chose to spell setup and teardown differently, so you can't use your
py.test test modules unchanged, but the changes are usually trivial.

Hi All,
I'm trying to pick up Twisted and I'm having trouble with looping.

I expected that a Deferred returned from a looping call would be available
after each call.  But it's only available after the loop is stopped.  Am I
looking for a different class?

Thanks,
Dave

p.s.  Ultimately I'd like to watch a file and post any new lines up to an
HTTP server.  If there is a direct way to get there, please let me know.
Thanks!

Hi,

We've successfully used bbfreeze
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bbfreeze/0.95.4) to build binaries with
twisted on linux. To make a deb from that binary is pretty easy, read
up on the 'dpkg-deb' command. You can also convert that .deb to an
.rpm using a tool called 'alien'.

It's not, and if you think about it, it can't - a loopingcall is setup 
once and run indefinitely, who would you be "returning" the deferreds 
to, and how?

Just call your handler from within your loopingcall i.e.

def check_file(fp, cb):
   # blah blah
   for line in lines:
     cb(line)

The code you show isn't a very robust way of following a file. My advice 
would be to run "tail -F -q name" in a sub-process and accumulate the 
output.

You need to be aware when watching an external file that when you read, 
the whole line might not have been written, so you need to do something 
like this:

buffer = ''
def check(file, handler):
   buffer += file.read()
   if not '\n' in buffer:
     return

   lines = buffer.split('\n')
   # the final "line" in the buffer doesn't have a terminating
   # \n, make it be the buffer and drop it from out list
   buffer = lines.pop()
   for line in lines:
     handler(line)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] UDP vs TCP for bittorrent-style file transfer
Message-ID: <d6bdc39c0809211735h7b4d22d8h3710a87f312e0db0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list, I'd like to revive a topic touched on in the past. I'm playing with
python socket programming and decided I want to make a simplistic bittorrent
clone that uses UDP instead of TCP. My main reasons for the protocol choice
are (1) I don't need guaranteed in-order delivery, and (2) I need to get
around NAT restrictions without making the user manually forward ports.
Couple questions...

1. Are those good reasons to ditch TCP, or am I being an idiot? (Always a
possibility.)

2. Even though I don't need TCP's in-order guarantee, I still need an
ACKing mechanism to make sure all the packets eventually arrive. Is there
any (simple) code written that accomplishes this with UDP?

It's not easier to get UDP through NATs.  It's just as hard or harder.

It must be a widely held error, then, because it's what I hear every time
the subject arises. My understanding was that since UDP doesn't have the
concept of "streams," most NATs will allow all UDP packets through to a
given port one it is first hole-punched.

Nat traversal aside, I'm also concerned about performance, and since TCP
doesn't make in-order delivery optional, I'm still tempted to stick with
UDP...

For a bittorrent-like application, you're also not particularly concerned
with *latency*, just throughput.  Allowing out-of-order delivery primarily
reduces latency, it doesn't do a whole lot for throughput.

That's a good point, I didn't consider that. Latency is only really
important for streaming media and gaming, so this probably is a bad idea
after all. Well anyway thanks for the input, I appreciate it.

I'd like to be able to use the twisted plugin mechanism to extract
classes that implement given interfaces. I've successfully followed
the examples to get an iterator over _objects_ that provide my

Does such a facility exist or am I going to need a rethink? Thanks in advance...

Hi Paul,

Try using classProvides() instead of implements() in your class  
definition. That should result in the plugin system returning the  
class itself, instead of the instance.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Having some kind of "finally" clause
Message-ID: <145518663ff04ce4300f2ccdf3b2ee4a@chopper.luffy.cx>


Hi!

I would like to do something like this with Twisted:

x.open()
try:
 x.someoperations()
 x.otheroperations()
finally:
 x.close()

I could do something like this :

d = open_and_get_x()
d.addCallback(someoperations)
d.addCallback(otheroperations)
d.addBoth(closeAndReRaiseIfError)
return d

Each callback would return x to let the next callback proceed it. However,
if there is an error, I have no "x" to close in "closeAndReRaiseIfError".
How can I do that?

Thanks.

There are a lot of ways.  You could make x an attribute of a shared object,
or you could close over it in the first callback to create the "finally"
handler, or you could pass it along as an argument to the `addBoth? call
(again, in the first callback).

Notice that there's a slight difference between the two code examples you
gave.  The first won't close x in response to errors from `x.open()?, but
`closeAndReRaiseIfError? will be called even for errors from `open_and_get_x?.
If you only add the finally handler in the first callback attached to `d?,
then this difference goes away.

Yes, that's usually true, especially for home NATs. Some NATs do  
actually track UDP conversations between endpoints just like TCP  
streams, though. Traversing a NAT with UDP is /usually/ easier, when  
you have multiple endpoints you wish to hear from. But don't forget  
about the other kinds of NATs too, which you'll also have to implement  
support for. That's what makes it hard: implementing things multiple  
times for all the different network topologies.

Not entirely true. In order delivery is preserved to your application,  
but out-of-order delivery between the host endpoints is supported.  
Read up on the TCP "selective ACK" feature [1], which basically all  
OSes made since 1998 or so support. So a missed packet or two doesn't  
actually require all later data to always be retransmitted.

How can I program a service in Twisted that listens for both UDP and
TCP traffic at the same port? I naively created two services for it,
but then got into an error message because I was listening the same

Disregard my message; it seems the problem was that the port I tried
to use was really in use, because using the same setup on another port
DID work.

If you are a piece of software behind a NAT, and you want to accept a 
connection from a peer, there are three things you can do:

  1. Require some explicit configuration from the user; ask them to punch 
a hole through their NAT and tell you what port to use.  This is by far 
the easiest for you, but considered unacceptable since its default 
configuration will usually be broken.
  2. Use a protocol like UPnP or Nat-PMP to get around the user's router. 
This will work on a minority of deployed endpoints, but when it does 
work it will work great, and your application can just make regular TCP 
connections.
  3. Punch a hole, abusing the router's NAT routing rules in order to get 
it to think it's making a connection when it is actually accepting one. 
There are about six different ways to do this, but you can do it with 
UDP *or* TCP.  Different routers support different schemes, and I don't 
just mean "some support TCP, some support UDP": UDP port mapping 
_usually_ works a certain way, but there are exceptions.  You should at 
least read the papers referenced here:  http://midcom- 
p2p.sourceforge.net/

In order to build a truly robust application you will need to do all of 
the above.  Even if you do #2 and #3 perfectly, there are a surprising 
percentage of home routers (say, 5-10%) which are just buggy and won't 
route your traffic properly to another NAT no matter what you do, so you 
always need to provide a "just tell the NAT what to do manually" option. 
(Or, forward your traffic through some known-to-work intermediary.)

TCP will, in general, "perform" better than UDP, because TCP can cheat 
whereas UDP can't.  Your ISP can (and probably does, according to rumors 
I've heard from people who have worked on such things) deploy "smart" 
routers which can prioritize traffic using the additional information 
present in TCP headers which UDP doesn't provide.  Plus, there are 
things that your operating system is doing (as James already mentioned) 
that are extensions to the core TCP spec.

If you don't understand _at least_ enough about TCP to have implemented 
it yourself once, then you probably don't understand enough to make the 
decision to use UDP for performance reasons.  I am saying this because 
it was at the point where I actually implemented TCP myself that I 
gained this insight :).

I started a project a while ago to try to abstract away all this NAT- 
traversal nonsense and present an API for making a connection to a peer- 
to-peer user over whatever methods are available.  It's definitely in 
need of some maintenance, but if you're already using Twisted I think 
you'll find it easier to get started with this than to build your own 
P2P framework from the ground up:

Good luck!

Hello everyone,

I have written an application that has one server and multiple clients 
using twisted. I would need to be able to install/run it under windows 
(for now) as an executable or a service. I can't have to have to install 
python and all the deps, this needs to be a drag-n-drop-n-execute-it-n- 
it-works deal, sort of like apple "app" files. I personally run each 
service (client) and the server as a diff. process as using twistd with 
one tac file seems slower. One of the services has a wx GUI too. Does 
anyone have any pointers/ideas/links concerning this? I saw that py2exe 
and freeze exists, but from the mailing list archives I couldn't tell it 
it really works.

Thank you,
Gabriel

I would probably try to use py2exe, possibly with moonfallen's ntsvc code
here:

That should at least get you started.

Hello,

I'm just starting to use twisted (having quickly read through the book  
"Twisted: Network Programming Essentials"), and I am unable to  
successfully use one of the example scripts:  doc/conch/examples/

I have tried starting the client both as 'ssh localhost -p 5022' as  
well as running the sshsimpleclient.py script with the same results.

I have also tried connecting from a different host into the server,

Any help in resolving this issue and realizing a working example of an

This looks a lot like a bug in PyCrypto:

This is a file in PyCrypto itself, calling a method in PyCrypto itself,
and passing the wrong arguments.

You might want to try using the last release of PyCrypto instead of the
latest development snapshot.  You might also want to file a bug with the
PyCrypto maintainer (it seems there's a new one now) to get this fixed.

I did revert to 2.0.1 and the problem did go away.

I will file a bug report to the PyCrypto guy.

You can find the API documentation for failures here:

  http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.failure.Failure.html

You might be interested in the printTraceback method.  You can also
pass a failure to twisted.python.log.err and a traceback will be written.

Keep in mind, however, that not all failures have tracebacks.  If you try
printing a failure's traceback and don't see anything interesting, this
may be because the failure wasn't created with a traceback.  In this case,
running with failure debugging enabled (eg, with twistd --debug) may provide
more useful information, since it will set a breakpoint on failure creation,
letting you inspect the creation context.

Hi!

I am writing some code which requires synchronization between several
TCP clients. I have several connections and at some point I have to
wait for data becoming availiable from several of them. Kind of
"barrier" pattern. I am twising my head how to do it with twisted
using reactor. Could somebody point me into right direction? Thanks!

You might want twisted.internet.defer.gatherResults().  It accepts a
list of Deferreds and returns a Deferred that fires when they all fire.

Jean-Paul,

Thanks! Seems like what I need. The only thing missing is ability to  
specify
timeout parameters, how long to wait for deferred to fire.

Sincerely,
Vadim

since gatherResults won't block you can implement your own timeout
with callLater.

Pardon my naive questions, but how I can easily call gatherResults() to
wait for all deferred to fire and to return list of results in form of  
list
of (success,result) tuples?

Never mind. I have managed to do it in asynchronous manner, via  
callbacks.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] LoopingCall question : ping w/ timeout using
	shared variable -> problem
Message-ID: <48DB5AF3.1030300@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone!

I have written some code uses a LoopingCall to send a "ping" at regular 
intervals. If it hasn't received an answer before the next call, it 
notifies me that the destination isn't available, if it does then it 
does nothing. I am getting lots of "unavailables" on hosts that are, I 
tried augmenting the timeout (the ping interval) and it doesn't change 
anything. I think what is happening is I'm using a simple variable to 
keep the availability state and that since protocol and the 
LoopingCall's callback both access the variable, this causes problems. 
Is there a better way of doing things or am I bound to use some sort of 
locking mechanism? If I have to use locking, which one do you recommend?

Thank you,
Gabriel

I tried using a reactor.callLater call and if it fires then it notifies 
me (unavailable) and if I get the response I cancel it and start over, 
this seams like a better approach.

Message-ID: <48DCEE0E.7030708@arimaz.com>

Hello everybody,

I am trying to use py2exe with twisted, but I'm running into a problem : 
one of my classes uses twisted's plugin mechanism and they aren't 
loaded. I tried the python version and it works correctly. I saw that to 
use sqlite with storm I have to explicitly import it somewhere like so :

 import storm.databases.sqlite

because py2exe wasn't finding it since it's imported using __import__(), 
do I have to do something like that with twisted?

Thank you,
Gabriel

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Ampoule - 0.0.2
Message-ID: <8B49DB20-0642-4A7F-B7E6-B30A6EEF47A4@gmail.com>

I just released Ampoule 0.0.2 on pypi and launchpad

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ampoule/0.0.2
https://launchpad.net/ampoule/ampoule/0.0.2

Ampoule is a process pool implementation written
on top of Twisted Matrix. Its name comes from the
use of AMP as the default communication protocol
between the pool and all its children.

It's different from other alternative solutions because it
provides an API very close to that of the Twisted ThreadPool.
As an helper function it also provides a deferToAMPProcess
function that creates the ProcessPool and submits jobs to it.

The code is pretty well tested, in fact it contains more test lines
than actual code lines, and it's pretty well documented.

Speedwise on my macbook pro I was able to run about 1700 Ping
calls per second without recycling processes and about 1500 with
a recycling value of about 10000 calls per process.
If anyone wants to contribute a C implementation of amp
serializer/deserializer I'm pretty sure that Ampoule would benefit a
lot from it but for my current tasks 1500 calls per second is more
than fast enough, it's actually pretty fast.

A usage example is the following:

from ampoule import child, util
from twisted.protocols import amp

class Pid(amp.Command):
     response = [("pid", amp.Integer())]

class MyChild(child.AMPChild):
     @Pid.responder
     def pid(self):
         import os
         return {"pid": os.getpid()}

@util.mainpoint
def main(args):
     import sys
     from twisted.internet import reactor, defer
     from twisted.python import log
     log.startLogging(sys.stdout)

     from ampoule import pool

     @defer.inlineCallbacks
     def _run():
         pp = pool.ProcessPool(MyChild)
         yield pp.start()
         result = yield pp.doWork(Pid)
         print "The Child process PID is:", result['pid']
         yield pp.stop()
         reactor.stop()

     reactor.callLater(1, _run)
     reactor.run()

What's new in this version:

Ampoule 0.0.2 (2008-09-26)
==========================

Features
--------
  - Support process recycling after predefined number of calls.

Changes
-------
  - ProcessPool argument max_idle is now maxIdle to comply with Twisted
    style guidelines.

  - removed ampoule.runner module because it was essentially useless,
    if you want to change subprocess startup behavior pass a string that
    contains the new code as an argument by overriding the default
    processFactory for example with a closure like this:

        from ampoule.main import startAMPProcess
        from ampoule.pool import ProcessPool
        pp = ProcessPool()
        def myProcessFactory(*args, **kwargs):
            kwargs['bootstrap'] = myBootstrapCode
            return startAMPProcess(*args, **kwargs)
        pp.processFactory = staticmethod(myProcessFactory)

Have fun with ampoule! :)

Take a look at the API docs and the examples.  Perhaps get a copy of
_Twisted Network Programming Essentials_ or find the Conch chapter
online.  If you get stuck, come back with specific questions.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Syslog Listener UDP
Message-ID: <a33934630809281118y34e23dfdq769c5ea2ab8e9acd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to build a syslog(udp port 514) listener in twisted.  The goal
is to make it compatible with syslog and syslog-ng, which may be configured
on a "client" to send log entries (as they occur) via udp (fire and forget)
to a remote server (my twisted server).

Is there already something out there that would do this or that would be a
good start?

Thanks,


Marc

Because  of the  simplicity of  the syslog  protocol, you  can  just use
UDPServer with  a protocol derived from DatagramProtocol.  You just need
to overload datagramReceived to do  something sensible with the log line
received.

In short:

class SyslogInput(protocol.DatagramProtocol):

      def datagramReceived(self, data):
          print "I have received %r" % data

service = internet.UDPServer(514, SyslogInput())

Hope this isn't too offensive but last time I checked conch didn't work 
on win32 (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/50). I guess most users 
would be happy with a basic "secure RPC" implementation, no console 
stuff. No idea how much work that is though ...

Ticket 50 is about the conch command line client.  I'm not sure if the
rest of conch, the part you would use to automate an SSH login, works on
Windows or not.  It shouldn't be affected by the lack of an fcntl module
(or any of the other modules missing on Windows), but it may accidentally
import them, preventing the code from working out of the box, even though
it doesn't use them.  This is probably simpler to fix than actually writing
a command line client.  However, it may already work; I don't have a Windows
machine handy to try, but by looking at buildbot I can see that a significant
portion of the Conch test suite runs and passes on there.

There could be a few things that could not be happening. Do you have the
correct username and password?
Do you have the correct server? Does the server use srv records?

If you have the ability you can check your xmpp server logs to see if it
connected.

For a non-twisted solution, you can also try paramiko:
http://www.lag.net/paramiko/

It might be a bit easier to wrap your brain around if you are very new to
the twisted way of doing things.

It should also work nicely on Win32 (I haven't checked in a while but the
last time I used it it worked fine).

Message-ID: <200809292237.28827.esteve@fluidinfo.com>

Hi all,

I'm pleased to announce that Fluidinfo [1] is releasing support for Twisted in 
Apache/Facebook Thrift [2]

Download from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-148

We hope to get it accepted into the Thrift core, but in the meantime you can 
apply the patch. There's also a simple example based on the Thrift calculator 
demo.

To add support for Twisted in a Thrift service, simply run "thrift --gen 
py:twisted specfile.thrift" from the command line. For more details, you can 
follow the calculator example, as it covers Thrift extensively.

Feedback and contributions will be greatly appreciated! :-)

Cheers.

PS: the JIRA web page lets you vote issues, so just show your support if you 
think this patch is useful :-)

Conch does work on Win32, I have written an application that uses
it (not the command line client). You have to install pycrypto 
in addition to Twisted.

Message-ID: <6bea62950809291511r76a43d4fi117231d9c6455f61@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,I try to use twisted for asynchronous serial port read().

Here is my simple twisted code:
==========================
from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.internet.serialport import SerialPort
from twisted.internet.protocol import Protocol

class Client(Protocol):
    def connectionMade(self):
        print 'connected'

    def dataReceived(self, data):
        print data

SerialPort(Client(), 'COM4', reactor)
reactor.callLater(20, reactor.stop())
reactor.run()

==========================

It runs on my Mac with this line changed to SerialPort(Client,
'dev/tty.usbserial-A4001mLL', reactor) which is my Arduino board device.

But on Windows XP, it gave the error message:
"AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'addEvent' "

I tried to used different reactor, such as selectreactor, win32eventreactor,
but the error message became "AssertionError: reactor already installed"

Please help. Thanks

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Question on default t.p.log output
Message-ID: <18658.8510.659765.567315@jon.es>

Greetings Twisted superheroes!

I have a simple question about logging. Here's a snippet of code:

    from twisted.python import log
    from twisted.web import client
    from twisted.internet import reactor
    import sys

    log.startLogging(sys.stdout)
    def stop(x): reactor.callLater(0, reactor.stop)
    client.getPage('http://www.divmod.com').addBoth(stop)
    reactor.run()

This produces the output

    2008/09/30 14:16 +0200 [-] Log opened.
    2008/09/30 14:16 +0200 [-] Starting factory <HTTPClientFactory: http://www.divmod.com>
    2008/09/30 14:16 +0200 [HTTPPageGetter,client] Stopping factory <HTTPClientFactory: http://divmod.com/?__session_just_started__=1>
    2008/09/30 14:16 +0200 [-] Main loop terminated.

I had a look around and can see where (most) of this is coming from.

First off, the start/stop factory messages are surprising and feel ugly to
me. I mean that's my stdout you're scribbling that stuff all over. The
starting and stopping factory methods, despite appearing next to each other
in the same base Factory class, don't give the same [...] component in
their output. Sometimes I get [Uninitialized], sometimes [-], and sometimes
[HTTPPageGetter,client] as above - with both starting and stopping
messages.

And then, and misleading IMO, is that in a callback attached to the
deferred from getPage, the log output (to the uninitiated, a class I am
arguably a prime member of) still appears to have something to do with
HTTPPageGetter,client when in fact the page has been retrieved, and the
callback fired. It's like HTTPPageGetter,client refuses to lie down and die
quietly, and insists on sitting up in the casket to holler at its
ungrateful descendant callbacks: Hey, I'm the one that kicked this off and
don't you forget it!

Ahem. I see that output is controlled by a var called noisy in the base
Factory class. By why is it True by default if it really is just noise?
Judging from the code (and the use of log.msg not log.err) it's not an
error.

In my actual use case, I see my log filling up with output like this:

2008/09/29 23:55 +0200 [HTTPPageGetter,client] Stopping factory <HTTPClientFactory: https://ec2.amazonaws.com:443/?Action=RunInstances&AWSAccessKeyId=92383292629273839262&ImageId=ami-6bd03402&InstanceType=m1.small&KeyName=xxx-keypair&MaxCount=1&MinCount=1&SecurityGroup.1=coordinator&SignatureVersion=1&Timestamp=2008-09-29T21%3A55%3A23&UserData=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%3D&Version=2008-05-05&Signature=mPRws2HDxQaF4lMcmL7Ikc8Txqo%3D>

I guess the answer might be that I should make my own version of getPage
that sets noisy to False after making its HTTPClientFactory, or maybe
subclass FileLogObserver and override emit. Or I guess I could be calling
functions with log.callWithContext.

But those approached seem to be wheeling in a lot of machinery just to set
to False a variable that (arguably?) should be False to begin with.

See - told you it was simple. I'm at my very best nibbling away on the very
edges of the Twist-o-verse.

Thank you for at least noticing this ;-).

The logging code is quite ugly, but unfortunately, almost nobody cares. 
If you could dedicate any time at all to improving it, even a little, 
we'd all really appreciate it.

The way the log prefix is calculated is based on what actual event is 
firing from the reactor.  So, whatever object *generates* the callback 
is the one whose log prefix will be used.

It would definitely be nice if the log could follow the asynchronous 
thread of execution.  Patches accepted :).

It sounds like you have several complaints here.

1.) You don't want logs to go to stdout.

This is easy.  You can direct the log wherever you want, and overriding 
stdout is optional; take a look at the arguments to startLogging. 
(Unless you're talking about customizing logging in twistd, which is a 
whole other mess that there is a universe of tickets for.)

2.) Factories are too noisy by default.

Knowing when factories start up and shut down can actually be incredibly 
useful.  It's a pain when they're filling up your logs with spam, but a 
better solution would be some kind of structured log format with a log 
viewer application, not destroying the information so that viewing logs 
with 'less' is easier.

3.) Factories' start and stop messages do not include useful 
information.

Quite so.  It would be nicer if they did.

4.) The log prefix isn't always useful or correct.

This may be true, but we'd need a ticket filed that includes a complete 
enumeration of exactly _how_ they aren't useful or correct, and each 
case would need to be fixed.

5.) The log prefix for Deferred callbacks doesn't follow the 
asynchronous origin of the callback.

Figuring out how to do this is really tricky, because in different cases 
you want different things.  However, twisted.python.context provides a 
hook for you to potentially capture some state when Deferreds, at least 
certain Deferreds, are spun up.  If you can come up with a really clear 
statement of requirements for a particular log prefix, you can probably 
get it.

6.) The HTTP client is too noisy and should emit fewer log messages.

Possibly - but then I recently discovered some very interesting 
information by watching a server which had a bunch of outstanding 
getPage connections spew out thousands of 'stopping factory' messages in 
their output - and seeing those URLs was an invaluable debugging aid.

7.) Twisted's log messages are generally ugly and difficult to 
understand.

Touche - but again, this needs to be fixed on a case-by-case basis; 
nothing to be done in general.  Except, of course, to come up with some 
kind of standard for what makes up a useful / helpful log message; and 
that's probably not going to be the unstructured mess of strings that 
currently goes into the log.  (Can you tell I'm pushing a structured log 
format that can be parsed?)

Please feel free to file some tickets for areas of this behavior that 
you have noticed.  I wish I had time to pour into the logging system, 
but neither I (nor any of our sponsors) _really_ needs it to be any 
better; it's just a constant annoyance.

You'd all appreciate it but OTOH almost nobody cares??? Hmmm. Hard to
resist :-)

But I also see lines like this:

2008/09/29 23:56 +0200 [-] Starting factory <HTTPClientFactory: http://ec2-75-101-219-127.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8001/dummy>

And - and Uninitialized do not have any clear correspondence with reactor
events. (BTW, I do see where these are coming from.)

glyph> It would definitely be nice if the log could follow the asynchronous 
glyph> thread of execution.  Patches accepted :).

Yes, agreed that would be nice. From my memory of defer.py... (insert vague
comment about how this might not be so hard - for you :-)).

glyph> It sounds like you have several complaints here.

glyph> 1.) You don't want logs to go to stdout.

I do want that, that's why I used sys.stdout.

glyph> 2.) Factories are too noisy by default.

glyph> Knowing when factories start up and shut down can actually be incredibly

Right, and so viewing them when running a script from the command line that
wants to do some logging to stdout is also fine.

glyph> 4.) The log prefix isn't always useful or correct.

glyph> This may be true, but we'd need a ticket filed that includes a

OK, thinking about that.

And this.

OK, but by your own description that's output that's useful for debugging
(and above you call it spam). My only real question was why that output is
on by default instead of off (especially seeing as it's often adding 1K of
output to my log file for a single logged message).

glyph> 7.) Twisted's log messages are generally ugly and difficult to 
glyph> understand.

glyph> Touche

But I didn't say that... I'm very happy to not have to write logging
code. Sure, the [HTTPPageGetter,client] speaking from beyond the grave is a
bit unsettling, but that's minor.

glyph> Except, of course, to come up with some kind of standard for what

Understood, thanks. I'm mainly just trying to understand what's going on
and why.

I will have a bit more of a poke around. As I was going to say, from what I
remember about the callback mechanism in defer.py it seems like one should
be able to have some kind of data structure that's being maintained
(pushed, popped) there that could be updating a log prefix in some way.

Thanks!

Hello all,

Here's a summary of what Chris Armstrong, Itamar Shtull-Trauring,
and myself accomplished this past Sunday at the Twisted sprint.

Itamar took turns pairing with Chris and I.  He and Chris worked on
creating command line tools to invoke the release automation libraries
which we've already written.  You can find the results in a branch linked
from ticket #3439.

Itamar and I (and later Chris and I) worked on providing improved support
in Trial for inspecting warnings which have been emitted over the course
of a test.  This is in support of the high-level deprecation API described
in ticket #3266.

hi friends thanks for immediate reply.
i have referred the book twisted..........
currently i am facing the problem.
i have to show ls -l output in a listbox using Tkinter
but because of TCP it first stores information in a window or some packet
format.
so it doesnot show the output in a continuous manner.

Message-ID: <8cc9d3030809300906u1db77d9ag2abb2e5257ab6a57@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I have written a python program that executes shell scripts on remote
computers using the twisted conch SSHChannel. Several shell scripts
are executed at once on several machines and the scripts range in
execution time from minutes to hours.

My question is regarding the behavior of Conch when it is shut down.
What i would like to do is to send a SIGINT or SIGKILL to the remote
script so that it can terminate in an orderly fashion. I am using the
channel.SSHChannel as a base class for my task. Is there a mechanism
in Conch for sending this signal?

best regards

frans

That's particularly good timing for me, because I'm going to be taking

Message-ID: <48BB9F60.4000209@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone,

Just a little question about Twistd & the Application framework. I'm 
using the service collection app mechanism
and I was wondering how Twistd handles it. Is there anything special to 
watch out for? Any differences in between running each server as a
separate process (i.e. launching it from a diff term without twistd) and 
with Twistd? Does it spawn a process for each Service/Server?

Thank you,
Gabriel

twistd runs all services in a single process.  In fact, twistd only runs 
one service.  Although that service may be a MultiService which contains 
other services, MultiService does not do anything special to run things 
in other processes either.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] create new domish.Element from string XML
Message-ID: <48BCFAB9.2070203@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone,

I sometimes have to create domish.Element from a string and I can't find 
any way of doing this. I saw that I can add children from a string but 
not create a whole XML tree.
Is there a way of doing this other than creating a dummy element, adding 
the XML string as a child and then extracting the child?

Thank you,
Gabriel

I tried creating a dummy element, adding the raw string as a child using 
"addRawXml()" and then extracting the first child, and this does not 
work because the raw xml string is just added without being parsed. I 
write this up, if anybody is interested, that does what I need. If a 
better method exists, please tell me.

This doesn't really have anything to do with pollreactor.  Any reactor 
that implements IReactorFDSet can monitor a pipe.

It was easier for me to implement this than to explain what to do, so 
here's the code for monitoring a named pipe for read, given its name. 
I'm pretty sure it's not 100% correct, but if you want to read about 
handling I/O events from fifos on your platform, you are welcome to do 
so.

    import os
    from twisted.internet.abstract import FileDescriptor
    from twisted.internet.main import CONNECTION_DONE

    class FIFODescriptor(FileDescriptor):
        def __init__(self, reactor, fifoname, protocol):
            FileDescriptor.__init__(self, reactor)
            self.fifo = os.open(fifoname, os.O_NONBLOCK | os.O_RDONLY)
            self.protocol = protocol
            self.protocol.makeConnection(self)

        def connectionLost(self, reason):
            self.protocol.connectionLost(reason)

        def doRead(self):
            data = os.read(self.fifo, 1024)
            if data:
                self.protocol.dataReceived(data)
            else:
                self.stopReading()
                self.connectionLost(CONNECTION_DONE)

        def fileno(self):
            return self.fifo


And here's a brief program that uses it:

    import sys
    from twisted.internet import reactor
    from twisted.internet.protocol import Protocol
    class PrintingProtocol(Protocol):
        def dataReceived(self, data):
            print 'data', repr(data)
        def connectionMade(self):
            print 'hi'
        def connectionLost(self, reason):
            print 'bye', reason
    fifd = FIFODescriptor(reactor, sys.argv[1], PrintingProtocol())
    fifd.startReading()
    reactor.run()

I tested this by doing 'mkfifo x; python fifo.py x', and in another 
terminal, 'cat > x'.  It should be pretty self-explanitory.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] license / copyright questions about Twisted
	Perspective Broker client
Message-ID: <48BD4C51.6030303@gmail.com>

Hi,
After looking around for the last 6 months for an Actionscript 3 library 
that would work as a client for use with Twisted Perspective Broker
, and hoping someone more skilled than myself would get around to 
creating one, I decided to get the ball rolling.

It currently works as a client for the example here.
http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/pb-cred.html#auto18

There is a long way to go. . . but it's a start.

I aim to release the library under the same license as Twisted (MIT) but 
I'm wondering about some of the details.
Since all I have done is just ported the original Twisted code from 
Python to Actionscript what does that mean in terms of copyright and 
credits ?
Should I give credit in every file according to original author ?
I still have most of the original doc strings in my version - am I 
allowed to use those ?
There are also sections where I have the original python code commented 
out (as a guide to what still needs to done). I can't really be arsed to 
delete all that while it's still in heavy development. Is that a problem 
? Would I have to put the credits for the code in each snippet ?

I have created a Google code project and will get the code up there as 
soon as I have got the paperwork in order.
Cheers,
Al.

I don't feel like analyzing a work today to determine whether it is a
derivative of Twisted, but if you think it is and you want to comply
with being a derivative, all you need to do is include the Twisted
copyright notice.

Hmmm, this code worked when I posted it, and it no longer does... maybe 
the interpreter I was testing it in had an old version cached, but now 
it tells me that "result" is None when "onElement" is called, what I 
don't get is that a clusure should have been created with those internal 
functions, no? When "DocumentStartEvent" is called, It does set 
"result", but when "ElementEvent" is called, "result" no longer exists. 
Does anyone know what's going on?

Thank you,
Gabriel

Twisted-8.1.0. This is with python 2.5.

On version 8 of twisted, a 0-byte file is created and the client never
finished; but with version 2.5, the full file is transferred.

What am I doing wrong; or is this a bug?

Thanks all,

-Samson

Hey all,

I wanted to take a quick moment to share some stuff with the general
email audience that is interested in XMPP/Jabber in Twisted.

First off, some folks don't realize that there is a dedicated
Twisted-Jabber email list for discussing XMPP/Jabber topics. This list
is managed by Twisted's XMPP guru, Ralph Meijer. You can subscribe and
check out the archives here:
  https://mailman.ik.nu/mailman/listinfo/twisted-jabber

Secondly, we've been having some interesting discussions with Twisted
sponsors lately about deep and abiding interests in Twisted XMPP: many
sponsors want us to spend time creating docs and tutorials, improving
support and adding new features. This interest was spearheaded by Jack
Moffitt of Chesspark and given additional momentum by Dhris DiBona of
Google. Furthermore, we've received vocal support for XMPP
improvements from Hydra Labs, Lucasfilm, Security Metrics, and
individual sponsors.

Thirdly, today on #twisted, we had an intense and very productive
discussion about XMPP in general, about it's current support in
Twisted, and then a provisional roadmap for future developments. It
was an excellent experience for all, and one that can be relived by
everyone, thanks to IRC logs :-) A new ticket was created to address
the next step that will to be taken, and that ticket is here:
  http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3407

In that ticket, I linked to the notes and IRC log of our chat:
  http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/XMPPServerArchitecture
  http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/XMPPIRCTranscript20080903

There's lots to do and we're all quite excited about both the
immediate and long-term benefits to be had by Twisted users, community
members, and the project itself with regard to XMPP and messaging
development efforts.

Thanks,

d

Given that it's got such little traffic, maybe it's proven to not be a
good idea to have that mailing list separate from this one. It hides
the conversation that goes on there from a larger audience, and anyone
who reads the archives is going to think that the project is, if not
dead, not very active.

+1 for Twisted XMPP discussions on Twisted Python, at least until the
XMPP code in Twisted is so great and popular that we start getting the
kind of repetitive, uninteresting posts that led to the twisted-web
split.

This is really great. We've been using Twisted-XMPP that acts as a Mobile IM
server (now taking 5k simultaneous connections). I'd be glad to share some
of the experiences and help out with with the development.

Agreed. When I did some work recently to implement the client side of 
pubsub, I found that mailing list moribund and gave up on the idea of 
asking for help there.

Hey Phil,

that sounds nice. Have you looked at all at the stuff that currently 
resides in Wokkel (and, as part of this grand effort will eventually end 
up in Twisted Words)? The pubsub protocol there is the stuff I've been 
working on most. I mostly focused on the component side (for 
implementing Idavoll), but there is good client support in there as 
well. You can also drop me a line via Jabber.

That said, yeah the list might have been somewhat quiet, partly because 
I have been bad at communicating what I've been up to recently. It does 
have about 50 people subscribing to it, and I am so far not convinced 
that all of them would want to be dragged into general Twisted discussions.

I did look at wokkel. I must be honest, first time round I found it a 
bit difficult to decipher, though that might be because it took a while 
to realise that lots of the pieces were in fact server-side ;o)

Once I'd gone to the effort of re-inventing the wheel however, a 2nd 
look back at wokkel made a lot more sense, and I'll certainly use it 
instead of the code I wrote.

The actual project was for ESB-like use, though that's now been put on 
hold (frankly I think XMPP pubsub might be a little new for that, and 
will probably look at ActiveMQ. It didn't help that ejabberd's 
collections are "funny").

What I *did* end up doing was start on a basic Nevow/Athena XMPP client 
with basic roster/message functions and also pubsub support. That might 
make a nice example app.

The notion of an all-twisted XMPP server is intriguing, especially if 
some integration with http://pypi.python.org/pypi/txLoadBalancer were to 
appear!

Thinking about it, you're probably right - the list has been quiet 
because not much has been going on, but that doesn't mean it need remain 
quiet if things are now going to be moving.

I agree with Chris and JP here: I certainly plan to discuss XMPP issues 
here on the main Twisted mailing list.  I _want_ to "drag" these folks 
into general Twisted discussions - and with over 1000 people on this 
list already, with a hugely divergent array of interests in Twisted, 
somehow I am guessing those 50 won't need to be dragged too hard :).

There is still a lot to be decided as to how Twisted's XMPP code will 
integrate with the rest of Twisted: what is the (protocol-agnostic) 
common domain model for chat?  How should different XMPP components and 
modules use twisted.cred?  I think that these core integration 
mechanisms are a huge part of what makes Twisted great.  These questions 
need to be answered by people who know Twisted's abstractions as well as 
those who know XMPP's.

What to do with the twisted-jabber mailing list is certainly up to you, 
and perhaps current discussion of wokkel, palaver, and idavoll does not 
belong here; but certainly development of twisted.words should be 
discussed in as general a forum as possible.

Phil, you're reading my mind :-) That's just the sort of thing I have

Hey Henrik,

Thanks for sharing!

I would, however, encourage you to create a Paisley branch in
Launchpad and improve the error handling and connection abstraction
there. This would make it much easier for us to merge your changes
into Paisley.

At the very least, you may want to register your project with
Launchpad and associate it with the tx project group, so people can
find it easily (the tx project group, or "super project" is for
Twisted community code).

Also, are you aware that web2 features are being slowly ported to web,
and that twisted.web will continue to be the official web library?

Thanks again!

Changing the connection abstraction and error handling in paisley would make
it extremely similar to couched. The main difference would be the name :-).

I might do it.

Btw. I've created a second release of couched which supports views and
probably fixes a few other things. Just forgot to release it. Couched was
mainly an exercise in understanding the CouchDB interface.

I'm aware that something might or might not happen in the twisted web world
:-).

<begin twisted web rant which would be much better suited for twisted-web>
Frankly I've given up following the web vs. web2 discussions. I used web2 as
it is what I am familiar with, and I wanted connection caching. I have a
significant code base using web2 and beside a few issues (for which I've
submitted patches and bugs, but nothing happens) it works fine, though I
have to maintain a patchset for it :-/. Twisted web is currently not an
option (I need request pipelining and http 1.1).

Hello everyone,

I am trying to figure out how the auth works, for this I used the simple

output I never see the username being sent, I see the server at some 
point sending it to me.

Thank you,

Ok, I thought that was the password, and that something maybe wasn't

We're trying to use twisted as a sort of bus, a centralized place to manage all of our SOA enpoints (mostly through XML-RPC). We have a few services that access the Oracle DB directly (adbapi). In production we're getting intermittent ConnectionLost exceptions from cx_Oracle. Most of these are queries that take a couple of seconds.

Has anyone seen this kind of behavior before? What we're probably going to do in the short term is just remove twisted from the equation for these methods that seem to be timing out. But we're relatively new to twisted and I wonder if we're doing something that's obviously wrong.

Hi Henrik,

Patches to Paisley would be greatly appreciated.

Please file tickets about making twisted.web support the HTTP/1.1  
features you need, this is the best way to get that support into  
Paisley.

It just saddens me to see a 3rd couchdb python client library spring  
up.  2 is bad enough but one being asynchronous and one being  
synchronous means it can't really be helped.  Paisley development  
hasn't stopped it just hasn't really needed much work.

Hmm, it is kind of hard to say what the problem could be, without
seeing the code that is using adbapi and cx_Oracle.

When you say you are receiving ConnectionLost exceptions from cx_Oracle,
are they *really* from cx_Oracle, i.e., "ORA-03135 - Connection lost...",
or are they just the result of adbapi calling its connectionLost method?

I've used cx_Oracle with twisted many times, with many different workloads,
including stored procedures with OUT parameters, and it has always worked
as expected.  If you are able to provide some code, this list might be
able to provide you with more prescriptive advice.

Hope this helps,

I looked at the adbapi code and it appears the ConnectionLost exception is coming from there, not from cx_Oracle. At least that's what is in the error log:

"exception caught here" is telling you where in the call stack the exception
was caught. Frames above it weren't escaped by the exception. Frames below
it were.

I think you're seeing an example of poor error reporting in adbapi.  This
has recently been improved and the improvements will be included in the
next release of Twisted.  If you can somehow test a recent trunk revision
of Twisted, you might find that it reports a more specific problem which
points to the actual cause of the failure.

What this does indicate, I think, is that you had a transaction which
could not be committed for some reason.  adbapi is rolling back the
transaction before reporting the reason the commit failed.  However,
the ConnectionLost exception, which is boring and not really relevant
to anything you're doing, is happening before the real exception can be
reported.

It seems that you have been a victim of at least one recently-fixed bug:

    http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3244

and at least one long-standing one:

    http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/1753

As you can see from the tone of my (unfortunate) comment on the latter 
ticket, I don't think a lot of people use Oracle with Twisted.

However, the issue is simple to hack around temporarily: set your 
ConnectionPool's "good_sql" attribute to 'select 1 from dual' as itamar 
suggests on #1753.

Then, please submit a patch, and ideally a buildslave with a copy of 
oracle installed so that we can maintain support for it :).

Hmm.  I was guessing about the most likely cause since the other (fixed) 
bug inhibits error reporting.

Do you get a more useful traceback out of twisted trunk at HEAD?  I 
wouldn't advocate using that in production, but the error-logging bugfix 
would tell you at least what's really going wrong.

This could be way off base, but i used to see this on stale
connections being  utilized again in the next xmlrpc job, basically
timing out. (mysqldb- Mysql Server has gone away). Using db.ping()
could keep them alive, or testing the connection/recreating before
executing a new xmlrpc job.

do these exceptions occur when they are running not through the xmlrpc.

By random chance I found the problem in this case.  Thanks for the

HTTP 1.1 status codes, notable 303 (see other). I could probably use 302,
but 303 is the "correct" behaviour for my case. This should be relatively
easy to implement.

Furthermore I need the server to support large uploads (last i checked the
640K limitation was still there) and downloads, and with reasonable
efficiancy.  I'm not saying streams are the answer but it works for me
(actually I use the producer/consumer interface in my lower level code and
then adapt it in the web layer). Unfortunately I've had to rewrite a lot of
the producer/consumer code and stream stuff and glue it together, as some of
the stuff in twisted (not just in web2) is rather broken. For complete
insanity (sorry to whoever wrote it ) see
twisted.protocols.basic.FileSender, which implements its own magic method
beginFileTransfer, which takes BOTH a file and a consumer as argument. This
makes is impossible to seperate the construction of the producer and
starting the transfer.

Ticket #1956 fixes some of these things. I'm not quite sure how it handles
errors (which can happen both ways), but I've just had a quick look. It's
been a whlie since i've had a look at all this. I write a bit about it,
which I've placed here: http://www.cs.aau.dk/~htj/prodcons.txt

IMHO, getting (and deciding on) a proper producer/consumer interface need to
happen, to make whatever web things twisted will have usefull. Changing the
producer/consumer might be massive API break, however it is a needed one.
There are simply things the current API cannot do (i usually return a
deferred along with any producer/consumer object to indiciate how the data
moving went). I might be interested in participating in this, however I'm
rather work struck as I have to hand my ph.d. thesis at the end of this
year.

Btw. I really am a huge fan of twisted, however the web and
producer/consumer is a rather dark spot in an otherwise bright world :-)

Will you accept a switch to web2, otherwise there is very little point to
it. Otherwise the patch kit needs to look like this:

Proper producer/consumer infrastructure in twisted
Integrate the above in twisted.web along with http 1.1 response codes, and
request pipelining.
Some patches to paisley, which would be quite small compared to the other.

Sorry, but it is not that simple :-)

Please file tickets about making twisted.web support the HTTP/1.1 features

See my response to JP.

Without getting into some large discussion here, I think that some diversity
is actually a good thing. Of course it is no use having several half
implementations lying around (the python community excels at this :-)), than
having a single working library. However. the interface of couchdb is simple
enough that a full client library can be written rather fast. This is not
sad, but very nice :-).

Please feel free to use twisted.web2 if it is meeting your needs 
currently.  However, our goal remains to focus maintenance effort on 
twisted.web and provide a gradual, compatible evolution to a better 
webserver.  The HTTP 1.1 features that you need will eventually be added 
to twisted.web, and I hope that the split with paisley can be resolved 
at that point.

I personally don't use couchdb or have any interest in its bindings, but 
it sounds like you have some other misconceptions about twisted and its 
development process which I'd like to correct.

640k limitation?  In twisted.web?  As far as I know there's no such 
thing; the only 640k limitation I know of anywhere in Twisted is in PB, 
and that's just on individual message size.  A brief skim through the 
twisted.web client and server code doesn't reveal any obvious size 
limitations that I can see.  (Is there some 640k limitation in the 'cgi' 
module?)

If there is such a limitation it should be more clearly documented 
somewhere.

True, twisted.web doesn't provide a graceful way for resources to handle 
streaming file uploads as they arrive, but for dedicated servers it is 
certainly *possible*; Request.handleContentChunk says it's "not for 
users", but you could easily write a few simple patches which would make 
it "for users", or just subclass it and ignore the docstring.  Nothing 
in twisted.web is really that hard to fix.

Ticket #1956 is still kind of stuck defining the problem.

If you have comments or thoughts on #1956, please feel free to add them 
as comments.  Text files lying around the web are not as helpful as 
discussions on tickets.

Your text file suffers from the same problems as the existing discussion 
on the ticket, though: a lack of concrete use-cases and example code. 
There are lots of proposed solutions but not a lot of proposed problems. 
(I am certainly a guilty party here, I really should describe the 
problem in more detail.)  We all feel there is some inelegance, but 
there is no example of some code that we can all agree is gross and 
would be fixed by some better API.

Please come up with an example - the shorter the better - of a 
deficiency in the streaming API and put it on the ticket.  Hopefully 
that will further the discussion there.

No.

1. We will never break compatibility with an API this old and this 
stable.  When we do start to move over to a new API, the transition will 
be particularly gradual and slow given the core nature of this API and 
the fact that pretty much everything uses it.  Even if it were only 
around for one release, see 
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CompatibilityPolicy

2. It's not clear what the new API would be.  Every suggestion proposed 
thus far has some issues, and there's no clear winner.  Unless someone 
takes the time to really thoroughly explain the problem and describe 
what effect the solution would have, with examples, then we're not going 
to make any progress.

3. There isn't anything that you *can't do* with 
ITransport/IProducer/IConsumer/IProtocol.  It can be slightly awkward 
sometimes, but I have yet to see an example where you really can't make 
something work.  For example, IConsumer doesn't have .finish(), but 
that's fine, because you probably mean IProtocol.connectionLost(...) 
anyway.  Some users of these interfaces don't provide nice ways to get 
data in and out, and yes, a uniform and consistent way to deal with 
slinging data between endpoints (for example, a standard, featureful 
object to remix a 'protocol' into a 'transport' and vice versa) would 
probably help with that.  Given that the deficiency creates momentary 
inconveniences rather than impossibilities, there's no way we're going 
to break *every single twisted program ever* just to make it slightly 
more convenient.

4. Given that the semantics are already there, it will be very easy to 
evolve new code to call old interfaces, provide adapters which wrap 
around things and generally make it easy to have some hypothetical shiny 
new interface cooperate just fine with the crufty old ones.

You can try to use Nginx with the upload module
http://www.grid.net.ru/nginx/upload.en.html

The upload module parse the multipart/form-data entity body, and saves 
all file fields to temporary files.

The backend server receive a multipart/form-data entity body where each 
file field is replaced with several fields: *_name, *_content_type, 
*_file_name, *_tmp_path (names are configurable).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] intermittent problem: not accepting new connections
Message-ID: <043501c91384$4c2c6b00$e4854100$@com>

I have had a twisted epoll server that was heavily used, such that it
saturated CPU (100% shown by "top", about 5000 connections, intense message
relaying).
I am using twisted 2.5.0 that I patched for epoll bug.
It was run on python 2.4.4 , 2.6.11 kernel on a single core xeon 3.0 GHz
CPU. This server has been on for many months, and it has been rock-stable.

A couple of days ago I migrated that server to a newer machine: same patched
twisted 2.5.0, same python 2.4.4, newer 2.6.24 kernel and a quad core xeon
L5420 CPU. 
CPU usage dropped from 100% to 30%, as expected, with the same rate of
client connections.

However the server now has the following intermittent problem: about twice a
day, it stops accepting new connections for a short period of 5-10 minutes.

telnet times out, I get this:
root at serv2:/proc/net/netfilter# telnet localhost 5229

Trying 127.0.0.1...

Existing connections are not cut, they server receives/delivers messages
to/from them just fine.
These short periods of not accepting connections do not correlate with
increased CPU load or with the overall number of connections to the server.

I have had a problem with the same symptoms before, when a server process
run out of its quota of file descriptors.
However, there were clear messages in the twisted log at that time, and
upping the ulimits solved the problem.
This time, there are no errors in ANY logs (twisted log. /var/log/messages,
etc)

I am out of ideas on what this could be, because my setup is exactly the
same as I have been using in the last year, except for a faster CPU and a
newer kernel?

I suspect that there are some new uncaught accept() exceptions in
internet/tcp.py in the part where it's looking for EMFILE, ENOBUFS, ENFILE,
ENOMEM, ECONNABORTED errors.

Do non-error log messages continue to appear in the Twisted log?  ie, is
it clear that the logging system is still working, or could it have failed
in some way, obscuring any exception reports?

Any new unhandled errno values should definitely result in an exception
being logged (notice that the `raise´ which follows the checks for
various errno values is inside a try/except which logs any exception).

Yes, I print the results of garbage collection every 10 min like this:

print "number of objects tracked by the garbage collector is:", len(gc.get_objects())

and they appear in the main twisted log.

2008/09/10 13:21 -0700 [-] number of objects tracked by the garbage collector is: 860021
2008/09/10 13:31 -0700 [-] number of objects tracked by the garbage collector is: 864316

I noticed that raise too... Could it then be EWOULDBLOCK, EAGAIN or EPERM?

                except socket.error, e:
                    if e.args[0] in (EWOULDBLOCK, EAGAIN):
                        self.numberAccepts = i
                        break
                    elif e.args[0] == EPERM:
                        # Netfilter on Linux may have rejected the
                        # connection, but we get told to try to accept()
                        # anyway.
                        continue


I am not sure how to debug this problem- I have another twisted server of a different type on that machine, and while the problematic server stops accepting connections, the second one works just fine, so this is not a machine-wide issue.
What could it be?

You could try running strace against the server while it's not accepting
connections.  You can limit the output to just accept calls, too:

   strace -p <pid> -etrace=accept

Maybe this will show you that accept calls are happening but failing in
some way.  If it produces no output, you can widen it and see if you can
tell what the server is doing if it isn't calling accept().

I have one short question before I try strace on live:

I have been playing with strace this morning on my dev, and I observe that for every second connection, there are two accept calls, one is success and one is a failure:

1st connection:

accept(9, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(33375), sin_addr=inet_addr("10.14.0.2")}, [16]) = 22
(client disconnects)

2nd connection:
accept(9, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(33519), sin_addr=inet_addr("10.14.0.2")}, [16]) = 22
accept(9, 0xbfaada10, [16])             = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
(client disconnects)

3d connection:
accept(9, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(33375), sin_addr=inet_addr("10.14.0.2")}, [16]) = 22
(client disconnects)

4th connection:
accept(9, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(33519), sin_addr=inet_addr("10.14.0.2")}, [16]) = 22
accept(9, 0xbfaada10, [16])             = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
....
and so on.

What is the meaning of 
accept(9, 0xbfaada10, [16])             = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable) 
that occurs every second connection?

I'm pretty sure this is a consequence of a heuristic optimization in the
accept loop.  When one connection is successfully accepted, a counter is
incremented.  Whenever it tries to accept connections, it will try up to
the number of times indicated by the current value of the counter.  When
it fails to get a new connection, it drops the counter to the number of
connections it did accept.  So in a lot of cases, it's flipping back and
forth between 1 and 2 attempts.

The point of this is that if you're receiving lots of connection attempts,
it'd be faster to accept many of them at once instead of only accepting one
each time around the reactor loop.  It's not clear the current implementation
is the best way to implement this optimization, but at least the code is very
old and hasn't changed in quite a while, so it's probably not actually causing
any problems.

It went into this regime again tonight, and I captured strace.

A few remarks first:

The outage was brief, it lasted about 3 min. It did not correspond to the peak number of connections.
The application has several protocols (like manhole and various control ports), that are listening on different ports.
When the server stopped accepting connections on the main port (where external internet clients connect), telnet connection to manhole and control ports are still possible.
Also, I think when it is in this bad state, it does accept some external connections, maybe 50%.

Anyway, here's the strace in the bad state:

The only noticeable difference is the frequency of 
--- SIGCHLD (Child exited) @ 0 (0) ---
but it occurred in the normal state as well.
The server sends emails via child subprocesses, so I suspect Child exited may be due to that.

If that's the case, the strace output is identical, and I do not understand what's causing the problem at all.

Hi Alec

just wondering...

How does netstat look like?

We ran into problems resource wise with the number of open connections 
aka file descriptors per process and observed similar problems to yours, 
also by switching to a new server.

How does ulimit -a compare between old and new machine?

HTH, Werner

Not necessarily related to what you've described, but I'll share
something that's helped a good deal on my most-heavily hit twisted
servers. Presuming you're using Linux:

 echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_recycle


from http://lartc.org/howto/lartc.kernel.obscure.html :

"Enable fast recycling TIME-WAIT sockets. Default value is 1. It
should not be changed without advice/request of technical experts"

My expert advice: only use this on machines connected on a low-latency
LAN. It *will* break internet-facing interfaces. It halves the
constant used by the Nagle algorithm:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle's_algorithm

Kind regards,

This is somewhat interesting.  It suggests a potential problem which
I hadn't thought about before.  If you need to accept more than about
64k connections (not necessarily concurrent) in less than TIME-WAIT
seconds, you might run out of ports.  Anyone know what happens to new
connection attempts to a server in this condition?

Alec, any idea if your server could be getting into this state every
once in a while?  This is an appealing hypothesis, since it wouldn't
necessarily happen at peak connection time (but potentially shortly
after a peak), would resolve itself given a short period of time,
wouldn't necessarily prevent all new connection attempts, since old
TIME-WAIT sockets would be gradually timing out (so your other low-
volume servers might still appear to be working normally), wouldn't
interfere with already established connections, and might not change
the userspace-visible syscall behavior (depending on what Linux does
in this case, but I wouldn't be surprised if connection failures due
to this never showed up in an accept(2) result).

Why would you run out of ports? accept()ed sockets use the same port as 
the listen()ing socket.

Shortening TIME_WAIT just saves on kernel memory.

Uh yes, I guess that would be a fatal flaw in this hypothesis.  Woops. :)

ulimit is only higher on the new machine, I upped it. Also, from my

> How does netstat look like?

I have to wait for another outage tonight, to get more definite results on
this.
So far, I have had only one very brief outage at 7:46am
I was asleep, but I have some new data logged.
I have two servers, one on port 5222 (problematic one, let's call it serv1
), and one on 5228 (that has no problems, call it serv2 ).
I made a script that measures the number of connections on each type of
server respectively like this:

while [ 1 ]
do
 sleep 5
 netstat -ant | grep ESTABLISHED | awk '/:5228 /{a += 1}/:5222 /{b += 1} END
{print strftime(" %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S", systime(
))"   serv2: "a"   serv1: "b" total: "a+b }'
done

This is what happened around 7:46am (lines that have "+" in front indicate
anomaly):

Each server also reports the maximum numbers of authenticated connected
clients to the database.
Even though serv1 peaked at 07:44:46  at 4327 "ESTABLISHED" connections, the
number of normally authenticated clients in the database for this time
period is only 1100, which does not reflect this weird connections spike. 
Since I was asleep at 7:46am, I did not have a chance to investigate what
those connections actually were.

One thing that I noticed yesterday, that when server was in this condition,
telnet simply hang, as if no ACK packet was received back:

alecm at serv2 ~> telnet localhost 5222
Trying 127.0.0.1...

and nothing

This behavior or telnet seems to be unique to the case when ACK is not
received in the handshake, I verified that with tcpdump. To contrast that,
if nothing listens on the destination port for example, telnet gives:

alecm at serv2 ~> telnet localhost 50007
Trying 127.0.0.1...
telnet: connect to address 127.0.0.1: Connection refused
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused

which corresponds to RST packet that kernel returns in that case.
I tried to write a 5 line mucked up server with accept() not returning any
packets, and failed.

We had a similar problem like this, might as well share it with you guys:

Our Jabber server stopped taking in new connections due to our iptables at
some point in time (even lost some packets). We have an ip routing scheme
where ports 25,80,5223,10873 routed to 5222. Whenever this happens, we get
error error from our syslogs:

""ip_conntrack: table full, dropping packet"

http://support.imagestream.com/Resolving_ip_conntrack_table_full_Errors.html

Might as well check dmesg if you have something like this. What we did is
disable iptables and removed its kernel modules.

I'm trying to send a post request like so
 getPage('http://localhost/test/test/', method='POST' postdata='test=asdf')

But the server script doesnt get any post arguments.
I was looking at the code for web.client and cant see where im doing
wrong here.
Any ideas what might be the problem? I'm using an svn checkout of Twisted.

Use twisted.python.logfile.LogFile wirte log，Memory can not be released,
does anybody familiar with or encounter such a situation?

Environment: FREEBSD 6.3 RELEASE
twisted svn trunk today


Description of the problem
Use "TOP" command observe the used memory, memory first use the BUF, if
buf>111M, then don't use buf
and use WIRED, Wired to around 132 M， and then use Inact
If during the service  manually delete the generated file. Memory will be
released.
twisted.python.logfile.LogFile default  log file will be closed at 1 M size,
and re-open a file, how the file is closed， but the memory still not
released？

sorry for my poor english.. thank you

Try:
getPage('http://localhost/test/test/?test=asdf', method='POST' postdata='')

If you want to use postdata, you'll have to encode it yourself. AFAIK
there is no method for doing this in twisted.web. I've used the
following which is based on[1]:


def encode_multipart_formdata(fields, files, content_type=
'application/octet-stream'):
    """
    fields is a sequence of (name, value) elements for regular form fields.
    files is a sequence of (name, filename, value) elements for data to
be uploaded as files
    content_type is the contentype to send
    Return (content_type, body) ready for httplib.HTTP instance
    """
    BOUNDARY = '----------ThIs_Is_tHe_bouNdaRY_$'
    CRLF = '\r\n'
    L = []
    for (key, value) in fields:
        L.append('--' + BOUNDARY)
        L.append('Content-Disposition: form-data; name="%s"' % key)
        L.append('')
        L.append(value)
    for (key, filename, value) in files:
        L.append('--' + BOUNDARY)
        L.append('Content-Disposition: form-data; name="%s";
filename="%s"' % (key, filename))
        L.append('Content-Type: %s' % content_type)
        L.append('')
        L.append(value)
    L.append('--' + BOUNDARY + '--')
    L.append('')
    body = CRLF.join(L)
    content_type = 'multipart/form-data; boundary=%s' % BOUNDARY
    return content_type, body

This code makes it possible to also add files to the post.

I wanted to post that I solved the problem, and it's unrelated to Twisted.

I noticed that this server had sudden increases in the numbers of
ESTABLISHED connections in netstat, but not in the number of authenticated
connections reported by twisted to the database. These increases correlated
with the connection outages.
Creating a shell script that monitors the connection rate, and invoking
tcpdump and sorting/counting the source IPs when it increases, showed that
this server was pounded twice a day for 3-5min from a small set of IPs with
new connections at about 100 conns/sec, that sent some junk data (these
connections timed out in twisted, because that junk never contained my line
separator, and I am using LineOnlyReceiver protocol). This was hardly an
attack against my server, because this new server was assigned an IP that I
have never used before- I guess this is just an internet reality ;)

Even though this does not look like SYN attacks (few connections were in
SYN_RCVD state), for some reason enabling net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1 made
everything normal. When these bizarre connections began to pile uo, I
started seeing 
"possible SYN flooding on port 5222. Sending cookies."
in /var/log/messages , and the connectivity outages stopped

I am sorry for the confusion, I was emboldened by finding the epoll bug back
in April, but this time Twisted continues to rock, and it's just a stupid
Ubuntu's tcp setting.

We had a similar problem like this, might as well share it with you guys:

Our Jabber server stopped taking in new connections due to our iptables at
some point in time (even lost some packets). We have an ip routing scheme
where ports 25,80,5223,10873 routed to 5222. Whenever this happens, we get
error error from our syslogs:

""ip_conntrack: table full, dropping packet"

http://support.imagestream.com/Resolving_ip_conntrack_table_full_Errors.html

Might as well check dmesg if you have something like this. What we did is
disable iptables and removed its kernel modules.

I have to wait for another outage tonight, to get more definite results on
this.
So far, I have had only one very brief outage at 7:46am
I was asleep, but I have some new data logged.
I have two servers, one on port 5222 (problematic one, let's call it serv1
), and one on 5228 (that has no problems, call it serv2 ).
I made a script that measures the number of connections on each type of
server respectively like this:

while [ 1 ]
do
 sleep 5
 netstat -ant | grep ESTABLISHED | awk '/:5228 /{a += 1}/:5222 /{b += 1} END
{print strftime(" %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S", systime(
))"   serv2: "a"   serv1: "b" total: "a+b }'
done

This is what happened around 7:46am (lines that have "+" in front indicate
anomaly):

Each server also reports the maximum numbers of authenticated connected
clients to the database.
Even though serv1 peaked at 07:44:46  at 4327 "ESTABLISHED" connections, the
number of normally authenticated clients in the database for this time
period is only 1100, which does not reflect this weird connections spike.
Since I was asleep at 7:46am, I did not have a chance to investigate what
those connections actually were.

> Anyone know what happens to new
> connection attempts to a server in this condition?
One thing that I noticed yesterday, that when server was in this condition,
telnet simply hang, as if no ACK packet was received back:

alecm at serv2 ~> telnet localhost 5222
Trying 127.0.0.1...
and nothing

This behavior or telnet seems to be unique to the case when ACK is not
received in the handshake, I verified that with tcpdump. To contrast that,
if nothing listens on the destination port for example, telnet gives:

alecm at serv2 ~> telnet localhost 50007
Trying 127.0.0.1...
telnet: connect to address 127.0.0.1: Connection refused
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused

which corresponds to RST packet that kernel returns in that case.
I tried to write a 5 line mucked up server with accept() not returning any
packets, and failed.

I ran the test code on Ubuntu Hardy but I don't see any memory problems.
I let the program run for about two minutes and memory remained constant
for the entire time.

LogFile doesn't do very much besides write to a Python file object.  Can
you reproduce the memory problem just using a file without using LogFile?

Thanks for the follow up and explaination.  It's good to know what was
going on here and what the fix was, even though it wasn't anything in
Twisted.

I will assume you did things like check your web server's log to see if a connection was made and if there was an error.....

Since you are using the POST method, I would expect you would have to set the headers argument (a dictionary). I notice the header argument is missing. I would expect entries such as Content-Type and Content-Length.

Cheers,
Andrew

Hi, Jean-Paul, thank you for reply and test;)

I open a single file, write the same data, memory is not automatically
released, after i delete the file, memory released..

Problem was I was missing the content type header. The content length
value is calculated somewhere in twisted.web.client
I just put in there the same content type firefox sends when posting a
form. Now it works.


getPage(url,method='POST',postdata=urllib.urlencode({'check_data':check_data}),headers={'Content-Type':'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'})

Thanks for the suggestions.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Using the Oscar protocol to send SMS text msgs
Message-ID: <BLU121-W10612CDD20ECDB5D0FF2C4D24D0@phx.gbl>

I'm wondering if anyone happens to have an example of how to send an SMS message through AIM using twisted.words.protocols.oscar.  Sending instant messages based on the code in oscardemo.py was simple enough, but when I tried to send a message to a phone number through an oscar.BOSConnection.sendMessage method such as:

self.sendMessage("+19995551212", [(msg,)], wantAck=0, autoResponse=False)

an SMS text message does not appear to be sent to the specified phone number, however, the number I tried to send the message to did end up appearing under "Recent Buddies" in AIM after trying this.  If I then attempt to send an SMS manually through version 6.9.1.2 of the AIM client it works as expected.  I'm guessing that perhaps a connection or ICBM parameter needs to be set to enable SMS messaging for the client connection made through oscar.  I looked at the code for the oscar protocol in Pidgin to see if that would shed any light on what I could be doing incorrectly and didn't see anything special being done for SMS text messages there aside from converting them to plain text before sending the message along in the same way as IM's are sent except that the user name is a phone number in the +<area code><number> format I've been trying with.  

thanks,

Dave

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Calling deferToThread from a thread
Message-ID: <95bb10690809180242r7688b554u3dd05c33f69a642d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have a data store api that mandates the return of deferreds for each
call. I have a number of implementations for the api - an in-memory
one for testing, and a number of other network + disk based apis.

My issue is this - I'm using py.test for unit testing (I'm aware of
trial, but for compatibility reasons with the rest of the project I
haven't looked into using it). To test deferred-based code I have set
up a separate thread which the reactor runs in (the setup and teardown
code is shown below for anyone who is interested).

def net():
    reactor.run(installSignalHandlers=0)

def setup_module(mod):
    global net_thread
    net_thread = threading.Thread(target=net)
    net_thread.start()
    time.sleep(1)

def teardown_module(module):
    reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop)

This seems to work generally fine. The problem (or at least I *think*
it's the problem) is that in one of my implementations uses
deferToThread internally to create a deferred which it then returns to
the caller. Is it thread safe to call a deferToThread in a separate
thread? Normally I'd do a reactor.callFromThread, but I'm not sure how
to get a deferred by this construct.

I see two options:
1. In my unit test I write a function f which makes the api call and
gets the deferred, and sets it to a local variable within the test
instance. Then I schedule f to run in the reactor thread via
reactor.callFromThread
2. I look into trial which has support for this kind of stuff??

Thanks for any help.

Cheers,
Reza

deferToThread isn't special.  Like pretty much any Twisted API, it is
only safe to call in the reactor thread.  It doesn't matter if the
reactor thread is the main thread or another one - whichever, that's
the only thread Twisted APIs are safe in.

Your best bet is to look at py.test's support for xunit style tests.
Whenever you need to deal with Deferreds, you should be using trial's
TestCase.  Anything else you do will be fragile and prone to break (as
trial is, but at least we will fix it when it breaks so that you don't
have to).

Hi
Can anyone tell me which is the best way to distribute a commercial
project based on Twisted for Linux.
It would be great if I can make .rpm and .deb packages which will
include twisted and some compiled modules of the project.
But I'm not sure how to do this. Should i turn to distutils or tap2rpm?

trial has very good support for deferreds.  If your test method returns
a deferred then trial magically does the right thing.  You don't need to
manage the reactor yourself.  See Twisted's docs and unit tests for
examples.

trial's API is based on unittest's, which is based on JUnit's.  Works
fine, but it has the Java nature.

I recommend trying nose.  It has support for deferreds, using a
decorator.  And its API is based on the py.test API.  Unfortunately they
chose to spell setup and teardown differently, so you can't use your
py.test test modules unchanged, but the changes are usually trivial.

Hi All,
I'm trying to pick up Twisted and I'm having trouble with looping.

I expected that a Deferred returned from a looping call would be available
after each call.  But it's only available after the loop is stopped.  Am I
looking for a different class?

Thanks,
Dave

p.s.  Ultimately I'd like to watch a file and post any new lines up to an
HTTP server.  If there is a direct way to get there, please let me know.
Thanks!

Hi,

We've successfully used bbfreeze
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bbfreeze/0.95.4) to build binaries with
twisted on linux. To make a deb from that binary is pretty easy, read
up on the 'dpkg-deb' command. You can also convert that .deb to an
.rpm using a tool called 'alien'.

It's not, and if you think about it, it can't - a loopingcall is setup 
once and run indefinitely, who would you be "returning" the deferreds 
to, and how?

Just call your handler from within your loopingcall i.e.

def check_file(fp, cb):
   # blah blah
   for line in lines:
     cb(line)

The code you show isn't a very robust way of following a file. My advice 
would be to run "tail -F -q name" in a sub-process and accumulate the 
output.

You need to be aware when watching an external file that when you read, 
the whole line might not have been written, so you need to do something 
like this:

buffer = ''
def check(file, handler):
   buffer += file.read()
   if not '\n' in buffer:
     return

   lines = buffer.split('\n')
   # the final "line" in the buffer doesn't have a terminating
   # \n, make it be the buffer and drop it from out list
   buffer = lines.pop()
   for line in lines:
     handler(line)

Message-ID: <d6bdc39c0809211735h7b4d22d8h3710a87f312e0db0@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list, I'd like to revive a topic touched on in the past. I'm playing with
python socket programming and decided I want to make a simplistic bittorrent
clone that uses UDP instead of TCP. My main reasons for the protocol choice
are (1) I don't need guaranteed in-order delivery, and (2) I need to get
around NAT restrictions without making the user manually forward ports.
Couple questions...

1. Are those good reasons to ditch TCP, or am I being an idiot? (Always a
possibility.)

2. Even though I don't need TCP's in-order guarantee, I still need an
ACKing mechanism to make sure all the packets eventually arrive. Is there
any (simple) code written that accomplishes this with UDP?

It's not easier to get UDP through NATs.  It's just as hard or harder.

It must be a widely held error, then, because it's what I hear every time
the subject arises. My understanding was that since UDP doesn't have the
concept of "streams," most NATs will allow all UDP packets through to a
given port one it is first hole-punched.

Nat traversal aside, I'm also concerned about performance, and since TCP
doesn't make in-order delivery optional, I'm still tempted to stick with
UDP...

For a bittorrent-like application, you're also not particularly concerned
with *latency*, just throughput.  Allowing out-of-order delivery primarily
reduces latency, it doesn't do a whole lot for throughput.

That's a good point, I didn't consider that. Latency is only really
important for streaming media and gaming, so this probably is a bad idea
after all. Well anyway thanks for the input, I appreciate it.

Hi all,

I'd like to be able to use the twisted plugin mechanism to extract
classes that implement given interfaces. I've successfully followed
the examples to get an iterator over _objects_ that provide my
interfaces, but can't find a way to get just the classes.

Does such a facility exist or am I going to need a rethink? Thanks in advance...

Hi Paul,

Try using classProvides() instead of implements() in your class  
definition. That should result in the plugin system returning the  
class itself, instead of the instance.

Message-ID: <145518663ff04ce4300f2ccdf3b2ee4a@chopper.luffy.cx>


Hi!

I would like to do something like this with Twisted:

x.open()
try:
 x.someoperations()
 x.otheroperations()
finally:
 x.close()

I could do something like this :

d = open_and_get_x()
d.addCallback(someoperations)
d.addCallback(otheroperations)
d.addBoth(closeAndReRaiseIfError)
return d

Each callback would return x to let the next callback proceed it. However,
if there is an error, I have no "x" to close in "closeAndReRaiseIfError".
How can I do that?

Thanks.

There are a lot of ways.  You could make x an attribute of a shared object,
or you could close over it in the first callback to create the "finally"
handler, or you could pass it along as an argument to the `addBoth´ call
(again, in the first callback).

Notice that there's a slight difference between the two code examples you
gave.  The first won't close x in response to errors from `x.open()´, but
`closeAndReRaiseIfError´ will be called even for errors from `open_and_get_x´.
If you only add the finally handler in the first callback attached to `d´,
then this difference goes away.

Yes, that's usually true, especially for home NATs. Some NATs do  
actually track UDP conversations between endpoints just like TCP  
streams, though. Traversing a NAT with UDP is /usually/ easier, when  
you have multiple endpoints you wish to hear from. But don't forget  
about the other kinds of NATs too, which you'll also have to implement  
support for. That's what makes it hard: implementing things multiple  
times for all the different network topologies.

Not entirely true. In order delivery is preserved to your application,  
but out-of-order delivery between the host endpoints is supported.  
Read up on the TCP "selective ACK" feature [1], which basically all  
OSes made since 1998 or so support. So a missed packet or two doesn't  
actually require all later data to always be retransmitted.

How can I program a service in Twisted that listens for both UDP and
TCP traffic at the same port? I naively created two services for it,
but then got into an error message because I was listening the same

Disregard my message; it seems the problem was that the port I tried
to use was really in use, because using the same setup on another port
DID work.

If you are a piece of software behind a NAT, and you want to accept a 
connection from a peer, there are three things you can do:

  1. Require some explicit configuration from the user; ask them to punch 
a hole through their NAT and tell you what port to use.  This is by far 
the easiest for you, but considered unacceptable since its default 
configuration will usually be broken.
  2. Use a protocol like UPnP or Nat-PMP to get around the user's router. 
This will work on a minority of deployed endpoints, but when it does 
work it will work great, and your application can just make regular TCP 
connections.
  3. Punch a hole, abusing the router's NAT routing rules in order to get 
it to think it's making a connection when it is actually accepting one. 
There are about six different ways to do this, but you can do it with 
UDP *or* TCP.  Different routers support different schemes, and I don't 
just mean "some support TCP, some support UDP": UDP port mapping 
_usually_ works a certain way, but there are exceptions.  You should at 
least read the papers referenced here:  http://midcom- 
p2p.sourceforge.net/

In order to build a truly robust application you will need to do all of 
the above.  Even if you do #2 and #3 perfectly, there are a surprising 
percentage of home routers (say, 5-10%) which are just buggy and won't 
route your traffic properly to another NAT no matter what you do, so you 
always need to provide a "just tell the NAT what to do manually" option. 
(Or, forward your traffic through some known-to-work intermediary.)

TCP will, in general, "perform" better than UDP, because TCP can cheat 
whereas UDP can't.  Your ISP can (and probably does, according to rumors 
I've heard from people who have worked on such things) deploy "smart" 
routers which can prioritize traffic using the additional information 
present in TCP headers which UDP doesn't provide.  Plus, there are 
things that your operating system is doing (as James already mentioned) 
that are extensions to the core TCP spec.

If you don't understand _at least_ enough about TCP to have implemented 
it yourself once, then you probably don't understand enough to make the 
decision to use UDP for performance reasons.  I am saying this because 
it was at the point where I actually implemented TCP myself that I 
gained this insight :).

I started a project a while ago to try to abstract away all this NAT- 
traversal nonsense and present an API for making a connection to a peer- 
to-peer user over whatever methods are available.  It's definitely in 
need of some maintenance, but if you're already using Twisted I think 
you'll find it easier to get started with this than to build your own 
P2P framework from the ground up: 
http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodVertex

Good luck!

Hello everyone,

I have written an application that has one server and multiple clients

(for now) as an executable or a service. I can't have to have to install 
python and all the deps, this needs to be a drag-n-drop-n-execute-it-n-

one tac file seems slower. One of the services has a wx GUI too. Does 
anyone have any pointers/ideas/links concerning this? I saw that py2exe

it really works.

Thank you,

That should at least get you started.

I have tried starting the client both as 'ssh localhost -p 5022' as  
well as running the sshsimpleclient.py script with the same results.

I have also tried connecting from a different host into the server,  
with the same results.

Any help in resolving this issue and realizing a working example of an  
ssh server would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

This looks a lot like a bug in PyCrypto:

This is a file in PyCrypto itself, calling a method in PyCrypto itself,
and passing the wrong arguments.

You might want to try using the last release of PyCrypto instead of the
latest development snapshot.  You might also want to file a bug with the
PyCrypto maintainer (it seems there's a new one now) to get this fixed.

I did revert to 2.0.1 and the problem did go away.

I will file a bug report to the PyCrypto guy.

You can find the API documentation for failures here:

  http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.failure.Failure.html

You might be interested in the printTraceback method.  You can also
pass a failure to twisted.python.log.err and a traceback will be written.

Keep in mind, however, that not all failures have tracebacks.  If you try
printing a failure's traceback and don't see anything interesting, this
may be because the failure wasn't created with a traceback.  In this case,
running with failure debugging enabled (eg, with twistd --debug) may provide
more useful information, since it will set a breakpoint on failure creation,
letting you inspect the creation context.

Hi!

I am writing some code which requires synchronization between several

You might want twisted.internet.defer.gatherResults().  It accepts a
list of Deferreds and returns a Deferred that fires when they all fire.

Jean-Paul,

Thanks! Seems like what I need. The only thing missing is ability to  
specify
timeout parameters, how long to wait for deferred to fire.

Sincerely,
Vadim

since gatherResults won't block you can implement your own timeout
with callLater.

Pardon my naive questions, but how I can easily call gatherResults() to
wait for all deferred to fire and to return list of results in form of  
list
of (success,result) tuples?

Never mind. I have managed to do it in asynchronous manner, via  
callbacks.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] LoopingCall question : ping w/ timeout using
	shared variable -> problem
Message-ID: <48DB5AF3.1030300@arimaz.com>

Hello everyone!

I have written some code uses a LoopingCall to send a "ping" at regular 
intervals. If it hasn't received an answer before the next call, it 
notifies me that the destination isn't available, if it does then it 
does nothing. I am getting lots of "unavailables" on hosts that are, I 
tried augmenting the timeout (the ping interval) and it doesn't change 
anything. I think what is happening is I'm using a simple variable to 
keep the availability state and that since protocol and the 
LoopingCall's callback both access the variable, this causes problems. 
Is there a better way of doing things or am I bound to use some sort of 
locking mechanism? If I have to use locking, which one do you recommend?

Thank you,
Gabriel

I tried using a reactor.callLater call and if it fires then it notifies 
me (unavailable) and if I get the response I cancel it and start over, 
this seams like a better approach.

Hello everybody,

I am trying to use py2exe with twisted, but I'm running into a problem : 
one of my classes uses twisted's plugin mechanism and they aren't 
loaded. I tried the python version and it works correctly. I saw that to 
use sqlite with storm I have to explicitly import it somewhere like so :

 import storm.databases.sqlite

because py2exe wasn't finding it since it's imported using __import__(), 
do I have to do something like that with twisted?

Thank you,

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Ampoule - 0.0.2
Message-ID: <8B49DB20-0642-4A7F-B7E6-B30A6EEF47A4@gmail.com>

I just released Ampoule 0.0.2 on pypi and launchpad

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ampoule/0.0.2
https://launchpad.net/ampoule/ampoule/0.0.2

Ampoule is a process pool implementation written
on top of Twisted Matrix. Its name comes from the
use of AMP as the default communication protocol
between the pool and all its children.

It's different from other alternative solutions because it
provides an API very close to that of the Twisted ThreadPool.
As an helper function it also provides a deferToAMPProcess
function that creates the ProcessPool and submits jobs to it.

The code is pretty well tested, in fact it contains more test lines
than actual code lines, and it's pretty well documented.

Speedwise on my macbook pro I was able to run about 1700 Ping
calls per second without recycling processes and about 1500 with
a recycling value of about 10000 calls per process.
If anyone wants to contribute a C implementation of amp
serializer/deserializer I'm pretty sure that Ampoule would benefit a
lot from it but for my current tasks 1500 calls per second is more
than fast enough, it's actually pretty fast.

A usage example is the following:

from ampoule import child, util
from twisted.protocols import amp

class Pid(amp.Command):
     response = [("pid", amp.Integer())]

class MyChild(child.AMPChild):
     @Pid.responder
     def pid(self):
         import os
         return {"pid": os.getpid()}

@util.mainpoint
def main(args):
     import sys
     from twisted.internet import reactor, defer
     from twisted.python import log
     log.startLogging(sys.stdout)

     from ampoule import pool

     @defer.inlineCallbacks
     def _run():
         pp = pool.ProcessPool(MyChild)
         yield pp.start()
         result = yield pp.doWork(Pid)
         print "The Child process PID is:", result['pid']
         yield pp.stop()
         reactor.stop()

     reactor.callLater(1, _run)
     reactor.run()

What's new in this version:

Ampoule 0.0.2 (2008-09-26)
==========================

Features
--------
  - Support process recycling after predefined number of calls.

Changes
-------
  - ProcessPool argument max_idle is now maxIdle to comply with Twisted
    style guidelines.

  - removed ampoule.runner module because it was essentially useless,
    if you want to change subprocess startup behavior pass a string that
    contains the new code as an argument by overriding the default
    processFactory for example with a closure like this:

        from ampoule.main import startAMPProcess
        from ampoule.pool import ProcessPool
        pp = ProcessPool()
        def myProcessFactory(*args, **kwargs):
            kwargs['bootstrap'] = myBootstrapCode
            return startAMPProcess(*args, **kwargs)
        pp.processFactory = staticmethod(myProcessFactory)

Have fun with ampoule! :)

Take a look at the API docs and the examples.  Perhaps get a copy of
_Twisted Network Programming Essentials_ or find the Conch chapter
online.  If you get stuck, come back with specific questions.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Syslog Listener UDP
Message-ID: <a33934630809281118y34e23dfdq769c5ea2ab8e9acd@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to build a syslog(udp port 514) listener in twisted.  The goal
is to make it compatible with syslog and syslog-ng, which may be configured
on a "client" to send log entries (as they occur) via udp (fire and forget)
to a remote server (my twisted server).

Is there already something out there that would do this or that would be a
good start?

Thanks,


Marc

Because  of the  simplicity of  the syslog  protocol, you  can  just use
UDPServer with  a protocol derived from DatagramProtocol.  You just need
to overload datagramReceived to do  something sensible with the log line
received.

In short:

class SyslogInput(protocol.DatagramProtocol):

      def datagramReceived(self, data):
          print "I have received %r" % data

service = internet.UDPServer(514, SyslogInput())

Hope this isn't too offensive but last time I checked conch didn't work 
on win32 (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/50). I guess most users 
would be happy with a basic "secure RPC" implementation, no console 
stuff. No idea how much work that is though ...

Ticket 50 is about the conch command line client.  I'm not sure if the
rest of conch, the part you would use to automate an SSH login, works on
Windows or not.  It shouldn't be affected by the lack of an fcntl module
(or any of the other modules missing on Windows), but it may accidentally
import them, preventing the code from working out of the box, even though
it doesn't use them.  This is probably simpler to fix than actually writing
a command line client.  However, it may already work; I don't have a Windows
machine handy to try, but by looking at buildbot I can see that a significant
portion of the Conch test suite runs and passes on there.

There could be a few things that could not be happening. Do you have the
correct username and password?
Do you have the correct server? Does the server use srv records?

If you have the ability you can check your xmpp server logs to see if it
connected.

For a non-twisted solution, you can also try paramiko:
http://www.lag.net/paramiko/

It might be a bit easier to wrap your brain around if you are very new to
the twisted way of doing things.

It should also work nicely on Win32 (I haven't checked in a while but the
last time I used it it worked fine).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] txThrift released
Message-ID: <200809292237.28827.esteve@fluidinfo.com>

Hi all,

I'm pleased to announce that Fluidinfo [1] is releasing support for Twisted in 
Apache/Facebook Thrift [2]

Download from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-148

We hope to get it accepted into the Thrift core, but in the meantime you can 
apply the patch. There's also a simple example based on the Thrift calculator 
demo.

To add support for Twisted in a Thrift service, simply run "thrift --gen 
py:twisted specfile.thrift" from the command line. For more details, you can 
follow the calculator example, as it covers Thrift extensively.

Feedback and contributions will be greatly appreciated! :-)

Cheers.

PS: the JIRA web page lets you vote issues, so just show your support if you 
think this patch is useful :-)

Conch does work on Win32, I have written an application that uses
it (not the command line client). You have to install pycrypto 
in addition to Twisted.

Message-ID: <6bea62950809291511r76a43d4fi117231d9c6455f61@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,I try to use twisted for asynchronous serial port read().

Here is my simple twisted code:
==========================
from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.internet.serialport import SerialPort
from twisted.internet.protocol import Protocol

class Client(Protocol):
    def connectionMade(self):
        print 'connected'

    def dataReceived(self, data):
        print data

SerialPort(Client(), 'COM4', reactor)
reactor.callLater(20, reactor.stop())
reactor.run()

==========================

It runs on my Mac with this line changed to SerialPort(Client,
'dev/tty.usbserial-A4001mLL', reactor) which is my Arduino board device.

But on Windows XP, it gave the error message:
"AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'addEvent' "

I tried to used different reactor, such as selectreactor, win32eventreactor,
but the error message became "AssertionError: reactor already installed"

Please help. Thanks

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Question on default t.p.log output
Message-ID: <18658.8510.659765.567315@jon.es>

Greetings Twisted superheroes!

I have a simple question about logging. Here's a snippet of code:

    from twisted.python import log
    from twisted.web import client
    from twisted.internet import reactor
    import sys

    log.startLogging(sys.stdout)
    def stop(x): reactor.callLater(0, reactor.stop)
    client.getPage('http://www.divmod.com').addBoth(stop)
    reactor.run()

This produces the output

    2008/09/30 14:16 +0200 [-] Log opened.
    2008/09/30 14:16 +0200 [-] Starting factory <HTTPClientFactory: http://www.divmod.com>
    2008/09/30 14:16 +0200 [HTTPPageGetter,client] Stopping factory <HTTPClientFactory: http://divmod.com/?__session_just_started__=1>
    2008/09/30 14:16 +0200 [-] Main loop terminated.

I had a look around and can see where (most) of this is coming from.

First off, the start/stop factory messages are surprising and feel ugly to
me. I mean that's my stdout you're scribbling that stuff all over. The
starting and stopping factory methods, despite appearing next to each other
in the same base Factory class, don't give the same [...] component in
their output. Sometimes I get [Uninitialized], sometimes [-], and sometimes
[HTTPPageGetter,client] as above - with both starting and stopping
messages.

And then, and misleading IMO, is that in a callback attached to the
deferred from getPage, the log output (to the uninitiated, a class I am
arguably a prime member of) still appears to have something to do with
HTTPPageGetter,client when in fact the page has been retrieved, and the
callback fired. It's like HTTPPageGetter,client refuses to lie down and die
quietly, and insists on sitting up in the casket to holler at its
ungrateful descendant callbacks: Hey, I'm the one that kicked this off and
don't you forget it!

Ahem. I see that output is controlled by a var called noisy in the base
Factory class. By why is it True by default if it really is just noise?
Judging from the code (and the use of log.msg not log.err) it's not an

In my actual use case, I see my log filling up with output like this:

I guess the answer might be that I should make my own version of getPage
that sets noisy to False after making its HTTPClientFactory, or maybe
subclass FileLogObserver and override emit. Or I guess I could be calling
functions with log.callWithContext.

But those approached seem to be wheeling in a lot of machinery just to set
to False a variable that (arguably?) should be False to begin with.

See - told you it was simple. I'm at my very best nibbling away on the very
edges of the Twist-o-verse.

Thank you for at least noticing this ;-).

The logging code is quite ugly, but unfortunately, almost nobody cares. 
If you could dedicate any time at all to improving it, even a little, 
we'd all really appreciate it.

The way the log prefix is calculated is based on what actual event is 
firing from the reactor.  So, whatever object *generates* the callback 
is the one whose log prefix will be used.

It would definitely be nice if the log could follow the asynchronous 
thread of execution.  Patches accepted :).

It sounds like you have several complaints here.

1.) You don't want logs to go to stdout.

This is easy.  You can direct the log wherever you want, and overriding 
stdout is optional; take a look at the arguments to startLogging. 
(Unless you're talking about customizing logging in twistd, which is a 
whole other mess that there is a universe of tickets for.)

2.) Factories are too noisy by default.

Knowing when factories start up and shut down can actually be incredibly 
useful.  It's a pain when they're filling up your logs with spam, but a 
better solution would be some kind of structured log format with a log 
viewer application, not destroying the information so that viewing logs 
with 'less' is easier.

3.) Factories' start and stop messages do not include useful 
information.

Quite so.  It would be nicer if they did.

4.) The log prefix isn't always useful or correct.

This may be true, but we'd need a ticket filed that includes a complete 
enumeration of exactly _how_ they aren't useful or correct, and each 
case would need to be fixed.

5.) The log prefix for Deferred callbacks doesn't follow the 
asynchronous origin of the callback.

Figuring out how to do this is really tricky, because in different cases 
you want different things.  However, twisted.python.context provides a 
hook for you to potentially capture some state when Deferreds, at least 
certain Deferreds, are spun up.  If you can come up with a really clear 
statement of requirements for a particular log prefix, you can probably 
get it.

6.) The HTTP client is too noisy and should emit fewer log messages.

Possibly - but then I recently discovered some very interesting 
information by watching a server which had a bunch of outstanding 
getPage connections spew out thousands of 'stopping factory' messages in 
their output - and seeing those URLs was an invaluable debugging aid.

7.) Twisted's log messages are generally ugly and difficult to 
understand.

Touche - but again, this needs to be fixed on a case-by-case basis; 
nothing to be done in general.  Except, of course, to come up with some 
kind of standard for what makes up a useful / helpful log message; and 
that's probably not going to be the unstructured mess of strings that 
currently goes into the log.  (Can you tell I'm pushing a structured log 
format that can be parsed?)

Please feel free to file some tickets for areas of this behavior that 
you have noticed.  I wish I had time to pour into the logging system, 
but neither I (nor any of our sponsors) _really_ needs it to be any 
better; it's just a constant annoyance.

You'd all appreciate it but OTOH almost nobody cares??? Hmmm. Hard to

But I also see lines like this:

And - and Uninitialized do not have any clear correspondence with reactor
events. (BTW, I do see where these are coming from.)

glyph> It would definitely be nice if the log could follow the asynchronous

Yes, agreed that would be nice. From my memory of defer.py... (insert vague
comment about how this might not be so hard - for you :-)).

glyph> It sounds like you have several complaints here.

glyph> 1.) You don't want logs to go to stdout.

I do want that, that's why I used sys.stdout.

glyph> 2.) Factories are too noisy by default.

Right, and so viewing them when running a script from the command line that
wants to do some logging to stdout is also fine.

OK, thinking about that.

OK, but by your own description that's output that's useful for debugging
(and above you call it spam). My only real question was why that output is
on by default instead of off (especially seeing as it's often adding 1K of
output to my log file for a single logged message).

glyph> 7.) Twisted's log messages are generally ugly and difficult to 
glyph> understand.

glyph> Touche

But I didn't say that... I'm very happy to not have to write logging
code. Sure, the [HTTPPageGetter,client] speaking from beyond the grave is a
bit unsettling, but that's minor.

Understood, thanks. I'm mainly just trying to understand what's going on
and why.

I will have a bit more of a poke around. As I was going to say, from what I
remember about the callback mechanism in defer.py it seems like one should
be able to have some kind of data structure that's being maintained
(pushed, popped) there that could be updating a log prefix in some way.

Thanks!

Terry

Hello all,

Here's a summary of what Chris Armstrong, Itamar Shtull-Trauring,
and myself accomplished this past Sunday at the Twisted sprint.

Itamar took turns pairing with Chris and I.  He and Chris worked on
creating command line tools to invoke the release automation libraries
which we've already written.  You can find the results in a branch linked
from ticket #3439.

Itamar and I (and later Chris and I) worked on providing improved support
in Trial for inspecting warnings which have been emitted over the course
of a test.  This is in support of the high-level deprecation API described
in ticket #3266.

hi friends thanks for immediate reply.
i have referred the book twisted..........
currently i am facing the problem.
i have to show ls -l output in a listbox using Tkinter
but because of TCP it first stores information in a window or some packet
format.
so it doesnot show the output in a continuous manner.

This isn't the right way to use Tk with Twisted.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] sending signal through SSHChannel
Message-ID: <8cc9d3030809300906u1db77d9ag2abb2e5257ab6a57@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I have written a python program that executes shell scripts on remote
computers using the twisted conch SSHChannel. Several shell scripts
are executed at once on several machines and the scripts range in
execution time from minutes to hours.

My question is regarding the behavior of Conch when it is shut down.
What i would like to do is to send a SIGINT or SIGKILL to the remote
script so that it can terminate in an orderly fashion. I am using the
channel.SSHChannel as a base class for my task. Is there a mechanism
in Conch for sending this signal?

best regards

frans

Yes, let's.  Who would be interested in attending a sprint on the 25th or
the 26th of October?

That's particularly good timing for me, because I'm going to be taking
the following week as holiday from work. I'll be there.
