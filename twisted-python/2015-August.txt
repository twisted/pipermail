Hi everyone,

I've just uploaded 15.3.0pre2 to http://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/15.3.0pre2/ , which provides a small fix for Twisted-using libraries that subclass Protocol overwriting the `_log` attribute.

Please test your software with it, but as this is a very minor change, I will release it very soon.

Twisted Regards,

Amber "Hawkie" Brown

Message-ID: <2B4C122E-4DA0-4743-8D30-B0F419084098@atleastfornow.net>

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Labs, I am honoured to announce the release of Twisted 15.3.

We're marching confidently into the future, and this release demonstrates this:

	* 10+ modules ported to Python 3 (see NEWS for specifics)
 	* Twisted Lore has been removed.
	* Twisted no longer releases as 'subprojects' -- there is only one Twisted, long may it reign.
	* twistd now uses cProfile (instead of Hotshot) as the default profiler.
	* 40+ more tickets closed overall.

You can find the downloads at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted (or alternatively http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads). The NEWS file can be found at https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/trunk/NEWS .

Many thanks to everyone who had a part in this release - the supporters of the Twisted Software Foundation, the developers who contributed code as well as documentation, and all the people building great things with Twisted!

Twisted Regards,

Subject: [Twisted-Python] failing coverage builders
Message-ID: <0F605D53-2798-4447-8CD2-19857D1A4ED1@twistedmatrix.com>

The python 3.4 coverage builders are failing, apparently because one of the builders is down:

<https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/debian7-py3.4-coverage/builds/399/steps/shell_5/logs/stdio <https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/debian7-py3.4-coverage/builds/399/steps/shell_5/logs/stdio>>

I'll probably make those builders unsupported later today if there is no obvious fix; at this point, depending on codecov is mostly just a net negative.  We can't have it reasonably fail our builds or report status for us, and "coverage html" produces perfectly usable coverage reports, and so the main consequence is that our builds will fail if they're down (or if they introduce a version of coverage on PyPI that doesn't support python 3, apparently?)

Hi Glyph,

I'll take a look.

I find the combined codecov rather valuable for figuring out what isn't covered on either, but I'll remove it for now.

I already removed it earlier, so that should be easy :-).

Raw coverage can do combining, if we can just ship the files somewhere:

http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/cmd.html#cmd-combining <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/cmd.html#cmd-combining>

But, perhaps we should just not fail the build if codecov submission fails.

Hi all,
I am using Twisted to make a game server. I want to be able to ban IP 
addresses. Currently I check if the host is in a blacklist, and if it 
is, call abortConnection on the transport. It works fine, but I'm 
thinking there should be a better way, to actively refuse the connection 
in the first place?

Cheers,

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Updates on the Twisted Buildbots
Message-ID: <EF5EDAF8-1785-42B0-AA03-AA61520DD402@atleastfornow.net>

Hi everyone,

If you haven't looked at the buildbots for a while, there's been some changes! (for brevity's sake, unsupported builders will be prefixed with a U, eg "U2.7")

- Fedora 17 (2.7), 18 (2.7), 19 (2.7, 3.3), and RHEL6 (2.6) are removed, and replaced by RHEL7 (2.7), Fedora 21 (2.7, 3.4), Fedora 22 (U2.7, U3.4, to be fixed very soon, UPyPy2.4). RHEL6 will return with the 2.7 EPEL soon.
- FreeBSD 10.1 is supported on both Py2.7 and Py3.4.
- OS X 10.6 has been removed and OSX 10.10 has been added (2.7-select supported, kqueue and cfreactor both unsupported)
- Ubuntu 15.04 is now a supported platform (2.7, 3.4) and has unsupported PyPy (2.5) and Jython (2.7) builders.
- All of the builders (excepting Windows) are built and ran in a virtualenv. This means that they have up-to-date dependencies, and if Twisted gains dependencies, the infra team can add them to the build process easily.

Twisted Regards,

Amber "Hawkie" Brown

I am not aware of any hook in the BSD socket API that lets you refuse a connection entirely. Generally, you put a socket into ?listen? mode (indicating to the OS that you?ll accept new connections), and then you call accept() to get the new connection. In fact, the OS will accept the connection even before you call accept(): it?ll do it asynchronously, and you will just get the FD for the connection. IIRC Windows has a winsock specific thing that might do what you want, but that?s pretty platform specific and probably doesn?t actually prevent the connection getting established anyway.

If you really want to never allow the connection at all, you?ll probably want to program iptables (or some other firewall if you aren?t on Linux) to do the packet filtering for you. A combination of iptables and ipsets will get you a high-performance IP address blacklist that will drop all packets before they ever reach your application.

There is a shortcut in Twisted, at least, although it does not actually refuse the initial connection for the reasons listed above; you can examine the "addr" passed to IProtocolFactory.buildProtocol and return None.

Thanks for that. I was sort of hoping for a Pythonic solution that doesn't rely on SubProcess ETC, particularly as I want this server to run on any OS you throw at it. Thanks for the idea though, I'll certainly use that if I get something that little Python can't handle.

This is perfect, thanks. It would have been better to refuse the connection entirely, but as Corey said, I can use iptables if I get desperate.

 Python HTTP proxy server - txtorhttpproxy
Message-ID: <CAFN1edrfiV-BFBt6YNV1QvmfFca19LsnmdrUpGGppX4A_5e+fQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Twisted/Tor developers,

I am motivated by language security concerns. I think Twisted Python
can often implement excellent replacements for our old crufty C
implementations. In this case I'd like to stop using C programs
running as root (or not root) to torify http connections... like
privoxy, polipo, apt tor transport etc.

Last year I wrote this little tor http proxy; yes it also handles RFC
2817 proxy CONNECT method as well:
https://github.com/david415/txtorhttpproxy

I wrote an AgentProxy that can proxy any sort of twisted http agent:
https://github.com/david415/txtorhttpproxy/blob/master/txtorhttpproxy/proxy.py

It used to use more terrible underscore imports but Leif fixed the
bit-rot and made it work with Twisted 15:
https://github.com/david415/txtorhttpproxy/commit/38f1a0cfab586f7a8965a47e9c8f951b351426a2

Is this project worthy of your precious 10 minutes to review it... so
I can improve the code quality?

If I get rid of this last terrible import:
from twisted.web._newclient import ResponseDone

then I'm not sure how to detect when to call the finish() method here:
https://github.com/david415/txtorhttpproxy/blob/master/txtorhttpproxy/proxy.py#L38-L52


Sincerely,
David Stainton

Message-ID: <3C57766C-D165-4201-AFF7-3530CFE5CE18@twistedmatrix.com>

In https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/changeset/45163 twisted.internet.application.service.Service to be a new-style class.  Just to remind everyone, converting an old-style class to a new-style class is an incompatible change, and reviewers should look for this.

We discovered this because this change breaks https://github.com/twisted/axiom, and probably it breaks other packages as well, since lots of things inherit from Service.  So please remain diligent about looking for this in future changes.  Now that it's been changed, reverting it in 15.4 would be another incompatible change, so we probably won't do that, but please keep an eye out in the future.

Fortunately, ResponseDone is re-exported by twisted.web.client:
             
    >>> import twisted.web.client
    >>> twisted.web.client.ResponseDone is twisted.web._newclient.ResponseDone
    True
    >>> twisted.__version__
    '11.0.0'

I couldn't get 9.0 to compile in the five seconds I tried, but 11.0 is
still pretty old. I think it always was re-exported like this.

I have updated the wiki page to include this note and the reason why
we need this.

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Plan/Python3#Reviewerchecklist

Please check that wiki page is ok.

In my defense :)
Amber warned me about such changes, but when I asked (over IRC) why
they are bad I did received any convincing reason :)

I assume that this is the error in axiom:
https://github.com/twisted/axiom/issues/44

In axiom a class was defined as

class _SiteScheduler(object, Service, SchedulerMixin)

Is this a common practice?
Why do you want to have multiple inheritance and put object as the
first inherited class and not the last one?

Changing a class from old style to new style changes the method resolution
order, which is going to break lots of code in ways that we can't
anticipate. We can't find every subclass and judge whether their usage
makes sense. We can only stick to our compatibility policy
<https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CompatibilityPolicy>, which empowers
users to decide when & how they change their weird code.

The one reason that it matters is that we need to consistently tell users how to prepare for the fact that eventually, everything will be new-style.  Perhaps it will only be new-style because we eventually drop python 2, perhaps it will only be new-style because python 2.8 will deprecate classic classes, perhaps we will eventually have a flag day just to reduce the maintenance burden, perhaps each old-style class will be individually deprecated and replaced with a new-style one.  In any case, the migration will be much easier for users if they learn now that putting 'object' at the end of their bases list is a way to avoid caring about this issue entirely :).

Otherwise I agree completely with your sentiment.

Dear Aaon Gallagher,

Thanks for the helpful observation. i'm going to make the correction
soon and then we'll be underscore free.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] twisted on jython
Message-ID: <B58DAA66-2ED9-421D-AE7A-D38EB9CCB375@twistedmatrix.com>

We currently have an unsupported builder for Jython 2.7: <https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/ubuntu15.04-jython2.7 <https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/ubuntu15.04-jython2.7>>

This is great, so that we can fix issues that make Twisted not support Jython, but some of the bugs that are causing it not to work may be on the Jython side as well.

Hawkowl, would it be possible to set up a Jython trunk builder?  This will remain unsupported, of course, but it would give the Jython developers the ability to see how changes they make are affecting Twisted's progress to a supported version - and possibly cut a release on their end if it turns green ;).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Screen clearing in the Manhole
Message-ID: <1440520054.2262163.365674993.6595850F@webmail.messagingengine.com>

I'm making a manhole service in the usual way:

class PF(ServerProtocol):??????? def protocolFactory(*a, **kw):
return manhole.Manhole(namespace)

realm = manhole_ssh.TerminalRealm()??? realm.chainedProtocolFactory = PF
mh_portal = portal.Portal(realm)??? mh_portal.registerChecker(checker)

manhole_service = TCPServer(0, manhole_ssh.ConchFactory(mh_portal))
manhole_service.startService()

and I'd like to print a message when the terminal is opened. This
change does it:

class PF(ServerProtocol):??????? def protocolFactory(*a, **kw):
class Manhole(manhole.Manhole):??????????????? def connectionMade(self):
super(Manhole, self).connectionMade()
self.terminal.write('Hello')??????????? return
manhole.Manhole(namespace)

and so does this version, which is better because
t.c.i.i.ServerProtocol.connectionMade says it is the place to
write messages:

class PF(ServerProtocol):??????? def protocolFactory(*a, **kw):
return manhole.Manhole(namespace)

def connectionMade(self):??????????? ServerProtocol.connectionMade(self)
self.write('Hello')

But in both cases, after the message the screen is cleared by what looks
like a form feed, and another prompt is printed. So far I can't find
where in the code this happens. Is there a way to print a message and
not have it scrolled off the screen?

Thanks,

Peter.

As to where it happens, look at
twisted.conch.recvline.RecvLine.connectionMade() and
twisted.conch.insults.insults.TerminalProtocol.makeConnection()

You could step on the RecvLine. initializeScreen(), but I have no idea what
the side effects are. (And of course if you bypass all or part of it, even
if it works now, it's alway subject to future breakage.

t.c.r.R.connectionMade() calls self.initializeScreen(), which in turn 
calls self.terminal.reset()

I'm pretty sure s.t.reset() is actually twisted.conch.insults.reset(),
which has a bug (or an undesirable feature), it sends a "hard reset"
escape sequence to the terminal (<ESC>c).  This freaks out many terminal
emulators, and real, VT100-compatible terminals, in many different ways.

I've tested in Kermit-95, PuTTy, xterm, DECterm (a VT emulator written for
DECwindows, DEC's X implementation) and on real DEC VT420 and VT520
terminals.  They act differently, but none are pleasant.  For example, a
VT520 does a power-cycle on the CRT (which takes about 10 seconds),
reloads the saved configuration, and (if you have multiple sessions
enabled) switches to Session 1. 

The VT420 and VT520 manuals say about "hard reset", basically, "Don't
do that!!"

I have a patch to change it to send a soft reset (<ESC>[!p) and to set the
terminal into "replace mode" (<ESC>[4l) (sometimes the software thought it
was in overstrike mode, but the terminal thought it was in insert mode,
with bad results. Ideally, it would set both the software and hardware to
what ever mode the user desired.  The hard reset would set the terminal to
whichever mode was stored in its permanent settings.  For a software
terminal emulator, it was a dice roll.)

Depending on the terminal emulator or physical terminal you are using,
this probably explains your symptoms.

My subclass of Manhole first calls Manhole.connectionMade, which calls
HistoricRecvLine.connectionMade, which calls RecvLine.connectionMade,
which resets the screen exactly as you say. Then, after the screen has
been reset, I print the message. But then the screen is cleared a
second time!

This does sound like a scary bug, especially on a real terminal, but I
tried your patch and it didn't affect my symptom of the screen being
cleared again. That's more about "when" rather than "how".

I found it!

Manhole.terminalSize, inherited from RecvLine, does
self.terminal.eraseDisplay(). 
t.c.manhole_ssh.TerminalSessionTransport.__init__ calls terminalSize
*after* makeConnection.

Since setting the terminal size is a sensible thing to do, and it can't
be done before the connection is made, I'm not sure that much can be
done about this. I was able to make my message stay visible by
overriding terminalSize with a version that didn't erase, but that isn't
very clean or general.

Message-ID: <8D500168-E7FE-4EDF-874E-B82E0AB60B89@atleastfornow.net>

Hello everyone!

Another few months, another Twisted release. This one has a few more Py3 goodies in it!

- twisted.positioning, the rest of twisted.internet.endpoints, KQueueReactor (for real this time), twisted.web.proxy/guard, and Trial (!!!) have all been ported to Python 3.
- Twisted officially supports several more platforms: Py3.4 on FreeBSD, Py2.7/Py3.4 on Fedora 21/22, and Py2.7 on RHEL7.
- Python 2.6 is no longer supported, and support for Debian 6, and RHEL6 has been removed because of this.
- Support for the EOL'd platforms of Fedora 17/18/19 has been removed.
- Twisted has moved to requiring setuptools for installation.
- twisted.python.failure.Failure's __repr__ now includes the  exception message.
- 19 tickets in total closed!

As usual, you can find the tarball and newsfile at http://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/15.4.0pre1/ ! Please download them, test them, share them, appreciate them, make them a little nest so that they are comfortable. If there aren't any reported issues, this will be getting a full release soon.

Twisted Regards,

Amber "Hawkie" Brown

Message-ID: <CAJYM=XJzx3ijz5PigrtLshwPjy8m+OWmabvWB+eDhPALgb6xMg@mail.gmail.com>

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4759 -- I tried to post as a
comment in the Trac ticket but "SpamBayes determined spam probability
of 93.78%".

Same issue but w/Linux; I've been hacking around at it for a bit and
found a few things that might be helpful.  I am on old twisted
(12.1.0) using a backported protocols.memcache so this could be
self-inflicted.

Inside epollreactor doPoll() I added sanity checks to log when
_poller.poll() gives us an event flagged for READ on a fd that is
_not_ in self._reads (and similarly with writes).  Low and behold,
gobs of hits.  Unexpected.

So I took a closer look.  It appears to me that _epoll.epoll() is
emitting events that are outside of the flags that epollreactor
carefully registers.  Filtering them out in doPoll seems to avoid this
particular traceback but it also breaks the world.  At least in my
system this appears to be the expected behavior.

So (to restate and summarize) asserting on addWriter() doesn't do
anything because the Port was added by addReader().  Despite only
being in _reads() and being registered with _epoll.EPOLLIN, doPoll()
is getting write events which it happily passes through to
_doReadOrWrite which checks the event flag, sees it as a _POLL_OUT and
tries to write it.

I'll try the obvious (upgrade twisted to current) and see what happens.

I've retrained the spam filter so hopefully you won't have this issue in the future.  I do make the point of training spambayes every day and we have few false positives like this - sorry about that!  If it makes you feel any better it properly rejected about 30 spams per one message of yours it rejected ;-).

Would you mind re-posting this to a comment, as it should work now?  If you have more problems with the spam filter I'll post it myself and credit you.

I wonder, is something weird with our Mailman configuration?  Because I haven't seen any other list (some with many more subscribers) that has this regular auto-responder problem.

Nothing's changed about our configuration, so I'm not sure what has happened.  Did some other mail server change how it did auto-responses recently?

This isn't a new problem either; it's just more prevalent this year.  Typically emerges around some kind of holidays.

Hi everyone,

I've just uploaded 15.3.0pre2 to http://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/15.3.0pre2/ , which provides a small fix for Twisted-using libraries that subclass Protocol overwriting the `_log` attribute.

Please test your software with it, but as this is a very minor change, I will release it very soon.

Twisted Regards,

Amber "Hawkie" Brown

Message-ID: <2B4C122E-4DA0-4743-8D30-B0F419084098@atleastfornow.net>

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Labs, I am honoured to announce the release of Twisted 15.3.

We're marching confidently into the future, and this release demonstrates this:

	* 10+ modules ported to Python 3 (see NEWS for specifics)
 	* Twisted Lore has been removed.
	* Twisted no longer releases as 'subprojects' -- there is only one Twisted, long may it reign.
	* twistd now uses cProfile (instead of Hotshot) as the default profiler.
	* 40+ more tickets closed overall.

You can find the downloads at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted (or alternatively http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads). The NEWS file can be found at https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/trunk/NEWS .

Many thanks to everyone who had a part in this release - the supporters of the Twisted Software Foundation, the developers who contributed code as well as documentation, and all the people building great things with Twisted!

Twisted Regards,

Amber "Hawkie" Brown

Subject: [Twisted-Python] failing coverage builders
Message-ID: <0F605D53-2798-4447-8CD2-19857D1A4ED1@twistedmatrix.com>

The python 3.4 coverage builders are failing, apparently because one of the builders is down:

<https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/debian7-py3.4-coverage/builds/399/steps/shell_5/logs/stdio <https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/debian7-py3.4-coverage/builds/399/steps/shell_5/logs/stdio>>

I'll probably make those builders unsupported later today if there is no obvious fix; at this point, depending on codecov is mostly just a net negative.  We can't have it reasonably fail our builds or report status for us, and "coverage html" produces perfectly usable coverage reports, and so the main consequence is that our builds will fail if they're down (or if they introduce a version of coverage on PyPI that doesn't support python 3, apparently?)

Hi Glyph,

I'll take a look.

I find the combined codecov rather valuable for figuring out what isn't covered on either, but I'll remove it for now.

I already removed it earlier, so that should be easy :-).

Raw coverage can do combining, if we can just ship the files somewhere:

http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/cmd.html#cmd-combining <http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/cmd.html#cmd-combining>

But, perhaps we should just not fail the build if codecov submission fails.

Hi all,
I am using Twisted to make a game server. I want to be able to ban IP 
addresses. Currently I check if the host is in a blacklist, and if it 
is, call abortConnection on the transport. It works fine, but I'm 
thinking there should be a better way, to actively refuse the connection 
in the first place?

Cheers,

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Updates on the Twisted Buildbots
Message-ID: <EF5EDAF8-1785-42B0-AA03-AA61520DD402@atleastfornow.net>

Hi everyone,

If you haven't looked at the buildbots for a while, there's been some changes! (for brevity's sake, unsupported builders will be prefixed with a U, eg "U2.7")

- Fedora 17 (2.7), 18 (2.7), 19 (2.7, 3.3), and RHEL6 (2.6) are removed, and replaced by RHEL7 (2.7), Fedora 21 (2.7, 3.4), Fedora 22 (U2.7, U3.4, to be fixed very soon, UPyPy2.4). RHEL6 will return with the 2.7 EPEL soon.
- FreeBSD 10.1 is supported on both Py2.7 and Py3.4.
- OS X 10.6 has been removed and OSX 10.10 has been added (2.7-select supported, kqueue and cfreactor both unsupported)
- Ubuntu 15.04 is now a supported platform (2.7, 3.4) and has unsupported PyPy (2.5) and Jython (2.7) builders.
- All of the builders (excepting Windows) are built and ran in a virtualenv. This means that they have up-to-date dependencies, and if Twisted gains dependencies, the infra team can add them to the build process easily.

Twisted Regards,

Amber "Hawkie" Brown

I am not aware of any hook in the BSD socket API that lets you refuse a connection entirely. Generally, you put a socket into ‘listen’ mode (indicating to the OS that you’ll accept new connections), and then you call accept() to get the new connection. In fact, the OS will accept the connection even before you call accept(): it’ll do it asynchronously, and you will just get the FD for the connection. IIRC Windows has a winsock specific thing that might do what you want, but that’s pretty platform specific and probably doesn’t actually prevent the connection getting established anyway.

If you really want to never allow the connection at all, you’ll probably want to program iptables (or some other firewall if you aren’t on Linux) to do the packet filtering for you. A combination of iptables and ipsets will get you a high-performance IP address blacklist that will drop all packets before they ever reach your application.

There is a shortcut in Twisted, at least, although it does not actually refuse the initial connection for the reasons listed above; you can examine the "addr" passed to IProtocolFactory.buildProtocol and return None.

Most logging systems can tell you what happened; Eliot tells you _why_
it happened:

 And here's the code that generated these logs (eliot-tree [1] was used
to render the output):

def check_links(urls):

check_links(["http://google.com"], ["http://nosuchurl"])

Thanks for that. I was sort of hoping for a Pythonic solution that doesn't rely on SubProcess ETC, particularly as I want this server to run on any OS you throw at it. Thanks for the idea though, I'll certainly use that if I get something that little Python can't handle.

This is perfect, thanks. It would have been better to refuse the connection entirely, but as Corey said, I can use iptables if I get desperate.

 Python HTTP proxy server - txtorhttpproxy
Message-ID: <CAFN1edrfiV-BFBt6YNV1QvmfFca19LsnmdrUpGGppX4A_5e+fQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Twisted/Tor developers,

I am motivated by language security concerns. I think Twisted Python
can often implement excellent replacements for our old crufty C
implementations. In this case I'd like to stop using C programs
running as root (or not root) to torify http connections... like
privoxy, polipo, apt tor transport etc.

Last year I wrote this little tor http proxy; yes it also handles RFC
2817 proxy CONNECT method as well:
https://github.com/david415/txtorhttpproxy

I wrote an AgentProxy that can proxy any sort of twisted http agent:
https://github.com/david415/txtorhttpproxy/blob/master/txtorhttpproxy/proxy.py

It used to use more terrible underscore imports but Leif fixed the
bit-rot and made it work with Twisted 15:
https://github.com/david415/txtorhttpproxy/commit/38f1a0cfab586f7a8965a47e9c8f951b351426a2

Is this project worthy of your precious 10 minutes to review it... so
I can improve the code quality?

If I get rid of this last terrible import:
from twisted.web._newclient import ResponseDone

then I'm not sure how to detect when to call the finish() method here:
https://github.com/david415/txtorhttpproxy/blob/master/txtorhttpproxy/proxy.py#L38-L52


Sincerely,
David Stainton

In https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/changeset/45163 twisted.internet.application.service.Service to be a new-style class.  Just to remind everyone, converting an old-style class to a new-style class is an incompatible change, and reviewers should look for this.

We discovered this because this change breaks https://github.com/twisted/axiom, and probably it breaks other packages as well, since lots of things inherit from Service.  So please remain diligent about looking for this in future changes.  Now that it's been changed, reverting it in 15.4 would be another incompatible change, so we probably won't do that, but please keep an eye out in the future.

Fortunately, ResponseDone is re-exported by twisted.web.client:
             
    >>> import twisted.web.client
    >>> twisted.web.client.ResponseDone is twisted.web._newclient.ResponseDone
    True
    >>> twisted.__version__
    '11.0.0'

I couldn't get 9.0 to compile in the five seconds I tried, but 11.0 is
still pretty old. I think it always was re-exported like this.

I have updated the wiki page to include this note and the reason why
we need this.

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Plan/Python3#Reviewerchecklist

Please check that wiki page is ok.

In my defense :)
Amber warned me about such changes, but when I asked (over IRC) why
they are bad I did received any convincing reason :)

I assume that this is the error in axiom:
https://github.com/twisted/axiom/issues/44

In axiom a class was defined as

class _SiteScheduler(object, Service, SchedulerMixin)

Is this a common practice?
Why do you want to have multiple inheritance and put object as the
first inherited class and not the last one?

Changing a class from old style to new style changes the method resolution
order, which is going to break lots of code in ways that we can't
anticipate. We can't find every subclass and judge whether their usage
makes sense. We can only stick to our compatibility policy
<https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CompatibilityPolicy>, which empowers
users to decide when & how they change their weird code.

The one reason that it matters is that we need to consistently tell users how to prepare for the fact that eventually, everything will be new-style.  Perhaps it will only be new-style because we eventually drop python 2, perhaps it will only be new-style because python 2.8 will deprecate classic classes, perhaps we will eventually have a flag day just to reduce the maintenance burden, perhaps each old-style class will be individually deprecated and replaced with a new-style one.  In any case, the migration will be much easier for users if they learn now that putting 'object' at the end of their bases list is a way to avoid caring about this issue entirely :).

Otherwise I agree completely with your sentiment.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] twisted on jython
Message-ID: <B58DAA66-2ED9-421D-AE7A-D38EB9CCB375@twistedmatrix.com>

We currently have an unsupported builder for Jython 2.7: <https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/ubuntu15.04-jython2.7 <https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/ubuntu15.04-jython2.7>>

This is great, so that we can fix issues that make Twisted not support Jython, but some of the bugs that are causing it not to work may be on the Jython side as well.

Hawkowl, would it be possible to set up a Jython trunk builder?  This will remain unsupported, of course, but it would give the Jython developers the ability to see how changes they make are affecting Twisted's progress to a supported version - and possibly cut a release on their end if it turns green ;).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Screen clearing in the Manhole
Message-ID: <1440520054.2262163.365674993.6595850F@webmail.messagingengine.com>

I'm making a manhole service in the usual way:

class PF(ServerProtocol):        def protocolFactory(*a, **kw):
return manhole.Manhole(namespace)

realm = manhole_ssh.TerminalRealm()    realm.chainedProtocolFactory = PF
mh_portal = portal.Portal(realm)    mh_portal.registerChecker(checker)

manhole_service = TCPServer(0, manhole_ssh.ConchFactory(mh_portal))
manhole_service.startService()

and I'd like to print a message when the terminal is opened. This
change does it:

class PF(ServerProtocol):        def protocolFactory(*a, **kw):
class Manhole(manhole.Manhole):                def connectionMade(self):
super(Manhole, self).connectionMade()
self.terminal.write('Hello')            return
manhole.Manhole(namespace)

and so does this version, which is better because
t.c.i.i.ServerProtocol.connectionMade says it is the place to
write messages:

class PF(ServerProtocol):        def protocolFactory(*a, **kw):
return manhole.Manhole(namespace)

def connectionMade(self):            ServerProtocol.connectionMade(self)
self.write('Hello')

But in both cases, after the message the screen is cleared by what looks
like a form feed, and another prompt is printed. So far I can't find
where in the code this happens. Is there a way to print a message and
not have it scrolled off the screen?

Thanks,

Peter.

As to where it happens, look at
twisted.conch.recvline.RecvLine.connectionMade() and
twisted.conch.insults.insults.TerminalProtocol.makeConnection()

You could step on the RecvLine. initializeScreen(), but I have no idea what
the side effects are. (And of course if you bypass all or part of it, even
if it works now, it's alway subject to future breakage.

t.c.r.R.connectionMade() calls self.initializeScreen(), which in turn 
calls self.terminal.reset()

I'm pretty sure s.t.reset() is actually twisted.conch.insults.reset(),
which has a bug (or an undesirable feature), it sends a "hard reset"
escape sequence to the terminal (<ESC>c).  This freaks out many terminal
emulators, and real, VT100-compatible terminals, in many different ways.

I've tested in Kermit-95, PuTTy, xterm, DECterm (a VT emulator written for
DECwindows, DEC's X implementation) and on real DEC VT420 and VT520
terminals.  They act differently, but none are pleasant.  For example, a
VT520 does a power-cycle on the CRT (which takes about 10 seconds),
reloads the saved configuration, and (if you have multiple sessions
enabled) switches to Session 1. 

The VT420 and VT520 manuals say about "hard reset", basically, "Don't
do that!!"

I have a patch to change it to send a soft reset (<ESC>[!p) and to set the
terminal into "replace mode" (<ESC>[4l) (sometimes the software thought it
was in overstrike mode, but the terminal thought it was in insert mode,
with bad results. Ideally, it would set both the software and hardware to
what ever mode the user desired.  The hard reset would set the terminal to
whichever mode was stored in its permanent settings.  For a software
terminal emulator, it was a dice roll.)

Depending on the terminal emulator or physical terminal you are using,
this probably explains your symptoms.

t.c.r.R.connectionMade() calls self.initializeScreen(), which in turn 
calls self.terminal.reset()

I'm pretty sure s.t.reset() is actually twisted.conch.insults.reset(),
which has a bug (or an undesirable feature), it sends a "hard reset"
escape sequence to the terminal (<ESC>c). This freaks out many terminal
emulators, and real, VT100-compatible terminals, in many different ways.

I've tested in Kermit-95, PuTTy, xterm, DECterm (a VT emulator written for
DECwindows, DEC's X implementation) and on real DEC VT420 and VT520
terminals. They act differently, but none are pleasant. For example, a
VT520 does a power-cycle on the CRT (which takes about 10 seconds),
reloads the saved configuration, and (if you have multiple sessions
enabled) switches to Session 1. 

The VT420 and VT520 manuals say about "hard reset", basically, "Don't
do that!!"

I have a patch to change it to send a soft reset (<ESC>[!p) and to set the
terminal into "replace mode" (<ESC>[4l) (sometimes the software thought it
was in overstrike mode, but the terminal thought it was in insert mode,
with bad results. Ideally, it would set both the software and hardware to
what ever mode the user desired. The hard reset would set the terminal to
whichever mode was stored in its permanent settings. For a software
terminal emulator, it was a dice roll.)

Depending on the terminal emulator or physical terminal you are using,
this probably explains your symptoms.

My subclass of Manhole first calls Manhole.connectionMade, which calls
HistoricRecvLine.connectionMade, which calls RecvLine.connectionMade,
which resets the screen exactly as you say. Then, after the screen has
been reset, I print the message. But then the screen is cleared a
second time!

This does sound like a scary bug, especially on a real terminal, but I
tried your patch and it didn't affect my symptom of the screen being
cleared again. That's more about "when" rather than "how".

I found it!

Manhole.terminalSize, inherited from RecvLine, does
self.terminal.eraseDisplay(). 
t.c.manhole_ssh.TerminalSessionTransport.__init__ calls terminalSize
*after* makeConnection.

Since setting the terminal size is a sensible thing to do, and it can't
be done before the connection is made, I'm not sure that much can be
done about this. I was able to make my message stay visible by
overriding terminalSize with a version that didn't erase, but that isn't
very clean or general.

Peter.

Hello everyone!

Another few months, another Twisted release. This one has a few more Py3 goodies in it!

- twisted.positioning, the rest of twisted.internet.endpoints, KQueueReactor (for real this time), twisted.web.proxy/guard, and Trial (!!!) have all been ported to Python 3.
- Twisted officially supports several more platforms: Py3.4 on FreeBSD, Py2.7/Py3.4 on Fedora 21/22, and Py2.7 on RHEL7.
- Python 2.6 is no longer supported, and support for Debian 6, and RHEL6 has been removed because of this.
- Support for the EOL'd platforms of Fedora 17/18/19 has been removed.
- Twisted has moved to requiring setuptools for installation.
- twisted.python.failure.Failure's __repr__ now includes the  exception message.
- 19 tickets in total closed!

As usual, you can find the tarball and newsfile at http://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/15.4.0pre1/ ! Please download them, test them, share them, appreciate them, make them a little nest so that they are comfortable. If there aren't any reported issues, this will be getting a full release soon.

Twisted Regards,

Amber "Hawkie" Brown

Message-ID: <CAJYM=XJzx3ijz5PigrtLshwPjy8m+OWmabvWB+eDhPALgb6xMg@mail.gmail.com>

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4759 -- I tried to post as a
comment in the Trac ticket but "SpamBayes determined spam probability
of 93.78%".

Same issue but w/Linux; I've been hacking around at it for a bit and
found a few things that might be helpful.  I am on old twisted
(12.1.0) using a backported protocols.memcache so this could be
self-inflicted.

Inside epollreactor doPoll() I added sanity checks to log when
_poller.poll() gives us an event flagged for READ on a fd that is
_not_ in self._reads (and similarly with writes).  Low and behold,
gobs of hits.  Unexpected.

So I took a closer look.  It appears to me that _epoll.epoll() is
emitting events that are outside of the flags that epollreactor
carefully registers.  Filtering them out in doPoll seems to avoid this
particular traceback but it also breaks the world.  At least in my
system this appears to be the expected behavior.

So (to restate and summarize) asserting on addWriter() doesn't do
anything because the Port was added by addReader().  Despite only
being in _reads() and being registered with _epoll.EPOLLIN, doPoll()
is getting write events which it happily passes through to
_doReadOrWrite which checks the event flag, sees it as a _POLL_OUT and
tries to write it.

I'll try the obvious (upgrade twisted to current) and see what happens.

I've retrained the spam filter so hopefully you won't have this issue in the future.  I do make the point of training spambayes every day and we have few false positives like this - sorry about that!  If it makes you feel any better it properly rejected about 30 spams per one message of yours it rejected ;-).

Would you mind re-posting this to a comment, as it should work now?  If you have more problems with the spam filter I'll post it myself and credit you.

I wonder, is something weird with our Mailman configuration?  Because I haven't seen any other list (some with many more subscribers) that has this regular auto-responder problem.

Nothing's changed about our configuration, so I'm not sure what has happened.  Did some other mail server change how it did auto-responses recently?

This isn't a new problem either; it's just more prevalent this year.  Typically emerges around some kind of holidays.
