</I>Yes.  Practically speaking these will have to be ABCs to fit into the Python stdlib idiom.
&gt;<i> A simple, potentially insane implementation for it in the stdlib -- ideally twisted.loop, but probably something like asyncore-except-slightly-less-terrible
</I>Yes.
&gt;<i> A way to write code for it, probably involving @inlineCallbacks/monocle style yields
</I>No.

In the interests of keeping the scope here as tight as possible, this is *not* a PEP about Deferreds or any of their equivalents, which are substantially more controversial.  It is _just_ about an asynchronous networking API.

The most important parts are IProtocol/ITransport/IConsumer/IProducer.  In order to do anything with these, of course, you need something somewhat like IReactorTCP/IReactorTime, but I would like to have those specified separately in the PEP, because the main interesting thing is just getting event-driven protocol logic based on a common API.  The IReactorTCP analogue would just be a stub to get started, not a complete specification of every connection mode you might want.  At the very least, there's SSL.  Plus, even in TCP, there's a lot of complexity there which you need to modify if you want to have different connection/listening options (just look at the mess on the IPv6 ticket if you think this stuff is simple).

Convenience APIs like coroutine scheduling are definitely out of scope.

&gt;<i> The idea here, as Glyph told me at Pycon, I believe, is that people can just write code that works on most backends. When they figure out the stdlib thing suck^H^H^H^Hdoesn't satisfy their requirements, we can just say &quot;hey, it's okay, you can just replace the reactor reactor you have now with the twisted one and you will get all sorts of wonderful magic to play with&quot;.
</I>
In addition, it would be a way for the stdlib to gradually start evolving towards protocol implementations which parse chunks that are fed to them rather than calling recv() and expecting to block.

&gt;<i> Am I completely wrong here already or does that sound like a sane problem definition?
</I>
Close enough :).

&gt;<i> Either way I'm planning to put the PEP draft up on github (actually, I already have). Whether you like github or not, I think this feature: <A HREF="https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button">https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button</A> is just too amazing for writing a PEP as a community process to let pass.
</I>
Cool, glad to see the project is online somewhere, finally :).
