<PRE>Hi!


I've just been in contact with Jim Fulton, who was previously mentioned in
the context of developing this PEP, and he's okay with us taking over.

IIUC the PEP involves a few things:

   1. A sane reactor abstraction/interface (although they probably won't
   like pulling in z.i.I) in the standard library which everything should be
   able to implement -- essentially twisted.loop's interface. This probably
   includes a Protocol abstraction too
   2. A simple, potentially insane implementation for it in the stdlib --
   ideally twisted.loop, but probably something like
   asyncore-except-slightly-less-terrible
   3. A way to write code for it, probably involving
   @inlineCallbacks/monocle style yields

The idea here, as Glyph told me at Pycon, I believe, is that people can just
write code that works on most backends. When they figure out the stdlib
thing suck^H^H^H^Hdoesn't satisfy their requirements, we can just say &quot;hey,
it's okay, you can just replace the reactor reactor you have now with the
twisted one and you will get all sorts of wonderful magic to play with&quot;.

Am I completely wrong here already or does that sound like a sane problem
definition?

Either way I'm planning to put the PEP draft up on github (actually, I
already have). Whether you like github or not, I think this feature:
<A HREF="https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button">https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button</A> is just too amazing
for writing a PEP as a community process to let pass.

cheers
