There are ways around this but they're a bit more work (eg, workers 
listen on a unix socket and hand out the port to new workers that start 
up and ask for it).
&gt;<i>2) the distribution of incoming connections to workers isn't completely 
</I>&gt;<i>uniformly
</I>&gt;<i>distributed across workers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This problem is explained here (they report up to 3:1 ratios of

</I>
Huh.  I didn't know about that.  That's too bad.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Not that Twisted shouldn't offer some way to gain more control over

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Correct.
&gt;<i>Would you mind giving a tip on how to make use of a CustomPort deriving
</I>&gt;<i>of Port? How to &quot;plug&quot; that into Twisted?
</I>
I have two suggestions, one of which I hope you'll like and the other of 
which you might not. :)

First, endpoints are the intended extension point for this sort of thing 
now.  You can write a plugin for the parser so that `serverFromString` 
will give out server endpoints for your port type (giving an appropriate 
string description).  Applications won't be able to tell what's going on 
because the server endpoint interface is just `.listen(factory)Â´.

Second, please don't subclass `Port`.  It's true there are no 
underscores anywhere in its name (`twisted.internet.tcp.Port`) making it 
part of Twisted's public API.  Nevertheless, it's very much a reactor 
implementation detail.  It's a mistake that it's public.  To compounded 
this, the exactly interface between a class and its subclasses is hazy 
and gross at best.  I'd discourage you (and everyone else) from 
subclassing *most* things in Twisted these days (lots of our APIs are 
still subclassing-oriented so it's not always possible to avoid, of 
course).

In this case, I think you might actually be able to re-use all of the 
important parts of `Port` without subclassing it.  You can create a 
bare-bones implementation of `IListeningPort` that creates a socket and 
sets the flags you want on it.  Then, use `reactor.adoptStreamPort` to 
get the reactor to create and initialize a new `Port` with your socket. 
This leaves you with a little code to duplicate (basically 
`createInternetSocket`) but a pretty small amount - and the upside is 
that you're totally isolated from the internals of `Port`, from the 
accidentally-public implementation details of `Port`, and even from the 
implementation detail of whether the reactor even *uses* `Port` or not. 
All you rely on is `reactor.adoptStreamPort` which is a nice, 
documented, tested, intentionally-public interface. :)

(For SSL, then you can wrap your own twisted.protocols.tls wrapper 
around the factory - which is all the reactor's listenSSL does these 
days, anyway).

Hope this helps,

Jean-Paul
