Let suppose that I need work done by doWork function.
It returns a deferred for me to hang call backs and error backs on.

	d = doWork()
	d.addCallback(handleWorkDone)

In my handleWorkDone I expect to get the result of doWork completing.

The assert fires if instead of a result value is returned a Deferred is 
returned. This I consider a bug in the doWork() implementation.

What must happen in doWork is that it must arrange that
any Deferred it used internally has an addCallback used to
cause the d returned to the user to complete. Leaking the
any internal Deferred() objects must not happen to the user
of doWork.

def doWork():
	d = Deferred()

	def completeWork(result, d):
		d.callback(result)

	inner_d = doAsyncWork()
	inner_d.addCallback(completeWork, d)

	return d

The error message would need to say something like:
&quot;Cannot return a Deferred as a result. Did you forgot to addCallback to the 
deferred?&quot;

Maybe add something to docs based on the above and refer to it in the message?
