Sorry, some typos in there are not helping ;-(

&gt;<i> Breaking it down:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you have no reference to the object being calls,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How do you have no reference to the object being called? Aren't you

</I>
That test case I linked to shows one example, the original ones were 
from abstracting out JML's original post here:
<A HREF="https://jml.io/pages/how-to-disconnect-in-twisted-really.html">https://jml.io/pages/how-to-disconnect-in-twisted-really.html</A>

&gt;<i> In any case you either have a Deferred or you don't; if you do, then 
</I>&gt;<i> it's clear you should wait on it,
</I>
Yes, but where to wait is the question here. I'd like to leave that 
choice to the user (see back in the thread for the details).

&gt;&gt;<i> This is the test situation where I hit this issue:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/cjw296/carly/blob/master/tests/test_untracked_deferred.py#L28-L35">https://github.com/cjw296/carly/blob/master/tests/test_untracked_deferred.py#L28-L35</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd originally wanted to have that read:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    @inlineCallbacks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    def test1(self):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        result = yield pita.asyncMethod.called()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        with ShouldRaise(Exception(1)):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>            yield result
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, which I'm actually happier with the end result here, I think the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> above it legit, if unusual, and that assert trips it up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some type annotations might make it a bit clearer what the two states 
</I>&gt;<i> here are :).  
</I>
If those annotations were there, what would they look like? (I did link 
to the whole test file, which has all the detail I think you could need, 
it's pretty self contained and not that long)

&gt;<i> As it is, it looks to me you want a Deferred to come *out* 
</I>&gt;<i> of a 'yield', which should definitely never happen. 
</I>
I disagree, in this specific case.

&gt;<i> If this assert were 
</I>&gt;<i> to be removed, it would be done in such a way that would implicitly wait 
</I>&gt;<i> for the Deferred in question to fire: you should /never/ receive a 
</I>&gt;<i> Deferred as an argument to a function, or as the result of an 
</I>&gt;<i> (inlineCallbacks) 'yield' or (async def) 'await'.  It breaks the whole 
</I>&gt;<i> model of what 'awaiting' means.
</I>
Well, I'd agree 90% of the time, but test_untracked_deferred.py is where 
that's no always true.

Anyway, I'm happy with the API I have now, and it neatly works around 
that assert, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
