Glyph, this bit ^^^

Yeah, this is part of carly, that I posted earlier. It stems from the 
need to get the results of method calls when you have no reference to 
the object being calls, or sometimes a result that's a deferred you need 
to wait on, particularly in a test, but have no way of doing so.

If you're feeling brave, have a read of:
<A HREF="https://github.com/cjw296/carly/blob/master/carly/hook.py">https://github.com/cjw296/carly/blob/master/carly/hook.py</A>

&gt;<i> The assertion in question only happens if you call returnValue or do a 
</I>&gt;<i> return with a Deferred directly; this example doesn't do either of 
</I>&gt;<i> those things.
</I>
This is the test situation where I hit this issue:
<A HREF="https://github.com/cjw296/carly/blob/master/tests/test_untracked_deferred.py#L28-L35">https://github.com/cjw296/carly/blob/master/tests/test_untracked_deferred.py#L28-L35</A>

I'd originally wanted to have that read:

@inlineCallbacks
def test1(self):
...
result = yield pita.asyncMethod.called()
with ShouldRaise(Exception(1)):
yield result

Now, which I'm actually happier with the end result here, I think the 
above it legit, if unusual, and that assert trips it up.

cheers,

Chris
