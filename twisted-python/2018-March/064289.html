<PRE>Hi,

It is not clear to me what builders need to pass before we can merge something.

I expect that all supported &quot;platforms&quot; need to pass, but it is not
clear what are the currently supported platforms.

We have this info in the wiki but it does not help.
<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReviewProcess#Authors:Howtomergethechangetotrunk">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReviewProcess#Authors:Howtomergethechangetotrunk</A>

In GitHub I can see Travis / Appveyor and OSX from Buildot as &quot;Required&quot;

Is that all?

----------

If I check the &quot;supported&quot; group in Buildbot, I see many more builders.
The problem is that a significant number of slaves are down and those
builders are not available.

--------

Is Fedora still supported and required?

-------

I suggest to use GitHub &quot;Required&quot; marker to document what platforms
are supported.

We don't have time to maintain the infrastructure, so I suggest to
drop support for anything that is not supported by Travis and
Appveyor.

I know that this might be disruptive.
I think that we need it in order to raise awareness that supporting a
platform is not easy.
If someone (including me) cares about a platform they should find a
way to help to project supporting that platform.

What do you think?
