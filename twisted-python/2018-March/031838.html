All the twisted list got was the original letter from the SFC without a &quot;false alarm&quot; followup. By the time people pointed it out, it was too late.

Thanks for the explanation; I was tearing my hair out (what little remains, anyway) trying to figure out what the heck had happened! :)  I do remember that ill-fated email.  Normally I'd say we should never deprovision infrastructure until it's torn, bloody, from our lifeless hands, but the way the free Rackspace account is set up means overages go to bill the SFC and deplete their general fund, so I can see not wanting to have anything unnecessary hanging around there if the discount were to end.

(For those of you that may not have been informed at the time: <A HREF="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/20/rackspace_ends_discount_hosting_for_open_source_projects/">https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/20/rackspace_ends_discount_hosting_for_open_source_projects/</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/20/rackspace_ends_discount_hosting_for_open_source_projects/">https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/20/rackspace_ends_discount_hosting_for_open_source_projects/</A>&gt; )
