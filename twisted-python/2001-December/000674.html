Currently you can't.  This is the first request I'm aware of to be made
aware of the actual errno that caused the connection to fail; the
distinction between connectionFailed and connectionLost seemed to be the
big one.

The place you'd have to fix would be
twisted.internet.tcp.Connection.(doRead|writeSomeData).  Similarly in
twisted.internet.udp.  Patches accepted :-).

&gt;<i> Also, how can I determine if Linereceived.sendLine() (or 
</I>&gt;<i> Protocol.Transport.write()) failed? It doesn't seem to return an
</I>&gt;<i> error value or raise Exceptions, and depending on the invocation

</I>
If you need this level of guarantee, you need a protocol which will send
acks for messages as they've been received.  There is no such thing as
&quot;too asynchronous&quot; -- there is &quot;synchronous&quot;, &quot;asynchronous&quot;, and
&quot;sometimes stuck doing something with one client while the rest of the
server hangs...&quot; :-).

This is the same question as previously, really; if a write &quot;fails&quot;,
then the connection has been lost.  Knowing that a connection failed
during a write and getting an errno would give you all the same
information.

Keep in mind that a write &quot;succeeding&quot; might just mean that the memory
was succesfully copied into a buffer for your OS kernel to send; the
other side of the connection may never have received it.
