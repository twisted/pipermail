<PRE>(Yes, Glyph, I know it leads to increased sexual potency.)

The really short version of this email: What features/tools/etc. does Twisted 
offer, how do they differ from conventional APIs/programs, and what do they 
do?  (E.g. Sessions vs. cookies, Widgets, Passport....)  What would 
its &quot;feature list&quot; look like?

The longer version:

The recent message about CGI/Sessions got me wondering how Twisted differs from 
other 'net frameworks, and how I can capitalize on its advantages.  For 
example, I'm planning on running a blog on top of Twisted (all I need is a 
computer to code on...:P).  On a standard web server, I'd probably set most of 
it up as CGIs, at least initially, and use cookies for dealing with &quot;members&quot; 
and such.  But Twisted's got these things called Sessions and Passports, and 
I've seen a lot of bits thrown about in regard to Widgets.  And there's 
probably a lot of stuff I haven't heard about.

I know there's the &quot;Why Twisted?&quot; section, but it's *extremely* high-level, 
basically saying &quot;It's written in Python, has a bunch of different protocols 
that can interface, and is well-supported,&quot; which is like someone handing you a 
tool box and telling you, &quot;There are some really useful tools in here.  They're 
like ones you may have heard about, but better.&quot;  &quot;So...why are they better?  
What do they do?  Why would I want this tool set over a different one?&quot;

I realize at least part of this comes from my ignorance regarding network 
programming; I'm basically a neophyte when it comes to that.  Otherwise, I 
could probably dive into the code and figure out what does what, and how it's 
different or better than the way things are normally done.  As it is, I 
wouldn't know where to start.  Once I know what the parts are and what they do, 
I should be able to use my m4D Py7h0n sKi11Z (;-}) to figure out the &quot;how&quot;.

Thanks in advance,

Mike
