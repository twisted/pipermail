</I>&gt;<i> The layers are:

</I>&gt;<i> 1. Physical - hardware
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Data Link - ethernet
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Network - IP
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Transport - protocols(TCP/IP, UDP)
</I>
When we start marketing twisted.internet hardware that you can use to
speak TCP/TIP, I'll let you know :-)

&gt;<i> 5. Session
</I>
It depends on the appplication.  Normally, this is managed by TCP itself
and is represented by a twisted.protocols.protocol.Transport instance. 
In broken, &quot;stateless&quot; protocols like HTTP, we have explicit session
management (twisted.web.server.Session); for many applications it's
unnecessary.  I guess in some cases this level doesn't exist?  When
you're using twisted.spread, the session is the Broker; Perspectives are
just one of the things that can be attached to the Broker.  Similarly to
web sessions.

&gt;<i> 6. Presentation
</I>
This apparently involves quite a few different things.  As you noted,
it's a computationally expensive place, this is where some optimizations
have already started to happen.  banana and jelly are at this level;
banana has been optimized into C.  (Yes, itamar, one of these days I
will integrate Elliot's changes)  Jelly is another candidate.

&gt;<i> 7. Application
</I>
&quot;User Code&quot;, I guess :)

&gt;<i> I'm not sure how &quot;session&quot; fits in with Twisted. Maybe Perspectives play the
</I>&gt;<i> role of sessions?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Presentation is defined as &quot;where application data is packed/unpacked&quot; -
</I>&gt;<i> which seems to include both banana and jelly?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to be able to draw a diagram showing where python fits into this
</I>&gt;<i> model and where the opportunities for optimization are found. By explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> showing that the implentations of these layers are actually in C or provided
</I>&gt;<i> by the OS, the perception that &quot;python is slow&quot; could be mitigated somewhat.
</I>
Well, at least 4.5 layers out of 7 are provided by hardware or C code
:<i>-)  (Python itself is in C, after all; doesn't that make it fast?)
</I>
&gt;<i> I think that keeping the &quot;session&quot; layer in python can be justified with the
</I>&gt;<i> added security of no buffer overflows, and the requirement for integration
</I>&gt;<i> with the python application layer. There also are few tight loops in this
</I>&gt;<i> layer.
</I>
After reading a bunch of OSI documents on this layer listing, I'm not
sure what *code* this layer actually refers to.  Session management and
flow control on the TCP level are done by the kernel; and a lot of
buffer overflows happen in the Presentation layer as well.

&gt;<i> The &quot;Presentation&quot; layer seems to be the most computationally expensive
</I>&gt;<i> software layer as it includes encryptions, packing and compression. It is
</I>&gt;<i> here that the pure python implentation is a little scary for most people -
</I>&gt;<i> and so it is here where the most education and explicit categorization of
</I>&gt;<i> components by implementation would be most useful.
</I>
More heavily optimized stuff at this layer would always be good, but I
would prefer to sacrifice as little safety as possible; there's always
the potential to mishandle data; especially if you count encryption in
this layer -- data which makes it through the encryption layer just fine
might still require processing that makes it dangerous to do in C.

That said, Twisted uses a C SSL implementation currently, and I
certainly have no plans to rewrite that in python.  I think that SSL is
probably good enough for the encryption layer, and it's well-tested.
Most of the problems I've had with it are build-related, although Moshe
may want to roll his own OpenSSL bindings to help resolve some of that.
