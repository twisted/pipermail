</I>
This was the way Twisted originally worked; we wrote a TON of code and
this parameter was never used :-).  Feel free to add it, though; your
connectionFailedWithError approach sounded like a good one.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Also, how can I determine if Linereceived.sendLine() (or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Protocol.Transport.write()) failed? It doesn't seem to return an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; error value or raise Exceptions, and depending on the invocation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of connectionLost makes things perhaps too asynchronous..
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you need this level of guarantee, you need a protocol which will send
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; acks for messages as they've been received.  There is no such thing as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;too asynchronous&quot; -- there is &quot;synchronous&quot;, &quot;asynchronous&quot;, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;sometimes stuck doing something with one client while the rest of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; server hangs...&quot; :-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, you could return an error if the connection is obviously closed
</I>&gt;<i> already (and perhaps return the error received when the connection was
</I>&gt;<i> close asynchronously) - i.e. when it's clear that the async. write will
</I>&gt;<i> fail. The rest can be handled right away. [snip]
</I>
I *could*, but why would I?  This means that your errors have to be
handled in two places instead of one, and it will only *sometimes*
actually be handled by one of those two places, depending on the OS
buffer sizes and the direction of prevailing winds.

There are lots of places where a connection can be dropped, and there
are lots of reasons for it.  Unifying them into a single &quot;connection has
been lost&quot; failure path is in general a good thing; I could understand
wanting more information about that failure (your previous request) but
wanting the failure case to be exposed to your code through numerous
paths -- all of which must be handled and the distinction between which
is VERY difficult to test -- seems like a naive regression to a
lower-level API.

&gt;<i> &gt; Keep in mind that a write &quot;succeeding&quot; might just mean that the memory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was succesfully copied into a buffer for your OS kernel to send; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other side of the connection may never have received it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I basically meant succeeding as with socket.recv/send().
</I>
Why is this useful information to have at the application layer?
