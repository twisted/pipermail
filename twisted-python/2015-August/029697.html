I cut and pasted some context so people know what I'm talking about.)

t.c.r.R.connectionMade() calls self.initializeScreen(), which in turn 
calls self.terminal.reset()

I'm pretty sure s.t.reset() is actually twisted.conch.insults.reset(),
which has a bug (or an undesirable feature), it sends a &quot;hard reset&quot;
escape sequence to the terminal (&lt;ESC&gt;c). This freaks out many terminal
emulators, and real, VT100-compatible terminals, in many different ways.

I've tested in Kermit-95, PuTTy, xterm, DECterm (a VT emulator written for
DECwindows, DEC's X implementation) and on real DEC VT420 and VT520
terminals. They act differently, but none are pleasant. For example, a
VT520 does a power-cycle on the CRT (which takes about 10 seconds),
reloads the saved configuration, and (if you have multiple sessions
enabled) switches to Session 1. 

The VT420 and VT520 manuals say about &quot;hard reset&quot;, basically, &quot;Don't
do that!!&quot;

I have a patch to change it to send a soft reset (&lt;ESC&gt;[!p) and to set the
terminal into &quot;replace mode&quot; (&lt;ESC&gt;[4l) (sometimes the software thought it
was in overstrike mode, but the terminal thought it was in insert mode,
with bad results. Ideally, it would set both the software and hardware to
what ever mode the user desired. The hard reset would set the terminal to
whichever mode was stored in its permanent settings. For a software
terminal emulator, it was a dice roll.)

Depending on the terminal emulator or physical terminal you are using,
this probably explains your symptoms.
