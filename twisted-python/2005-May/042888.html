<PRE>One detail:

The social scene around Twisted currently features a lot of &quot;verbal violence
humor&quot;.  This is very frequent on the IRC channel, and probably its
practitioners don't notice how often it occurs (because shared social customs
quickly become unnoticed by their practitioners).  In this e-mail thread,
someone wrote that people who say Twisted has no docs ought to be stabbed in the
face.  Obviously, this was intended as humor, but I believe that this social
custom, along with as other related social customs in Twistedland, deter people
from some other cultures from participating.

NB: I'm not saying it's &quot;bad&quot;.  I'm not saying it's unfunny.  I'm not even
necessarily saying that you folks should try to change it -- maybe it works for
you and the &quot;social exclusion&quot; factor is not a big enough problem to warrant a
change.  All I'm saying is that verbal violence humor, interpersonal aggression
humor, and such customs limit the growth of your project by turning off people
from outside your own specific (sub-)culture.

Regards,

Zooko
