(This contains my thoughts on Twisted's state in general, this thread,
and a response to this particular point from Glyph):

As it stands, I'm pretty embarassed about the state of Twisted, and
I'm really sympathetic for Mike. Personally, I'm truly sorry I had to
drop a lot of polish from the Twisted 2.0 release; I decided to make
it a higher priority to get it out the door (its release cycle was
nearing Debian scales) than to get API docs building, for example.

While there are a lot of docs, and people who claim &quot;Twisted has no
docs!&quot; should be stabbed in the face, the level of usefulness in the
docs isn't that, well, useful, despite Mary's excellent effort. Not
only that, the code is also really nasty in certain areas, trial being
particularly relevant, but certainly not the only area. Trial is
something I've worried about for a while and have eventually just lost
all hope of general usability for, if you're not a Twisted expert.

To respond to your question, glyph, the only thing I can imagine
helping Twisted a significant amount right now is if some company
employing a Twisted hacker would give that Twisted hacker half a day a
week to *generally* maintain Twisted. Just those 4.5 focussed hours a
week would help an amazing amount, I reckon. Not just working on the
web site and docs, but the code as well, like fixing bugs in the
tracker. Of course, most of those companies that employ us do pay us
for developing certain contributions to Twisted, but that's not really
benefitting the project as a whole, it's just benefitting very small
niches within it.

Unfortunately, all of the companies employing Twisted hackers (Divmod,
Nunatak, ITA, and some others) are either too poor or don't care
enough about Twisted to make that offer.

Barring that, maybe a horde of uni students with tons of time on their
hands could help.
