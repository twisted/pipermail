</I>dont know why you are so reluctant to say that. It also saves one from 
doing a lot of unproductive coding when the basic design can be put down 
on paper and analysed by peers to eliminate bad ideas from the beginning 
- I suppose that was the original motivation for something like UML - 
please don't shoot me :-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) If the intent of the module/class/etc is not known beforehand, how 
</I>&gt;<i> does one determine if it is working right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That sums it up pretty well.

&gt;<i> I don't mean to criticize, but this is in my eyes the greatest 
</I>&gt;<i> weakness of Twisted. My experiences with it, when it works, is that it 
</I>&gt;<i> works wonderfully.

Twisted is a superb framework. Once I took a few days of and hacked my 
way through its enigmatic depths I also whispered to myself ... 
eureka... I'm not sure though that documentation is the *only* problem. 
My experience tells me that basic concepts around the &quot;networking layer&quot; 
is intimidating  to a lot of  developers.

&gt;<i> I tell you: if it gets to the point where I SERIOUSLY consider writing 
</I>&gt;<i> my own simple frame work to get a job done as a TIME SAVING MEASURE 
</I>&gt;<i> then there is a problem, and I do not believe I am alone in this 
</I>&gt;<i> perception.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I normally ask myself how long will it take to understand this stuff - 
given the state of the documentation. Then I compare it to how long it 
would take to write it myself. Lets be frank - &quot;open source&quot; assumes to 
an extent that you would actually &quot;read the source&quot; as part of the 
documentation. To me the detail (like the API) is not the problem.

I would love to see high level conceptual documentation to give me a 
better idea of  basic concepts  like the &quot;reactor&quot;, &quot;application&quot;, 
&quot;service&quot;, &quot;transport&quot;,&quot;protocol&quot;, &quot;factory&quot; - what they are supposed to 
do and how they are  to fit together.
