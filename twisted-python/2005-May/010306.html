That's why it's better if you don't install Twisted, just make its  
source code part of your project.  That's what you should be doing  
for just about any dependency, especially those where you don't need  
extension modules.

Debugging with an audience?  What the hell were you thinking?  Don't  
do that.

&gt;<i>     * At which point my colleague (lead on this project) got well and

</I>
The deferred/generator stuff is probably &quot;plain-old-looking&quot; enough  
to be used by a programmer who isn't already used to the Twisted  
style of programming, with caveats of course.
