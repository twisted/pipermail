I'd estimate ten years, as with any such project :) -

Double-awesome!

Yes.  I was the original developer, and as far as I know very little has 
happened since I was working on it.  The chat client part of words still 
  uses 1.0-era deprecated APIs, and has a gtk1 user interface!

Much of the code's design is also horrible, as it was written more as a 
proof of concept.  Still, I strongly believe that words is where a good 
bit of Twisted's potential lies.  A lot of what's being done with 
Twisted now could theoretically be done with apache, but once chat 
protocols start getting into the mix there are very few things that can 
compete.
