That's going to be a really hard thing to find. For instance, as far as I'm 
aware, there's no-one being paid to work on Python - I spend a small amount 
of work time on it, but certainly nowhere near half a day a week. (I 
generally take a half day or day off when it comes to cutting a release). 
If we can't find companies to fund work on Python (a much, much more
visible project, with a whole pile of companies relying on it) I don't hold 
out much chance for someone funding Twisted as a whole. 

Having said that, I *could* see people being able to justify time on various 
Twisted subprojects because they need it for work. 

And yes, trial needs to be dropped off a bridge.
