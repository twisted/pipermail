Hmm, can't see that flying with our sysadmins, they want standard
packages with minimal apps that use them (NetBSD developer).

Pair programming *always* has an audience, in this particular case we
just had the third programmer looking over our shoulder because we'd
just been debating the merits of Twisted and he wanted to see how it
compared to his own experiences with Twisted.  Going back to my
&quot;cubicle&quot; (actually apartment) would have involved making the pair
programming remote (which is common in our company), the difference
being that I could do the looking up/spelunking *before* I called over
to start work ;) .

</I>
Quite possibly it would be, but I'm afraid the cow is already in the
corn for this project.  We'll see if they are won over by the beauty and
majesty of the big Twisted project when/if they start working on that.

Have fun,
Mike
