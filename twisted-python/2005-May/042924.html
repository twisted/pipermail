  I'd be interested to hear about the relative performance of your two solutions.  I would expect DeferredSemaphore to create many more Deferreds, and thus perhaps perform less well.

  Also, Glyph and I did some work for Quotient today on some code which may be applicable to this kind of problem.  Here's an example:

    from twisted.internet import defer
    from atop.tpython import Cooperator

    def parallel(iterable, count, callable, *args, **named):
        source = iter(iterable)
        def work():
            for elem in source:
                yield callable(elem, *args, **named)
        coop = Cooperator()
        tasks = []
        for i in range(count):
            tasks.append(coop.coiterate(work()))
        return defer.DeferredList(tasks)

  Note that this returns a DeferredList of each &quot;task&quot;, rather than of each result.  If results are desired as well, adding a callback (before yielding) to the result of callable() inside work() which saved the result, then adding a callback to the DeferredList which discarded the list of task results and returned the saved results would accomplish this.

  Note also that Cooperator is in a branch at the moment.  It'll most likely be in Quotient trunk sometime tomorrow.
