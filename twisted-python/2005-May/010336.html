In my experience (on Jabber and a few smaller projects), the hardest
thing is finding people who want to write docs. Developers don't want 
to do it or don't have the time, and most folks who like to write are
not especially technical. They might write a howto for end users, but 
documenting something like Twisted is beyond their ken. In the Jabber
world I have been writing docs since mid-2000 but even so I mostly
focus on protocol documentation because writing docs for various
implementations (libraries, servers, clients) would be never-ending.

My $0.02.
