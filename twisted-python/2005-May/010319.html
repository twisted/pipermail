Sysadmins be damned, the more self-contained an application is, the  
less trouble you'll have debugging, developing, and upgrading it.   
ESPECIALLY since Python can't reasonably do multiple-concurrent- 
versions (effectively our own DLL hell).

The way you said it kind of implied that more than 2 people were  
present, and that these were non-programmers.
