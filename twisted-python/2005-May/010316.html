Lacking community volunteers with the necessary writing and twisted
skillsets, the best option would be to have the documentation done
professionally by *good* technical writers.

How does one fund this?  As you say, there are tens of thousands of twisted
users by now,  many writing code inside corporations/universities which 
regularly
pay for software.  So start a fund:

- get an accurate estimate of the amount of money needed (ie., have 
*good* writers
   lined up and ready to start work under contract)
- prominently display the fund status (thermometer?) on the twisted home 
page
- solicit support from twisted users urging them to get their employers 
to contribute
- recognize contributions

I think you'd be pleasantly surprised by the response.  $150k shouldn't 
be too hard
to raise and, spent wisely, will go a long way towards solving the 
documentation/tutorial
problems.  Our group put $12.5k back into a specific open source project 
last year.
Money that was earned thanks to that same project.

Cheers,
Darran.

P.S.  Of course a paper book would also do wonders ...
