I understand that Guido has a certain amount of Python time written
into his contract, but much of this is spent attending conferences and
so on.

Python appears to have more worker bees than Twisted who do the kind
of general work radix was asking for, despite none of them being paid
to do it; this is probably mostly a function of just being a bigger,
more visible project (after all, every Twisted user is a Python user).

&gt;<i> (I generally take a half day or day off when it comes to cutting a
</I>&gt;<i> release).  If we can't find companies to fund work on Python (a
</I>&gt;<i> much, much more visible project, with a whole pile of companies
</I>&gt;<i> relying on it) I don't hold out much chance for someone funding
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted as a whole.
</I>
Of course, the PSF has a certain amount of money and while none of it
has been spent directly on Python so far, some of it has gone on
producing training material (for scientists).  I personally doubt that
the PSF would find funding the production of such material
sufficiently in line with its interests but if noone asks, we'll never
knows.
