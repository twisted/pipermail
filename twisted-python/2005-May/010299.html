Thanks! I realize this is probably a bigger effort than I can imagine
now. I'm not wedded to any packaging structure, really. The most
important thing right now is getting the code out there.

Most of my longish message was thinking out loud and certainly helped me
to get an idea of a restructuring of the code. Also, I can follow the
reasoning of keeping it inside Words at the moment. We'll see where that
leaves Xish, but let's not get ahead of myself.

I must admit that I haven't really looked into the rest of Words, but if
I understand you correctly the development there is stagnant. That's a
shame, but we can see that in the Jabber community as well: there are
very few people that bother to work on Gateways to other IM networks.
The bright side to that story is that from what I can see, the
development that /is/ there is implemented using Twisted :-)

Let's get coding.
