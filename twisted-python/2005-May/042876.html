Maybe maybe not. But right now the documentation is like a lightning rod. No 
matter what your agenda, if you want to (for whatever reason) discourage 
against the use of Twisted in a project, all you have to do is point to the 
documentation and the frazzled bunch of geeks trying to figure it all out 
:<i>-)

My experience tells me that basic concepts around the &quot;networking layer&quot;
&gt;<i> is intimidating to a lot of developers.
</I>

It would not hurt to have some nice top level documents to address that. 
That's the sort of thing you'd derive from design documentation. 

I normally ask myself how long will it take to understand this stuff -
&gt;<i> given the state of the documentation. Then I compare it to how long it
</I>&gt;<i> would take to write it myself. Lets be frank - &quot;open source&quot; assumes to
</I>&gt;<i> an extent that you would actually &quot;read the source&quot; as part of the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation. To me the detail (like the API) is not the problem.
</I>

I would have to disagree on that on a fine point. Twisted is not &quot;open 
source software that happens to be a network framework&quot;. It is a &quot;network 
framework that is also open source software&quot;. I didn't start looking at 
Twisted because it was open source. I started looking at it because I was 
interested in a better answer than I currently had for networking.

AS SUCH ... I expect the API, like any library I use, to be properly 
documented so I can start using it. I do not wish to investigate the source 
code as a recreational thing. I have a job to do and I want to get it done 
on time, on budget, and done well. Making source code delving a prerequisite 
to use of the software is bad form, in my opinion.

Yes, I find having the source code useful. Usually it's because the 
documentation leaves a fine point unclear; examining the source may resolve 
the confusion. But the source code should not be a crutch to support 
incomplete documentation - not if you want to go toe to toe with the big 
dogs.

I would love to see high level conceptual documentation to give me a
&gt;<i> better idea of basic concepts like the &quot;reactor&quot;, &quot;application&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;service&quot;, &quot;transport&quot;,&quot;protocol&quot;, &quot;factory&quot; - what they are supposed to
</I>&gt;<i> do and how they are to fit together.
</I>
