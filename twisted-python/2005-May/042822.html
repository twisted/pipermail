i.e. when YOU are in a public forum, like in front of the rest of your 
company :).

&gt;<i> Um, I hope you're joking.  Do not *ever* use a public support mechanism

&gt;<i> If that was intended more as a &quot;who do you think you are, you've not

&gt;<i> We've (and I've) *tried* to contribute back to the Twisted community

</I>
No no, you misunderstand!  Your contributions have been substantial, and 
I didn't mean to impugn them.  I don't mean, &quot;don't use IRC&quot; or &quot;you've 
got no right&quot;, I mean, you are likely to get flak, humor, or random 
people being rude to you for no reason as you are to get support.  This 
can get you in trouble in a meeting.

#twisted is like a bunch of mechanics and automotive engineers (and 
various hangers-on) hanging around in a garage.  It's not a slum, but it 
is a garage, there are going to be parts lying all over the place and 
people are informal.  Going to IRC with the president of your company 
watching your screen is like inviting your auto mechanic and his 
girlfriend into your boss's limousine to discuss the company's car 
purchasing plans for the next year.

&gt;<i> Seriously, I didn't even think of asking in IRC, it was suggested by
</I>&gt;<i> another colleague between stifling guffaws... maybe he was out to get me
</I>&gt;<i> by tricking me into exactly this folly ;) .
</I>
Hmm... sounds like maybe he was...
