I'm working on an application that would probably benefit from this 
abstraction. An example case from this app is receiving an SMS, via the 
aggregators gateway (clickatell) over http, then forwarding it to 
another &quot;user&quot; via Jabber. Doing this has had me banging on the jabber 
Twisted.Words from the 2.0 release quite a bit.

Not sure if this adds to the conversation but I wanted to say &quot;ooh, I'd 
like some of that please&quot; re Glyphs comments.
