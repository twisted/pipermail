Well, perhaps I've always misunderstood what Twisted is all about. 
From my perspective it's always seemed like an interconnected set 
of libraries, not a dedicated HTTP serverr or XMPP server or IRC 
server or whatever. (Yes, I know it does all of those and more.)
So I thought that we'd build Jabber/XMPP support into some core 
level and then someone would come along and build a full-fledged
Jabber server on top of that in a separate effort.

Now it seems that Twisted Words is an effort to build a generic 
chat server of some kind, but I've not seen a roadmap for that,
and it's not clear to me what it means to build a generic chat
server. I know what it means to build a Jabber/XMPP server, and
what it means to build an IRC server. But as far as I know there
is no such thing as the &quot;generic chat&quot; protocol. :-) So will Words
implement, say, the IRC RFCs and the XMPP RFCs and various XMPP
extensions (defined in JEPs published by the JSF) and also SIP
and SIMPLE and some less-open chat protocols such as Oscar, MSN, 
etc.? If so, how is all that stuff supposed to work together?

Just curious. ;-)

As I said, I know of several folks in the Jabber community who
are quite interested in building a reference XMPP/Jabber server
in Python, and I'm wondering if Words is the place to point them.

Thanks!

Peter
