Actually, I just realised, I fibbed about FTPClient... it does something
a little unusual, and I'm interested in opinions on this.

Say you call FTPClient.list().  You don't get a Deferred, you actually have
to pass in a Protocol *instance*, and as the data for FTPClient.list is
received, it gets passed straight to that Protocol, via dataReceived.  In
fact, the FTPClient internally makes a Factory for that connection, which
(essentially) uses that Protocol, but that's an implementation detail.  This
is a bit weird, though, because using an FTPClient involves creating
Protocols without associated Factories, and nowhere else in Twisted does
that.

[The reason why I got confused about Deferreds in the interface, is that I
use Deferreds internally in FTPClient to manage all this.]

So this is actually another interface, possibly specific to FTP, where you
pass a Protocol instance -- this allows for progressive processing of data,
rather than all-at-once, and this feels &quot;more Twisted&quot; to me :)
  
So, to parse the results of an FTP listing, you pass in a
FTPFileListProtocol... this is useful, but there probably should be a
higher-level interface to this that returns a Deferred, for when you don't
need to do custom parsing and don't care about progressive processing (i.e.
most of the time).

&gt;<i> So, as an _implementation_ strategy, the &quot;handle_FOO&quot; methods are

</I>
Agreed.  In FTP, there is, basically, only one response per request, so I
don't have need for handle_FOO in the FTPClient.  In POP3, I think the
situation is similar (but simpler than FTP).  For IRC, handle_FOO makes good
sense.
