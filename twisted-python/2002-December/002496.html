Nah, handle_FOO is useful outside of just servers (see IRCClient,
which I'll mention again in a second). It may be good to separate it
into two layers, the higher-level one returning Deferreds, which are
triggered from handle_FOO methods. This is especially useful if you
may have to wait for many low-level protocol messages before you have
the full response, but the handle_FOO idiom is nice, in general, as a
way of breaking up your protocol parsing into separate methods.

The one other place where I thought this might be useful is in
IRCClient. IRC commands often result in several messages in response
-- something like list, or whois, for example. If we wanted to
abstract this interface, we could have a &quot;list&quot; method that returned a
Deferred that didn't trigger until *all* the list lines have been
received.

So, as an _implementation_ strategy, the &quot;handle_FOO&quot; methods are
great when the mapping of message-level request to message-level
response is 1:many, and for interfaces, Deferreds are great.
