Starting a reactor is easy:
    from twisted.internet import reactor
    # Make connections, schedule events, etc, here.
    reactor.run()

Of course, there's the problem of stopping the reactor.  Most of our test
cases do something more like:
    from twisted.internet import reactor
    self.done = 0
    # Do stuff
    while not self.done:
        reactor.iterate()

Then it's just a matter of making sure you set self.done when the test
passes or fails.  You could also set timeouts with something like
&quot;reactor.callLater(3, self.blowUp)&quot;, or by calling &quot;d.setTimeout(3,
self.blowUp)&quot; on an appropriate Deferred.  You should make sure you cancel
unfired timeouts, though, or they will interfere with later tests -- this is
a deficiency in the testing framework that we're hoping to fix at some
point.

As to starting PostgreSQL, I'd just make the test assume that PostgreSQL is
running.  Perhaps use the standard synchronous interface to test that it's
running, otherwise skip the tests?
