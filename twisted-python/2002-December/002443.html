</I>&gt;<i> Good... the &quot;near future&quot; will be a good time to start :-)
</I>
And my usage of the word &quot;near&quot; is very, um, relative there ... ;^)

&gt;<i> &gt; Currently we are using the twisted xmlrpc for communication to our GUI client
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (developed using wxPython), but we also plan to have a browser interface
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (almost certainly using Woven), a SOAP interface, and quite possibly others
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (e.g., PB and/or CORBA).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wow!  Did Twisted inspire you to use such a diverse assortment of frontends, or
</I>&gt;<i> was it part of your charter and why you chose it in the first place? :)
</I>
Yes.  :^)  It *is* part of our charter (which is to integrate things), 
but the prospects of our actually being able to implement this kind of 
diversity looked pretty slim until I discovered Twisted ... 

&gt;<i> &gt; Do you plan to make your new Sessions implementation general enough to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support all of these?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a hard question to answer as asked, so I'll take this opportunity to
</I>&gt;<i> lay out my vision for how multi-protocol &quot;sessions&quot; are supposed to work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are two answers: yes, I plan to make Session part of a system general
</I>&gt;<i> enough to support all of these front-ends.  Also: no, I do not plan to make
</I>&gt;<i> Session general enough to support all these itself :-).  
</I>
This is really the best answer I could have hoped for.  

&gt;<i> ... If you've been a good
</I>&gt;<i> disciple of the Twisted Way, you'll have a Service with Perspectives that
</I>&gt;<i> represent the way that users interact with your system.  That's the focal point
</I>&gt;<i> of the conversations your users will have with your abstractions.  ...
</I>
Understood.  I'm just beginning work on the authentication aspects 
of our Service, which will use Perspectives and the dbauth stuff.  

&gt;<i> [ nice high-level explanation elided ... ]
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that this explains what how should be expecting to use the
</I>&gt;<i> authentication part of the new twisted.web.woven.guard once it's finished, but
</I>&gt;<i> feel free to ask for clarification.  I really can't think of how to express
</I>&gt;<i> this well :-).
</I>
That's just the right amount of explanation for now -- sounds like 
just the thing we'll need.  Please continue your sorcery!  

Thanks!
