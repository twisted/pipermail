Ah, yes, I knew it would be something simple -- thanks Andrew 
(and Bob).

Actually, you might want to start with the doc string for 
operationDone, which says:

        &quot;&quot;&quot;Default callback for database operation success.&quot;&quot;&quot;

I'd suggest something like:

        &quot;&quot;&quot;Template for [or &quot;example of&quot;] callback indicating 
           operation success -- subclass as desired.&quot;&quot;&quot;

I think I would have got the idea if it had said that.  
(It isn't really what I would call a default because it isn't 
called by default ... one has to explicitly call it, which, 
as you point out, isn't the intent ... kind of a nit, but 
enough to confuse a literalist such as myself ... ;^)  

I try to adhere as closely as possible to what I think is 
the design intent of the Twisted developers (since it tends to 
make life easier in the long run ;^), so doc string hints about 
subclassing, etc., are much appreciated -- as are the Twisted 
docs, of course, which are continuously improving -- thanks!  

&gt;<i> &gt; BTW, thanks for all the new twisted stuff ... I'm just starting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to use lore ... very cool!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lore's quite new though, so if you've got any feedback Moshe and I would
</I>&gt;<i> love to hear it.
</I>
Okay.  I'm setting it up for our application docs, so I should 
have some comments soon.  (I had been using LyX, which is pretty 
nice, but it's even nicer to have better integrated, all-Python 
solution. ;^)  

BTW, has anyone here checked out Leo? ... seems interesting 
and might be integrable with lore ... so many documentation 
technologies, so little time ... 

Cheers,
-- Steve.
