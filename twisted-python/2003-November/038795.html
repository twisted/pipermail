darn,  this was something I was also looking for,  but (sigh) that site
must be down right now,  I cannot get anything from that URL.   Would you
happen to know where I can find some good examples of forms processing I can
look at?     I'm still suffering from a lack of useful examples.  The Twisted
tutorial doesn't cover ANY examples of how to process forms pages.

I'm also looking for an implementation of a SMTP server.  A simple one,  just to show how all the components are tied together.   This is what Twisted really lacks,  documentation on how everything is tied together.   The tutorial covers some of that,  and does pretty good job,  but there are NO existing documentation on how to implement the simplest of SMTP servers,  although it appears there are alot of object that support it,  there just isn't any documentation that tell me how it's all tied together.
