Yeah, that looks ok too, I think.  I'm less certain though... is it possible
for this to happen:

     reactor thread                 other thread
     --------------                 ------------
                                    call callFromThread
                                      ...get reference to self.threadCallQueue
     call runUntilCurrent
       ...set self.tCQ to a new list
       ...do for loop
                                      ...append to now old threadCallQueue

So that again, a call can go missing?  Hmm, I think this is possible, so
that version is also bad.  It's also harder to reason about than my patch --
I had to disassemble it to help me think about it :)

&gt;<i>   I considered doing it this way first, but wasn't sure if anyone relied on
</I>&gt;<i> the identity of threadCallQueue (not that anyone should, but one never
</I>&gt;<i> knows).  If anyone thinks changing its identity should be avoided, I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> this version:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     def runUntilCurrent(self):
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;&quot;&quot;Run all pending timed calls.
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>         if self.threadCallQueue:
</I>&gt;<i>             calls = self.threadCallQueue[:]
</I>&gt;<i>             del self.threadCallQueue[:]
</I>&gt;<i>             for (f, a, kw) in calls:
</I>&gt;<i>                 try:
</I>&gt;<i>                     f(*a, **kw)
</I>&gt;<i>                 except:
</I>&gt;<i>                     log.err()
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That's definitely racy!  What if the call to callFromThread happens between
the &quot;calls = ...&quot; and the del statement?

A version which does
    calls = self.threadCallQueue[:]
    del self.threadCallQueue[:len(calls)]

Should be ok though, for the same reason my patch is (or at least I think it
is :)

The main difference between that version and my is this one involves a small
list copy, but it might still be faster than executing &quot;count += 1&quot; on every
loop iteration.  Either way, it's at the point where I don't care :)

&gt;<i>   I suppose reverting it entirely is an option, seeing as how no one has yet
</I>&gt;<i> *actually* been bitten by the quadratic behavior (nor does it seem likely
</I>&gt;<i> that anyone will be), but all other things equal, it's nicer to use O(N)
</I>&gt;<i> algorithms deep down in the guts of Twisted than to use O(N**2) algorithms.
</I>
I think I'd like to see it improved to have O(N) complexity too.

-Andrew.
