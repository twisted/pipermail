You should look at having a pool of worker _processes_, to which you 
dispatch work with pb.

Not threads, as python threading will not really scale, and there's 
really no point in threading if the amount of input/output to the worker 
is small enough (shared mem has its good and bad sides).

If you listen in a parent process, fork multiple children, and make the 
children accept, unix does the right thing. I don't think Twisted knows 
how to do that out of the box, but it should be doable.

That's assuming you don't need (much) shared data between the children.

&gt;<i> BTW: You might suggest to break down the expensive function into smaller 
</I>&gt;<i> pieces - no way. It has to run in one database transaction otherwise I might 
</I>&gt;<i> end up with a inconsistent database - no good in finance business.
</I>
If you are lucky, you can find a threading DB library (adbapi) that 
actually scales. The other mail in this thread are more helpful there..
