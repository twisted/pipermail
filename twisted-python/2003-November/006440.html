As a way of getting a handle on this task, can people mail me offlist
with their understanding of what the current burning issues with the
documentation are, and with wishlist documentation issues too? That
includes documents that aren't written and should be and documents that
are written that need rewriting, as well as overview problems
(&quot;documents are poorly indexed&quot; that kind of thing). Specific is better
though...

This will give me a way to start a todo list (oh, if there already is a
doc todo list, can someone tell me where it is?) that would be
considerably faster than doing a initial full review of the docs myself.
In the meantime, I'll have a look at roundup and see what I can do about
using it to keep track of doc bugs/wishlist items (I don't know whether
this would overwhelm the bug tracker with documentation bugs).

I'll summarise for the list in about a week. If you'd prefer me not to
quote your email, please let me know, otherwise I'll assume people are
OK with their responses to this mail being quoted.
