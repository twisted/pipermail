If there are better thread communication facilities in the CFRunLoop, 
then make your reactor's call[From/In]Thread use them.  There's nothing 
intrinsically useful about the waker; it's an implementation detail of 
callFromThread which could be better done in another way.

However, &quot;really slow&quot; doesn't quite describe the problem.  A server 
which sends an event to a thread without a waker and then receives a 
callFromThread may never wake up, if there isn't more network activity 
happening.
