</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a bug in my woven application which manifests itself as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; win32select failing after doing many http requests. The error is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; constant WSAENOBUFS and I it seems pretty likely that this is caused
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by some socket related resource leaking for each request I make. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hypothesis is further supported by observing that a host of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pb.ClientFactory instances are stopped when shutting down the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; application after it crashes. This seems strange to me as I am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thorough in shutting down the connector after every request is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; finished.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Turning to that trusty friend printf style debugging, shows that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PBClientFactory is stopped correctly when performing requests to pages
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that use the referenceable and wait for it's deferred's to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complete. There are two cases when it doesn't stop. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The first is when I press reload quickly a number of times. Then I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just see start messages because my request finish method is not called
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (it is a callback to the deferred returned by request.notifyFinish()).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The second case is when I call disconnect on the connector before it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deferred has been realised. I see in the log the following pattern:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Starting pb.PBClientFactory, disconnect and then the attached event,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stopping factory is not called at all. After stepping I see that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disconnect doesn't do anything when it is called before the connection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has been realized.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I have a bug, and it's in my code. My question is how does one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manage pb resources correctly and easily (I don't worry about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; performance just yet) when each user needs to have it's own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is what I have come up with so far. It doesn't solve the problem
</I>&gt;<i> where I don't get the request finish callback, but seems to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> disconnect even if not connected when disconnect is called.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> class MyPBClientFactory(pb.PBClientFactory):
</I>&gt;<i>     def disconnect(self):
</I>&gt;<i>         if not self._broker:
</I>&gt;<i>             deferred = self.getRootObject()
</I>&gt;<i>             deferred.addCallback(
</I>&gt;<i>                 lambda unused: pb.PBClientFactory.disconnect(self))
</I>&gt;<i>         else:
</I>&gt;<i>             pb.PBClientFactory.disconnect(self)
</I>
Since the last post I moved to a persistent PBClientFactory so that
disconnects is not a problem. This fixes the crashes, but there are
still resources that are not released. I only see perspective attached
messages in the log, until I kill twistd when I get a host of detached
messages. My next question must be how do I detach the perspectives in
an orderly fashion after each request? This seems to run into the same
problems as I had with not being able to do cleanup for each request.
