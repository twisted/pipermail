<PRE>i absolutely agree with all of your points. i don't have the hatred of
web-based interfaces that you guys seem to ;-), but i think that there is
definitely a bit of elitism coming into play.

we (as proud geeks) know all the google tricks and mailman preferences to
get things to behave as we like them to. but let's face it, there's more
to gaining &quot;acceptance&quot; or &quot;market share&quot;, or whatever you want to call
it, than appealing to the developers.

obviously, that is the level twisted is at now, and i agree the need for a
forum is limited at this point. but for example, pretty soon (in the
scheme of things) people are going to want to tell their bosses about
twisted. many of you seem to be fortunate to have (or be) bosses who are
willing to take a chance on a new framework. however, to clue in the PHBs
that so many of us have making decisions, a centralized, &quot;user-friendly&quot;,
web-based forum could be much more accessible.

and there's more than pointy-haired-bosses who could benefit from this,
such as the beginning web developer/administrator who may not think on the
same level, but could really make use of an apache alternative. i'm sure
you're all familiar with the state of IT in businesses today; many a
webmaster is lucky to be able to, forgive the expression, walk and chew
gum at the same time.

i think the biggest reason it might be worth investigating is because as
much as twisted is progressing as a project, i can see it forming a
community of developers willing to, again, please forgive the cliche,
&quot;think outside the box.&quot; i have seen mind-blowing levels of genius come
out of this group, so much so that i once made the statement to glyph, &quot;i
want to help, but i feel like i'm just a programmer, and all you guys are
computer scientists.&quot;

i know what you mean about using the tools that are already available, but
i think that as twisted grows, if you want the more user-oriented (as in,
non-developer-oriented) parts to be accessible, a more user-oriented
approach might be helpful.

anyways, what it comes down to is this. i've been looking for a reason to
set up this forum software i'm really fond of on my machine, but i haven't
had a reason to do so yet. i'm going to go ahead and give it a try, and
you can check it out and see if you want to bother with it or not. if not,
no big deal, and if it seems interesting and not painful to use, then we
can investigate it further...
