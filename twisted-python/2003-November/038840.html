&gt;<i> I have a bug in my woven application which manifests itself as
</I>&gt;<i> win32select failing after doing many http requests. The error is the
</I>&gt;<i> constant WSAENOBUFS and I it seems pretty likely that this is caused
</I>&gt;<i> by some socket related resource leaking for each request I make. This
</I>&gt;<i> hypothesis is further supported by observing that a host of
</I>&gt;<i> pb.ClientFactory instances are stopped when shutting down the
</I>&gt;<i> application after it crashes. This seems strange to me as I am
</I>&gt;<i> thorough in shutting down the connector after every request is
</I>&gt;<i> finished.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Turning to that trusty friend printf style debugging, shows that the
</I>&gt;<i> PBClientFactory is stopped correctly when performing requests to pages
</I>&gt;<i> that use the referenceable and wait for it's deferred's to
</I>&gt;<i> complete. There are two cases when it doesn't stop. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The first is when I press reload quickly a number of times. Then I
</I>&gt;<i> just see start messages because my request finish method is not called
</I>&gt;<i> (it is a callback to the deferred returned by request.notifyFinish()).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The second case is when I call disconnect on the connector before it's
</I>&gt;<i> deferred has been realised. I see in the log the following pattern:
</I>&gt;<i> Starting pb.PBClientFactory, disconnect and then the attached event,
</I>&gt;<i> stopping factory is not called at all. After stepping I see that
</I>&gt;<i> disconnect doesn't do anything when it is called before the connection
</I>&gt;<i> has been realized.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I have a bug, and it's in my code. My question is how does one
</I>&gt;<i> manage pb resources correctly and easily (I don't worry about
</I>&gt;<i> performance just yet) when each user needs to have it's own
</I>&gt;<i> connection?
</I>
Here is what I have come up with so far. It doesn't solve the problem
where I don't get the request finish callback, but seems to be able to
disconnect even if not connected when disconnect is called.

class MyPBClientFactory(pb.PBClientFactory):
    def disconnect(self):
        if not self._broker:
            deferred = self.getRootObject()
            deferred.addCallback(
                lambda unused: pb.PBClientFactory.disconnect(self))
        else:
            pb.PBClientFactory.disconnect(self)
