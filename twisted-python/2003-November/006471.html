OK, some results of this and later discussion is at
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/users/roundup.twistd/twisted/issue397">http://twistedmatrix.com/users/roundup.twistd/twisted/issue397</A>

I've assigned a bunch of unclaimed doc bugs in the bug tracker to myself
(hypatia), and people can assign doc bugs to me if they like. I will try
and take responsibility at least for finding someone else to do them
otherwise they will go in what will probably turn out to be quite a long
list of docs to be written by me.

The first item I am likely to look at is an overall guide to the
documentation, probably with sub-topics (&quot;multi-protocol applications
with Twisted&quot;, &quot;web development with Twisted&quot; and so on).

There's also a bit of demand for an overview of asynch network
programming and related docs on Deferreds assuming only the knowledge
given in such an overview. This is important but is not high on my own
todo list because I'm not an expert so if anyone wants to produce those
that would be excellent.

If you have comments, feel free to contact me on this list, by email
off-list, or on IRC, probably in that order of preference if you want me
to add stuff to a todo list (I'm terrible at using IRC as a todo list).
