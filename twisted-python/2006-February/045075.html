Not exactly. What I'm suggesting is a different command that you send in
addition to your regular operations. This extra command, &quot;ping&quot;, is
expected to return a result quickly; if it doesn't you know something is
wrong. That way even if your regular commands take a really long time
for the server to process you can still tell if the server itself (or
your connection to it) is ok. Every 10 seconds, say, you ping the
server; if you don't get a response back in 5 seconds it's probably
down.
