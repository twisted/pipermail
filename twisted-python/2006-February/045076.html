That's actually what I'm doing with my application - although for a different 
reason. I send a &quot;ping&quot; that immediate is answered by a &quot;pong&quot; - if I don't 
get the pong withing 30 seconds I shut the connection down.
My reason is a missconfigured firewall at one of my clients which drops 
forwarding after about 90 seconds idle time. Since I couldn't get their 
(incompetent) network admin to fix it I send a ping every 30 sec, so the 
firewall thinks the connection is active and doesn't drop it.

Luc: if you need the code for that (although it's very simple), drop me a 
line.
