I came across this problem recently. I ended up using XML-RPC.NET for
the VB side, and twsited's own XML-RPC server for my side. It took me
about a week to realise that this was how to resolve my problem,
rather than working out (in my case) how to make PB be COM-Compliant.
It had the advantage that I just passed an interface file alogn to my
VB programmer who could plug it into hsi system, and he got all his
fancy syntax checkign and pop up values and all the rest.

I did consider SOAP, but WSDL gave me a headache, and I will
apparently have to cope with a VB6 project hooking up to my code in
the near future, for which there is a COM-based XML-RPC library
available.

If it is something they're goign to be &quot;hanging&quot; on for a significant
amount of time, you can, at the very least, offer them a UUID and a
method that they can poll to see if the deferred has fired.
