Me too actually :-)

&gt;<i> I actually was trying to do this _exact_ thing (making pb appear

</I>&gt;<i> It was a flaw in my design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And after some serious reworking and acceptance of a more asynchronous
</I>&gt;<i> methodology, my program is the better for it. Way better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short, I would recommend _not_ forcing/hacking twisted to be something
</I>&gt;<i> its not. Use L. Daniel's suggestion, use a synchronous network system like
</I>&gt;<i> xmlrpclib, or rethink the meta problem your are trying to solve.
</I>
In the end it's not a flaw in the design. The software package with close to 
1.5 million lines of code runs just fine and did so for many years. 
The problem is that customers hire some homegrown MS Access programmers for 
whom anything remotely like network programming is a black box  and expect 
them to be able to write a module for my system. It's pretty hard to explain 
deferred's to someone who thinks a socket is the power outlet where he plugs 
his vacuum in and a port is the thing where the ships go to. Guess who gets 
the blame when their employees can't handle it. Thus the idea to make that 
API a bit less &quot;deferred&quot;.
Yeah - I should tell them &quot;hire decent programmers who have a clue&quot;...
Well, was worth a try - someone might have come up with something...
