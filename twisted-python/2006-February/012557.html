 &gt;&gt; If anyone could summarize the problem, and if you're serious about 
it getting fixed, I could look at it.

 &gt; Unfortunately this is not a simple problem.  It involves auditing every
 &gt; aspect of the reactor's internal state, including the threadpool, and
 &gt; validating that its internal state is consistent before terminating
 &gt; run().  It also means making sure that every buffer is flushed, all
 &gt; outstanding bytes are read, etc.  Then you have to do that for each
 &gt; reactor.  You'd also have to add an API that specifically did this kind
 &gt; of &quot;soft&quot; shutdown; flushing buffers without closing connections,
 &gt; stopping all threads, and so forth.

Mission accomplished!  You've scared me away from even wanting to do 
this!  Actually I think I'll poke around a bit.  I did spend all day 
reading the posix reactor code, and your comments here are helpful.

I think you're correct about using popen(), since I really just want 
this to work in the near future.  The data is simple enough that I think 
I can just print repr() of the data and eval it on the reader side (I 
know, I know ...).

But another thought I had was a non-twisted python implementation of PB, 
blocking on the socket calls since I'm just doing request-response.  But 
I'm guessing that would be non-trivial as well.

 &gt; However, it would certainly be a great way to learn the ins and outs of
 &gt; the reactor API.  I don't particularly want the functionality but I
 &gt; suspect that adding it will flush out some latent bugs in at least one
 &gt; reactor implementation, so I'm not opposed to seeing it done.
 &gt;
 &gt; If you would like to work on something else though, we definitely need a
 &gt; dedicated Windows maintainer ... ;)

Well, I've written Win32 and IOCP, but I currently focus on Linux. Given 
that I don't work much with Windows any more (at least not when I can 
avoid it), I don't think I'd be a good Windows maintainer, sorry. But 
I'm willing to help where I can.

Thanks for the comments.  Are you going to PyCon?  Maybe I'll bump into 
you there.  I enjoyed your talks in years past.

Eric.
