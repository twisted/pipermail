This is just my personal style of development. A bit chaotic. Sometimes
trial and error. And really a lot of git rebase -i. Whenever I find
some necessary or helpful change that could be done before porting,
put that at the top of the patch list and readjust everything.
The methodic part comes last: Look at what I changed, rethink why that
is really needed, and look for similar places I overlooked. Then generate
tickets for things that seem ready.

BTW what about Ticket 7628, news extension &quot;port&quot;? I could soon start
feeding porting tickets but if this extension is useful, I guess it
should be applied first.


&gt;<i> I think that before the Twisted project wants to call a particular

</I>
I was afraid you'd say that.
<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Plan/Python3">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Plan/Python3</A> does not explicitly
say so, maybe this should be changed. I can do that, but then I
have no write permission for the wiki.


&gt;<i> I'll let other people volunteer projects they know of - but I strongly 
</I>&gt;<i> suspect there are few or no such applications.
</I>
That makes me wonder if I really should have used PB at all. But
now I do and have no plans to change that.


&gt;<i> Again, it seems unfortunate that you have all of this work ...

</I>&gt;<i> Somewhere only you can test it.  Somewhere only you can work on it and

</I>
I believe I saw some mailing list posts where many years ago somebody
said he has spread running with PY3 but as it seems nothing of that
got into trunk. Be assured that I want to avoid that.

What is the preferred place for Twisted public repositories?
No svn please, only git.

But first I want to do some more cleaning and reshuffling, I cannot
really do that anymore with commits already pushed to a public
repository. Maybe 2 or 3 weeks.
