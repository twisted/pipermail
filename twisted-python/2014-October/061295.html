Then I would not have mentioned this. Three such changes in svn r43220.
b'remote' and two banana encoded strings. I knowingly left it at 'remote'
because I wanted to change that everywhere together.

&gt;<i> My goal is for new code being added to be as

</I>&gt;<i> these fixes later.  The time when the code is being first introduced is

</I>
I fully agree. Excluding cases where you just re-use an existing string
in one more place because then you have both 'remote' and b'remote'
in the source until you change them all (for that you have to grep
everything anyway). On the other hand, not adapting existing code
to changed guidelines right when they are changed always generates
a lot of such inconsistencies, so this one is really peanuts.
(I know - more manpower is always needed). This is actually a small
problem for me because I rather copy the style of existing code 
instead of reading boring guidelines.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;if possible __execute__ (not __define__) only one assert per test
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm.  Yes?  I'm not sure.  What do you have in mind here?
</I>
svn r43207 Split up the test with multiple assertions into several tests

There you unfolded the loop. If the real reason was the different 
constructions of the type names (like &quot;__builtin__.type&quot;), I would
have expected a different commit text, and of course you could have
left the loop, like

for obj, name in ((type, '__builtin__.typ'), ...)

So I assumed that you really want as few assertions executed in one
test as possible. I cannot think of any other reason than those two.

BTW your commit &quot;epytext&quot; fixes most but not all. There are still a
few ``xxx`` left. What markup language did you have in mind there?

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Document and isolate test code using the private API of the module to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;be tested.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also unsure about this one.
</I>
Cases like svn r43221

Hoist the use of this private API to a single location in a helper function.

which explains why we need to use the private API.
