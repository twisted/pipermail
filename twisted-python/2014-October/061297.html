Hm.  You're right on two counts.  The lines:

    undecodable = b'\x7f' * 65 + b'\x85'
and

    decodable = b'\x01\x81'

were not related to the change.  I'm not sure why I decided to make 
those changes.  If I were doing it again now, I wouldn't.

But I'll stick by the decision to write `b'remote'` instead of 
`'remote'` on the line:

    vocab = b'remote'
&gt;&gt;<i>My goal is for new code being added to be as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>correct as possible so that it doesn't increase the burden of making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>these fixes later.  The time when the code is being first introduced 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the time when it's easiest to make sure these things are correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I fully agree. Excluding cases where you just re-use an existing string
</I>&gt;<i>in one more place because then you have both 'remote' and b'remote'
</I>&gt;<i>in the source until you change them all (for that you have to grep
</I>&gt;<i>everything anyway). On the other hand, not adapting existing code
</I>&gt;<i>to changed guidelines right when they are changed always generates
</I>&gt;<i>a lot of such inconsistencies, so this one is really peanuts.
</I>&gt;<i>(I know - more manpower is always needed). This is actually a small
</I>&gt;<i>problem for me because I rather copy the style of existing code
</I>&gt;<i>instead of reading boring guidelines.
</I>
I'm glad we're mostly in agreement and I'll take that as a win. :)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;if possible __execute__ (not __define__) only one assert per test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Hmm.  Yes?  I'm not sure.  What do you have in mind here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>svn r43207 Split up the test with multiple assertions into several 
</I>&gt;<i>tests
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There you unfolded the loop. If the real reason was the different
</I>&gt;<i>constructions of the type names (like &quot;__builtin__.type&quot;), I would
</I>&gt;<i>have expected a different commit text, and of course you could have
</I>&gt;<i>left the loop, like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>for obj, name in ((type, '__builtin__.typ'), ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So I assumed that you really want as few assertions executed in one
</I>&gt;<i>test as possible. I cannot think of any other reason than those two.
</I>
Ah.  I understand now, and you divined my intent correctly.
&gt;<i>BTW your commit &quot;epytext&quot; fixes most but not all. There are still a
</I>&gt;<i>few ``xxx`` left. What markup language did you have in mind there?
</I>
sigh... reStructuredText... which Twisted uses for the other half of its 
documentation.
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Document and isolate test code using the private API of the module 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;be tested.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I'm also unsure about this one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Cases like svn r43221
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Hoist the use of this private API to a single location in a helper 
</I>&gt;<i>function.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>which explains why we need to use the private API.
</I>
Ah.  Great.
