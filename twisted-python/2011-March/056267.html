You're absolutely right.  The organization is a total mess.  But here's the surprise: the organization is not new :).  This is the exact same organization that the documentation has had for years.  The difference is that you can see it now, and notice that it's a problem, rather than just search for a document that you want, find that one document outside of the navigation structure, and ignore the rest of the docs (which is what most people do now).  I think that's a very good thing.

For example: both &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.2.0/">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.2.0/</A>&gt; and &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/~glyph/sphinx-preview-11.0pre1/">http://twistedmatrix.com/~glyph/sphinx-preview-11.0pre1/</A>&gt; have a &quot;conch&quot; link.  And as you can see when you follow that link, &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.2.0/conch/">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.2.0/conch/</A>&gt; looks a lot like  &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/~glyph/sphinx-preview-11.0pre1/projects/conch/index.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/~glyph/sphinx-preview-11.0pre1/projects/conch/index.html</A>&gt;.

This issue will be probably be fixed after the migration.  That is, I would certainly be happy if it were fixed before, or at any time really, but fixing it probably requires some tweaks to release infrastructure that would better be put off until we've deleted most of that part of the release infrastructure.  The important point is that it should stop the migration from happening, since the results are actually better now than they were, just more noticeable.

At any rate: thanks for the feedback, it's appreciated!
