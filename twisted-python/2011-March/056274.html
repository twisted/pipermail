Good to know we're not the only ones :)

The fact that it speeds up 'trial twisted' by ~10-15% is a nice bonus too!

A similar scheme has worked well for bzrlib.  +1

&gt;<i> But I'd be happy if this change did _nothing_ but make Failure simply default

</I>
That's fine with me!  I'll update the patch to add captureVars=False to
Failure.__init__ instead of what it currently does, and happily leave defer.py
unmodified from trunk.

Thanks for the feedback,

-Andrew.
