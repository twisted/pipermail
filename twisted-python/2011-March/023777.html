Well, if we take my proposal to not (by default at least) capture the
frames in the first place this isn't an issue is it?  The only other
copy done in Failure is the copy of self.__dict__ in __getstate__, which
is just a shallow copy of one dict, so fairly cheap.

Good point!

&gt;<i> I do wonder if Failure should just be checking Deferred.debug before

Yes, checking Deferred.debug in twisted.python.failure would be bad
layering.  twisted.internet.defer only invokes Failure in a couple of
places, so it's not so onerous to make sure it invokes it to avoid
capturing tracebacks unless it means to.

That said, it might be a good idea to change Failure to *not* capture
tracebacks by default when invoked as Failure().  Perhaps add a
setDebugging toggle to twisted.python.failure too.  If an explicit
traceback is passed to the constructor it would still be captured, and
perhaps provide an alternative constructor for the current &#8220;capture
everything&#8221; behaviour (perhaps via a new optional flag for __init__,
perhaps via a new name DetailedFailure(), perhaps via a classmethod
except failure is not a new-style class and can't be one without
changing to subclass Exception&#8230;) for the rare cases when people want
that.  It's a pity you can't just use Failure(*sys.exc_info()) because
the parameters are in the wrong order.

Certainly the current behaviour of doing a costly capturing of traceback
and frame contents seems like the wrong default, given how rarely I've
seen anyone use Failure.printDetailedTraceback.
