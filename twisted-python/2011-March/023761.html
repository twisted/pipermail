<PRE>Introduction
------------------------
We're looking for proposals on every aspects of Python: programming from novice to advanced levels, applications and frameworks, or how you have been involved in introducing Python into your organisation.

**First-time speakers are especially welcome**; EuroPython is a community conference and we are eager to hear about your experience. If you have friends or colleagues who have something valuable to contribute, twist their arms to tell us about it!

Please also forward this Call for Papers to anyone that you feel may be interested.

Important Deadlines
-------------------
 - April 6th, 2011: End of Call for Presentations.
 - April 11th, 2011: Start of community voting of talks.
 - April 17th, 2011: End of community voting of talks.
 - June 20th, 2011: EuroPython Conference Keynote Day.

The end of the Call for Presentations is approaching. There is now only a little more than 1 week left before we stop accepting new presentation proposals for EuroPython. Don't wait the last minute to formalize a proposal for a presentation!

Presenting at EuroPython
------------------------
We will accept a broad range of presentations, from reports on academic and commercial projects to tutorials and case studies. As long as the presentation is interesting and potentially useful to the Python community, it will be considered for inclusion in the programme.

Can you show the conference-goers something new and useful? Can you show attendees how to: use a module? Explore a Python language feature? Package an application? If so, consider submitting a talk.

Unfortunately, since EuroPython is a not-for-profit community conference, it is not possible to reward speakers (but what price on glory!). However, **speakers will benefit from a reduced conference fee**.

Talks and hands-on trainings
----------------------------
There are two different kind of presentations that you can give as a speaker at EuroPython:

 * **Regular talk**. These are standard &quot;talk with slides&quot;, allocated in slots of 45, 60 or 90 minutes, depending on your preference and scheduling constraints. A Q&amp;A session is held at the end of the talk.
 * **Hands-on training**. These are advanced training sessions for a smaller audience (10-20 people), to dive into the subject with all details. These sessions are 4-hours long, and audience will be strongly encouraged to bring a laptop to experiment. They should be prepared with less slides and more source code. If possible, trainers will also give a short &quot;teaser talk&quot; of 30 minutes the day before the training, to tease delegates into attending the training.

In the talk submission form, we assume that you intend to give a regular talk on the subject, but you will be asked if you are available for also doing a hands-on training on the very same subject.

Speakers that will give a hands-on training are rewarded with a **free entrance** to EuroPython to compensate for the longer preparation required, and might also be eligible for a speaking fee (which we cannot confirm at the moment).

Topics and goals
----------------
Specific topics for EuroPython presentations include, but are not limited to:

- Core Python
- Other implementations: Jython, IronPython, PyPy, and Stackless
- Python libraries and extensions
- Python 3.x migration
- Databases
- Documentation
- GUI Programming
- Game Programming
- Network Programming
- Open Source Python projects
- Packaging Issues
- Programming Tools
- Project Best Practices
- Embedding and Extending
- Science and Math
- Web-based Systems

Presentation goals usually are some of the following:

- Introduce audience to a new topic they are unaware of
- Introduce audience to new developments on a well-known topic
- Show audience real-world usage scenarios for a specific topic (case study)
- Dig into advanced and relatively-unknown details on a topic
- Compare different options in the market on a topic

Inappropriate language and imagery
----------------------------------

EuroPython strongly believes in building a truly diverse community, and fully supports the official Python diversity statement[1]. Given a trail of negative experiences at previous tech conferences, all partecipants will be asked to agree to a code of conduct[2] that explicitly bans verbal and physical harassment at the conference, including talks.

Speakers are thus required to avoid any kind of sexual, racist, or religious language or imagery in the talks, to avoid offending a diverse group that might be under-represented at the conference.

Consider that EuroPython is a conference with a audience from a broad geographical area which spans countries and regions with vastly different cultures. What might be considered a &quot;funny, inoffensive joke&quot; in a region might be really offensive (if not even unlawful) in another. If you want to add humour, references and images to your talk, avoid any choice that might be offensive of a group which is diverse from yours.

Italian Track
-------------
Italy is home to a vibrant Python community that gathers together each year at the local PyCon Italia event (up to 400 delegates!). To acknowledge this reality in EuroPython and to encourage Italian pythoneers who suffer from the language barrier, we will hold an additional Italian track at EuroPython, containg only talks delivered in Italian.

The talk submission form lets you choose the language you want to give the talk in.

If you speak Italian and want to submit a talk for this special track, please go ahead and submit the talk title and abstract directly in Italian. If instead you are available to give the talk twice during EuroPython, in both languages, please make two different submissions for the same talk: one in Italian, and one in English.


Community-based talk voting
---------------------------
This year, for the first time in EuroPython history, the talk voting process is fully public. Every partecipant gains the right to vote for talks submitted during the Call For Papers, as soon as they commit to their presence at the conference by buying a ticket. See all the details in the talk voting[3] page.
