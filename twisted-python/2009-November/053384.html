Do you know roughly how much traffic any of those installations deal 
with?  We do around 50k hits per day, which is basically maxing out our 
hardware.  I have the sense that most trac sites don't handle this much 
traffic.

</I>&gt;<i>Dunno, just trying to find a way to help with my very, very limited

</I>
Several people have spent non-trivial amounts of time looking at this. 
I'm not sure what improvements can be made with only limited additional 
input.

Do you know of any relevant resources which we may have overlooked?  Are 
there guides to running a working trac site?  Tips about special indexes 
to create in the database?  Something?
