Not to be overly blunt, but there are other trac installations running  
on far less capable hardware that don't suck anywhere near as hard.   
That's not to say trac is great, but it isn't near this bad in many,  
many other places.

I don't know anything about the history of this particular  
installation, what else is running on the server etc. but I don't  
think it's trac as trac.  It may be trac as installed in this  
particular situation, with whatever historical mutilations have been  
performed on it, with the particular versions of this and that.

Dunno, just trying to find a way to help with my very, very limited  
time.
