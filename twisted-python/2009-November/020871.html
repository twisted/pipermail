<PRE>Hi,

  I'm interested  in using twisted to build a server for recording streaming
audio.  I've spent some time googling and looking through the archives but
haven't been able to find much in the way of examples for this sort of
usage.  To be clear, I'm not trying to stream media from the server to the
client, but want to stream the audio from (potentially multiple) clients to
the server, where it will be recorded and possibly later annotated for
reference.

  The closest possible example of this sort of usage scenario that I was
able to find was shtoom, but I wasn't able to get very far with that, as the
source does not seem to be available, despite the site still being up
(perhaps I just couldn't find it ).

   Does anyone know of any working examples of such usage that might be
easily adapted.  I'm really only looking for the simplest possible base
example that would allow me to connect one or more clients over localhost
and stream the audio to the server.
   On the other hand, perhaps it is better to just go with the bundled
SocketServer module to start with?

Cheers
