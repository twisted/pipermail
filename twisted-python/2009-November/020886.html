I'm not sure.  That sounds like a lot for trac but I don't really know.

&gt;&gt;<i> Dunno, just trying to find a way to help with my very, very limited

</I>&gt;<i> Several people have spent non-trivial amounts of time looking at this.

I know, and I'm not trying to be flip or anything like it.  I hate to  
ask, but how much memory is in the box?  If it's memory bound with  
that many hits, another couple of gigs could work wonders.  Hell, I'll  
even buy them send them to the hosting company if it comes down to it.

&gt;<i> Do you know of any relevant resources which we may have overlooked?   
</I>&gt;<i> Are
</I>&gt;<i> there guides to running a working trac site?  Tips about special  
</I>&gt;<i> indexes
</I>&gt;<i> to create in the database?  Something?
</I>
Sorry to say, my early experiences with Trac were so bad, I just quit.

Maybe the thing to do is pull together the statistics (is there a  
module for this), and just ask the trac devs for some help.   I'd be  
happy to spearhead that if I could be of some help in that capacity.
