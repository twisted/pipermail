<PRE>Hi,

I need assistance figuring out how to create a push protocol that implements
flow control.

To keep things simple, I'm trying to build a push-based echo server.  It
should
(1) accept incoming tcp connections
(2) on each connection, all data rec'd should be echo'd unchanged.
(3) should the output transport request that transmission be &quot;paused,&quot;
the input transport (in this case, the same socket) should be similarly
blocked.


This would seem to be a simple problem.  I think my &quot;PushEcho&quot; class
should implement both IConsumer and IProducer interfaces; As a consumer,
its dataRecieved method would cause it to act like a producer and call
the transport's dataReceived method.  Similarly, as a producer, it's
pause, and resume methods would be called, and they would (as a
consumer) just call the same functions in the transport.

However, I can't get the plumbing right.

Can someone help by providing pointers or some sample code?

Thanks.
