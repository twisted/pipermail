Hi David,

Thanks for the offer!  Twisted would absolutely benefit from more 
assistance. :)  There are quite a few things that you could do which 
would help out immensely:

  - Ticket reviews, as Glyph mentioned.  Until you get more familiar with 
various parts of Twisted, you probably want to avoid giving a proposed 
change (ie a branch or a patch) a thumbs up - but it's rare that the 
first time a change is submitted for review it's ready for a thumbs up 
anyway, so reviews you can do of tickets to point out what additional 
work is necessary would be super useful.  This lets the contributor get 
on with doing useful work (instead of waiting and waiting for a review) 
and lets people with more Twisted experience focus on things that their 
experience is actually necessary for.

  - Development, either on tickets with the &quot;easy&quot; keyword (at least 
initially), or, even better, on tickets which have already been reviewed 
one or more times and still require some work to be acceptable.  There 
are unfortunately quite a few tickets which have a proposed change which 
has been reviewed but for which the original contributor has 
disappeared.  These are often pretty straightforward to get into 
acceptable shape, so this is a high impact area in which to do work.

  - Triage.  Lots of duplicates are filed in the issue tracker.  Closing 
these as such (with a link to the existing ticket, and another link on 
the existing ticket to the duplicate) makes it that much easier to make 
sense of all the other open tickets (of which there are too many even 
without counting duplicates).

  - Website.  Our front page needs an overhaul.  It's too hard for people 
new to Twisted to get the information they need from the current front 
page.  We should have a goal-oriented page that makes it easy for 
someone who just knows &quot;I want to write a jabber client&quot; to get to the 
Twisted Words page, the jabber/xmpp examples, the Twisted Words 
examples, etc.

If any of these sound interesting to you, dive in!  You might want to 
hop on IRC, #twisted on irc.freenode.net, to talk about things in more 
detail, too.

Jean-Paul
