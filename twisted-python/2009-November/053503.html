Thanks.  It's good to be able to see (at least an early draft of) what 
the outcome of this proposal will be.

I'm glad the reactions have been good so far, but I want to be a wet 
blanket for a moment and suggest that we try to avoid being influenced 
excessively by the &quot;new look&quot; effect.  It would be easy to give the 
existing documentation a face lift without switching systems entirely - 
it's just a matter of editing the template and/or the css.  What are the 
other benefits of the Sphinx output, in particular, the ones which it 
would be difficult to achieve with Lore?

I'll start with one possibility - the index.  Am I right in thinking 
this is automatically generated?  This is something Lore isn't currently 
capable of (there's a branch which addresses this, but I suspect it is 
far too much of a mess to ever merge, so we can ignore it).  Going along 
with this, how much control do we have over how the index is generated? 
Some of what shows up here probably doesn't merit being displayed as 
prominently as this - for example, the historical documents are mostly 
of, well, historical interesting.  What options do we have for changing 
how these are presented?

Jean-Paul
