I'll have to check this from my co-author who did the analysis.

This is good news!

with connected sockets, (almost) the same API calls could be used and 
the details could be possibly abstracted away (some kind of a flag still 
needed to choose between TCP and UDP). A number of applications appear 
to support both TCP and UDP-based connectivity:

4.2.4 A Summary of the Sockets API Findings and Their Implications:

Finding 2 statistics: TCP-UDP hybrids 26.3%

Finding 2. Hybrid applications using both TCP and UDP occur as 
frequently as TCP-only applications. Application developers seem to 
write many application protocols to be run with both transports. While 
it is possible to write almost identical code for the two transports, 
the Sockets API favors different functions for the two. This 
unnecessarily complicates the application code.
