<PRE>Hi Twisters,


Marc-Andre Lemburg from the PSF has been taking care of a Python events
calendar for a while. It now has a twitter feed making it easier to find
new events.

If you're doing any Python-related events, such as of course Twisted
sprints, or maybe Python user group meetups, please don't hesitate to
contact the PSF to get your event added.

M.-A.'s e-mail as been forwarded below.

ANNOUNCING

           Python Events Calendars - Now with Twitter feed

           maintained by the Python Software Foundation (PSF)
                    and a group of volunteers

________________________________________________________________________
INTRODUCTION

As some of you may know, the PSF has put together a team of volunteers
who are maintaining a central Python events calendar. We currently have
two calendars in place:

 * Python Events Calendar - meant for conferences and larger gatherings
   focusing on Python or a related technology (in whole or in part)

 * Python User Group Calendar - meant for user group events and other
   smaller local events

The calendars are displayed on <A HREF="http://pycon.org/">http://pycon.org/</A> and in a smaller
version in the sidebar of the <A HREF="http://python.org/">http://python.org/</A> website.

You can subscribe to the calendars using iCal and RSS feeds and
also embed the calendar widgets on your sites. Please see our wiki
page for details:

    <A HREF="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEventsCalendar">https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEventsCalendar</A>

The calendars are open to the world-wide Python community, so you
can have local user group events, as well as regional and international
conference events added to the calendars.

________________________________________________________________________
NEWS

We have now created a Twitter feed for the calendars, which you can
follow to get updates on all newly added events:

    <A HREF="https://twitter.com/pythonevents">https://twitter.com/pythonevents</A>

The tweets come with links to the event listings, which you can
add to your own Google calendars with a single click.

________________________________________________________________________
ADDING EVENTS

If you want to have entries added to those calendars, please write
to <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">events at python.org</A> and include the following information:

 * Name of the event
 * Type of the event (conference, bar camp, user group, etc)
 * Focus on Python and approximate size
 * URL
 * Location and country
 * Date and time (if relevant)

For recurring events, please also include a description of the
recurrence in a way that's compatible and supported by Google
calendars.

________________________________________________________________________
MORE INFORMATION

More information on the calendars, the URLs, feed links, IDs, embedding,
etc. is available on the wiki:
