That is certainly a fine sentiment with which I agree in principle, but 
an ENORMOUSLY LARGE amount of (really very expensive and business 
critical) software doesn't handle this *at all* as anyone who runs a 
firewall in front of an e-Business app can tell you.

[A well known vendor whose name rhymes with a type of traditional small 
boat used extensively in the British Isles is a particular offender]

So if you're handling this correctly, give yourself a pat on the back - 
there is software costing millions a year in licence fees that assumes 
TCP is as reliable as CPU-&gt;CPU cache communications :o(

&gt;<i> Second, this has nothing whatsoever to do with whether the I/O is

</I>&gt;<i> In fact, this is about the only thing the manhole is used for at

</I>
I'm wondering if TCP keepalive isn't any use to you in this regard?

(and what do Mozilla do with Twisted? :o)
