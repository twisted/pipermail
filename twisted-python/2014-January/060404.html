Hi

A few years ago I ran into the problem of non collectable cycles being 
produced by keeping references around in objects locally.

Please find attached a snippet of code I used over and over again for 
hunting down such cycles. It's for sure not a simple cure, but with a 
manhole service being run in your process of question, it gives you the 
telltale signs your looking for.

Use it like

from dumpObjects import dumpObjects

dumpObjects()

Various include/exclude sets should help you to narrow the search in 
consecutive runs.

As for the lifecycle of deferreds I never ever had a problem with 
deferreds not being cleaned up, it has always been me who produced those 
non collectable cycles, usually under the false assumption, that it was 
safe to keep a ref handy.

Werner
