<PRE>Thanks for the offer to help.

I was hoping someone would see an apparent bug in the outline, so i wouldn't have to build a a SSCCE

unfortunately, that wasn't going to fly, so I built out a self-contained version of the issue 

Before sharing it, I added in some docs references to the example...

and then I noticed something peculiar, and seemed to have solved the problem !  

the issue was this:

1. I used twisted.internet.defer.DeferredSemaphore to set up a semaphore service
2. I queued tasks with `semaphoreService.run( to_thread_function )`
3. `to_thread_function` ran a configurable method through `threads.deferToThread`
4. the configurable method ran something in twisted.enterprise.adbapi.ConnectionPool's `runInteraction`

when copying docs, i realized that I was running `toThread` and then `runInteraction` , which uses it's own thread.  so i had threads spawning threads.

the base 'scaffold' for this daemon has been modified and patched since 2005 , so at some point i made an improvement and left some semi-functional legacy cruft in there.

i'm not sure of the specifics on how / why this manifests, but if I just use runInteraction and bypass using `deferToThread`, everything works out perfect.

if you're curious , i tossed the example online here

	<A HREF="https://github.com/jvanasco/twisted_gist_001">https://github.com/jvanasco/twisted_gist_001</A>

	`constants.py` has some toggles for playing with the return values of the various functions ( controls the base class and subclass )

	it also lets you toggle to use the broken functionality ( thread within a thread ) or what seems to work fine now


happy i seemed to have solved this myself.  still confused why the issue happened , but this fix ( only 1 thread ) seems to be fine and the more ideal approach
