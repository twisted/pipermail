<PRE>Hi everyone,

Since this particular detail was in the middle of Jean-Paul's release announcement, I feel like it's important to draw attention to it.

The new pyOpenSSL v0.14 is a substantial rewrite of all of pyOpenSSL's bindings to OpenSSL: while this rewrite should be a vast improvement, because eliminates lots of error-prone hand-written C code, replacing it with much smaller, much safer declarative C bindings via cffi, it also means that things are different now.

Different means &#8220;possibly broken&#8221; so please test any Twisted applications that use TLS with this pre-release.

Sorry for all the bold text and capital letters, but this is both a big change and also a change to a particularly security-sensitive area of the Twisted stack.  If there were ever a change that you should really test before it's marked as &#8220;final release&#8221;, this is it.
