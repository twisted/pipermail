Andrew&gt; I think the key thing is to remember there are two distinct parts:

Andrew&gt; 1) an operation (which eventually will have a result or failure)
Andrew&gt; 2) a result 
  
Andrew&gt; A Deferred takes care of managing 2.  It's a placeholder for that
Andrew&gt; result, and it can track callbacks that need to be called when it
Andrew&gt; arrives, etc.

Andrew&gt; We currently don't have any formal idioms for 1.  I think this is
Andrew&gt; what you're trying to address.  After all, it's not the result that
Andrew&gt; times out or that you might want to cancel, it's the operation that
Andrew&gt; is expected to generate it.

No, I'm only dealing with 2, not at all with 1. 1 is too complicated and in
a later posting I wrote that I didn't think we should be trying to
interfere with the deferred processing and that cancel is not really a good
name.

Andrew&gt; I don't think it's wise to conflate the two concepts, so I think
Andrew&gt; CancellableDeferred is a poor name.

OK, I think I agree.

Anyway, your mail gave me an idea for how to make the class more
useful. I'll code it, maybe even test it :-), and will post again.
