</I>&gt;<i> Anyways, time for another gripping installment...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Progress:
</I>&gt;<i>   - tables are now handled (mostly) properly, thanks to Zeth at <A HREF="http://commandline.org.uk/">http://commandline.org.uk/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>   - blockquote tags handled
</I>&gt;<i>   - much improved whitespace/indentation handling
</I>&gt;<i>   - some nicer styling thanks to Michael Thompson
</I>&gt;<i>   - I've managed to convert the docs for the 3 Divmod projects with Lore 
</I>&gt;<i>     docs, though I've yet to put them up anywhere.
</I>
Yay!

&gt;<i>   - due to ReST's insistence on &quot;inline markup&quot; being surrounded by 
</I>&gt;<i>     whitespace or certain special characters, there are a lot of places where
</I>&gt;<i>     such inline markup gets jacked up, by not including whitespace in front of 
</I>&gt;<i>     it.  If I put whitespace in front of everything though, my indentation 
</I>&gt;<i>     handling gets jacked up and about 400+ Sphinx build warning result.
</I>&gt;<i>     Not sure if I should spend the time to make whitespace handling really 
</I>&gt;<i>     smart or if these should just be fixed manually post-conversion.
</I>
I don't really understand this problem.  What do you mean about making whitespace handling really smart?  Isn't this the sort of detail that docutils is supposed to handle for you?

&gt;<i>   - Themeing/styling: still mostly a TODO, though new styling looks a lot 
</I>&gt;<i>     better than the default to my eyes.  I'm starting to think that 
</I>&gt;<i>     eventually we might want to have 2 themes/styles...one to match the 
</I>&gt;<i>     trac-based website, and one for bundled docs (docs tarballs, CHM files, etc.)
</I>
That would certainly be nice, but is in no way required for the initial migration.  Still, we should have a workable theme in order before we pull the trigger :).
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - some of the Lore source files have nested &quot;inline markup&quot;, which ReST 
</I>&gt;<i>     disallows.  
</I>
Ugh.  So ReST can't do this?  That's pretty lame.

&gt;<i>       - just handle the outside level of nesting (what I'm doing now) and 
</I>&gt;<i>         fix any problems manually post-conversion.
</I>
I'm assuming there are very few instances of this, so that sounds fine.

&gt;<i>   - xhtml entities are not currently resolved...mostly because it makes 
</I>&gt;<i>     the build take a LOOOONG time.  They can be though.  This shouldn't 
</I>&gt;<i>     be a problem.
</I>
Are you resolving them by downloading all the DTDs or something?

&gt;<i>   - Foolscap 0.5 was released today, which made me wonder what they use for
</I>&gt;<i>     docs...and it's Lore.  I brought this up on IRC, and it was suggested 
</I>&gt;<i>     by many that Lore should stick around even after the conversion according 
</I>&gt;<i>     to the standard Twisted compatibility policy, to give anyone who still 
</I>&gt;<i>     uses it time to migrate.  This sounds like a fine idea to me.  
</I>&gt;<i>     Any thoughts?
</I>
Since nobody really uses lore's API, the same compatibility policy doesn't really apply.  In lore's case, I would say that the policy should be that we include it with X more releases just for packaging convenience, but stop doing maintenance immediately.
