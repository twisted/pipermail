Yes, that's right.  You can return Deferreds from your PB server's methods.  So
long as the eventual result is something serializable over PB (e.g. a
Referenceable or a Copyable), it will work.

&gt;<i>    Google is my friend but I could not find examples of this usage. Is there

Huh, surprisingly not in the primary PB docs.  The Twisted &#8220;finger&#8221; tutorial
does do this, though, if you read it carefully enough.  See finger21.tac in
&lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/tutorial/pb.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/tutorial/pb.html</A>&gt;; the
remote_* methods of PerspectiveFingerFromService delegate to self.service, which
is FingerService, which returns Deferreds from its getUser and getUsers methods.

[...]
&gt;<i>    Is the following code snippet the standard/normal way to defer the return
</I>&gt;<i>    result of a callRemote method call?
</I>
It's a bit odd.  e.g. You do this:

    def remote_shutdown(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot; Instruct Plugin to shutdown &quot;&quot;&quot;
        print &quot;plugin instructed to shutdown&quot;
        d = defer.Deferred()
        self.shutdownHandler(d)
        return d

This can work, so long as on what self.shutdownHandler calls d.callback/errback,
as yours does.  But typically it would be written as:

    def remote_shutdown(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot; Instruct Plugin to shutdown &quot;&quot;&quot;
        print &quot;plugin instructed to shutdown&quot;
        return self.shutdownHandler()

i.e. typically the code that is calling d.callback is also responsible for
creating d.

&gt;<i>    If this is the normal way, how does triggering the deferred on the plugin
</I>&gt;<i>    (client) side also trigger the same/copy deferred returned to the
</I>&gt;<i>    plugin-runner (server)?
</I>&gt;<i>    Is this PB magic, somehow managing deferreds across the PB interface?
</I>
PB doesn't actually send the Deferred over the network, but it does manage the
deferred for you.  It works because when you return a Deferred, PB on the server
will add a callback to it that will send that eventual result over the network,
rather than sending one immediately.

On the client side, as the PB docs point out: &#8220;because of the delay involved
[waiting for a network connection], callRemote() returns a Deferred.&#8221;  (From
&lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/pb-usage.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/pb-usage.html</A>&gt;).

The client doesn't know or care if the server used a Deferred or not, the bytes
on the wire are the same.  (And a delay caused by the server waiting for a
Deferred to fire could just as easily be a delay caused by network congestion.)

I wouldn't describe it as &#8220;magic&#8221; so much as &#8220;a really convenient API&#8221;.
