&gt;<i> I just tracked down a bug in one of our servers that uses twisted PB.
</I>&gt;<i> The long and short of it was that the server made remote calls to

</I>&gt;<i> off the network (disconnected network cable, etc) but the server would

</I>
Right - by default (sans enabling keepalives at the TCP level), TCP
can only detect a problem when it is attempting to transmit data, or
when it receives data from a system that has been restarted.  That's
by design, since it can't tell if the idle time is expected or not.

So if your request to the client makes it through but the connection
breaks before the server needs to send any further data (such as
waiting for a response) the server - waiting to receive - can
essentially remain in that state forever.

Even with keepalives turned on at the TCP level, the total time to
declare a failure with default timers is often in the 2+ hour range.

&gt;<i> Is there some other suitable way to set a timeout on a remoteCall
</I>&gt;<i> when using PB?
</I>
I'd probably suggest implementing some connection monitoring mechanism
in general for each client&lt;-&gt;server connection, rather than trying to
time out individual calls.  The advantage to this is that it covers all
sorts of failures in either direction and let's both sides fail any
pending operations gracefully.

What we did in one of our larger PB systems was have our client
object, after connecting, set up a periodic ping request to the
server.  Failure of that request (in addition to a network failure of
other requestss) would cause the client to disconnect (after
generating an internal signal) and then fall into an automatic
reconnection process.  Since the ping is transmitting data over the
session, failures will be detected much more rapidly (though still not
instantaneously) when the TCP retransmit timers fail to deliver the
data.  We also had separate signaling and reconnect logic that allowed
the client to reattach all of its existing remote object handles if it
reconnected to a server that hadn't restarted (e.g., just a network
outage), but that's more complicated and not suitable for all types
of remote object references.
 
While we didn't have requests originating from the server, you could
have a mirror approach running on the server for each client, or you
could just have a watchdog timer running on the server that
disconnects a client if it hasn't heard a ping request from it in a
given amount of time.

On either side, explicitly disconnecting the connection will also
cause any pending deferreds for PB requests to fail and trigger their
errbacks.

If you really wanted to implement a timeout for a specific request,
you could still use a watchdog timer - start a callLater with the
appropriate timeout, save the response object, and cancel it in the
callback chain for the response once it is received.

What you should do if the callLater does fire is less clear.
Personally I'd probably do something internal so any eventual response
to the pending deferred was ignored.  You probably don't want to
actually fire it yourself, since PB still references it and in theory
could still get a response about it over the stream which would try to
double-fire the deferred.  That's part of why setTimeout on the
deferred itself can be a bad idea - someone else probably also
references that deferred and won't know it has already fired if the
timeout expires.

Disconnecting the client would work, as similar to the above keepalive
approach, it would fire the errback on all pending deferreds over that
session.
