I already lost you at the first sentence.  The class below never appears to use 'self._f', and ... Deferreds are things that fire, I don't see how the callable (f) can fire.  Can you rephrase your intent?

&gt;<i> The reason this is useful is that normally when you call a function that

</I>&gt;<i> If you fire d in this way, then when the original deferred fires (if ever),

</I>
I'm glad you're thinking about this, because it is an *extremely* thorny issue which I would really like to address one day.  Many of the issues you're talking about were brought up, and various solutions suggested, then found problematic, then modified ad nauseam on &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/990">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/990</A>&gt;.  If you can read that discussion and make some sense of it, perhaps you can post a recommendation there, or at least a summary of the discussion so far so that I don't have to read the whole discussion again to remember what I think should happen next? :)

&gt;<i> I don't know why defer.Deferred.setTimeout is deprecated, but I guess it's
</I>&gt;<i> partly to do with this control issue.
</I>
This is one of the reasons, but another major reason is that 'setTimeout' does not belong as a method of Deferred.  If we did support cancellation somehow, the way to set a timeout would be to do 'reactor.callLater(5.0, myDeferred.cancel)'.  Deferred was originally in twisted.python and it really should have remained there, decoupled from twisted.internet.
