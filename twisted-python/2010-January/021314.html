No, I am not.  I probably didn't even notice this style was allowed, and

likely wouldn't have used them even if I noticed.  ('davep' mentioned
on the ticket that he was using named binds, but didn't have an issue
with using cp_arraysize as a keyword in runQuery)

Thanks for trying to help push this along, Tim.  I have no firm opinion
either way.  For me any solution is better than none.  There doesn't
seem
to be any huge objections to using a &quot;cp_arraysize&quot; keyword param in
runQuery, 
so it might not be the purest solution, but does seem practical.
