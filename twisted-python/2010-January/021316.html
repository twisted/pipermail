The thing is, this attitude isn't always reasonable. Deferred is not
necessarily the place to implement cancellation, but I think the idiom
itself is important. Certainly there are some operations where
cancellation is not feasible; perhaps because the underlying APIs do
not support cancellation, or because allowing the operation to
complete is quicker/easier than trying to interrupt it. But, consider
something like the transfer of a 512 TB file; cancellation /is/
possible, through closing the TCP connection, and the operation is
significantly expensive, so &quot;just forget it and let it finish&quot; is a
somewhat cavalier attitude to take.

&gt;<i> &#160;complex manner. Other code, that the Deferred class itself can't possibly
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;be aware of, may be relying on the deferred firing and at least part of
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;its callback chain being run, etc. The simplest thing to do is to just
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;provide a mechanism whereby the eventual holder of the deferred can opt
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;to trigger their deferred immediately and ignore the final result of the
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;original call (supposing there ever is one).
</I>
I would imagine that you would errback the deferred in the general
case of cancellation; if your callback chain doesn't handle errors,
well...
