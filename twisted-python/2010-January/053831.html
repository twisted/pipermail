<PRE>Thanks, I'll keep cx/bb-Freeze in mind if pyinstaller doesn't work out. I
did get some tips from one of our internal guys;  they had built a project
successfully with Twisted &amp; pyinstaller some time back. I'm trying to figure
out the details of what went on there. Seems that they made an &lt;appname&gt;.py
which imported Twisted's UnixApplicationRunner() which then imported what
had been the .tac file (renamed to &lt;appname&gt;tac.py) to launch the server.
Still working out the details, imports, etc., but appears that &lt;appname&gt;.py
took over much of the functionality that twistd was providing and made it
into more of a straightforward python app. We'll see how this goes.

</I>&gt;<i> might be different, but to summarise:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> cx_Freeze put everything into an executable zip file so you are left
</I>&gt;<i> with one main binary and a handful of .so objects for python C modules
</I>&gt;<i> (unless you patch the Python build to build static). I had to switch
</I>&gt;<i> to bbfreeze because I needed to use Nevow and there were too many
</I>&gt;<i> hoops to jump through to make it work with the data files accessed
</I>&gt;<i> relative to __file__.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> bbfreeze works with eggs, so it works with Nevow or anything else that
</I>&gt;<i> uses data files, but the down side is that the result isn't zipped up
</I>&gt;<i> into one executable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm about to reopen the whole freezing thing for a new project, so I
</I>&gt;<i> may be able to report back in a few weeks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm real new to pyinstaller and not really familiar with twisted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; internals, so not sure where to start with this, particularly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whether to package our_server.tac, or the twistd script, or the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; our_server.py as the starting point to bundle all of this stuff
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together. If anyone's done this successfully, or failed miserably,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be interested in getting details.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dropped the tac file to make it easier to specify the entrypoint. To
</I>&gt;<i> do this while still getting all the twistd goodness requires some
</I>&gt;<i> hacking, but it isn't really necessary. You can use the tac file
</I>&gt;<i> (better to change the extension to .py though) and put a few imports
</I>&gt;<i> in the file that are only there to pull in dependencies that the
</I>&gt;<i> freezing program can't find. It's basically an iterative thing - build
</I>&gt;<i> it, note the missing dependencies, import them, repeat.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck.
