It also calls (or at least used to call) stopReading and stopWriting 
immediately after a TCP client connection is made, and then calls 
startReading and startWriting again.. which causes the wrapper to get 
thrown away, so it might miss notifications in the meantime.

I think it already uses weakrefs, but I was never confident that they 
would go away at the right time, and from recent python-dev threads, it 
doesn't sound like it's a good thing to depend on at all any time soon
