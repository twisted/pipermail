I think you are somewhat mistaken, or at least, your message here is 
somewhat misleading. callLater(0) is not special, nor a lie. A reactor 
iteration looks at the current time _once_, and calls all DelayedCalls 
up until that point in time. This means that something like 
&quot;callLater(1, foo); sleep(2)&quot; will *also* not call foo ASAP after the 
function exits (even though its time has passed), but will wait until 
the next reactor iteration.

This is a general rule: no matter what the time value, callLaters() are 
supposed to happen after network I/O has next been processed. It is not 
brokenness, it's just a decision. You need to have *some* scheduling of 
timed events and IO events, and Twisted chose to alternate the two. 
That is a reasonable thing to do, as it helps prevent starvation of IO 
by timed events.

I take it libevent chose to always prefer timed events over network IO.
