  Yep.

  Hopefully you already have something like this:

    from twisted.protocols import basic

    class SimpleRequestProtocol(basic.LineReciever):
        def connectionMade(self):
            self.outstanding = {}
            self.counter = 0

        def request(self, query):
            d = self.outstanding[self.counter] = defer.Deferred()
            self.sendLine('%d %s' % (self.counter, query))
            self.counter += 1
            return d

        def lineReceived(self, response):
            tag, rest = response.split(None, 1)
            self.outstanding.pop(int(tag)).callback(rest)

  Letting the XML-RPC side just call `request' and get back a Deferred that fires whenever the response arrives.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And finally I don't want to use callLater if I can avoid it. I'd like 
</I>&gt;<i> the performance to be as high as possible. That is, the XMLRPC reply 
</I>&gt;<i> should be sent as soon as the LineReceiver has gotten the reply.
</I>&gt;<i> I also don't want to setup and tear down a connection on the 
</I>&gt;<i> LineReceiver side for every request that comes in on the XMLRPC side. 
</I>&gt;<i> There is one server on the LineReceiver side that gets all the 
</I>&gt;<i> questions, so I liked to be able to have one connection going.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
  So, first, you want to be able to get a connected instance:

    from twisted.internet import reactor, protocol

    def getConnectedProto(host, port):
        f = protocol.ClientCreator(reactor, SimpleRequestProtocol)
        return f.connectTCP(host, port)

  This returns a Deferred that fires with the instance once the connection is made.  You can call it from your XML-RPC code, add a callback to the result, and in the callback invoke .request() with whatever args is appropriate.

  But you also don't want a connection per request.  So you want to cache the connection:

    from twisted.internet import defer

    class ConnCache:
        def __init__(self):
            self._cache = {}

        def getConnectedProto(self, host, port)
            try:
                return defer.succeed(self._cache[host, port])
            except KeyError:
                d = self._makeConn(host, port)
                d.addCallback(self._cacheConn, host, port)
                return d

        def _makeConn(self, host, port):
            f = protocol.ClientCreator(reactor, SimpleRequestProtocol)
            return f.connectTCP(host, port)

        def _cacheConn(self, protoInstance, host, port):
            self._cache[host, port] = protoInstance
            return protoInstance

  So from your XML-RPC server, you can instantiate ConnCache and store the instance.  When you need to do something with your SimpleRequestProtocol, you can just call .getConnectedProto() on it.  If there's a connection, it'll be quick; if there's not, it'll go make one and save it for next time, too.

  Hope this helps,

  Jp
