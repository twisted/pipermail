I'm not going to do any web sort of thing, I'm using ssl only to wrap
encryption around a stocket. It looked the fastest way. the protocol
running on top of ssl is a not standard one. This is why I posted here
and not to twisted-web (I'm not even subscribed there).

this doesn't look possible, the server side that should emit the
graceful webpage is a malicious attack that would rather show you the
true faked website instead of a warning.

Only the client can notice the error and the graceful message I was
going to add was infact in the client (as soon as I notice the server is
the wrong one and it doesn't match the client certificate stored on the
client harddisk, I will immediatly stop talking with the server).

&gt;<i>   drawback of this approach is that it allows attackers to charge you
</I>&gt;<i>   the cost of a full SSL handshake and a bit of encrypted traffic.
</I>&gt;<i>   The advantages seem to far outweigh this.
</I>
full ssl handshake during an attack is fine ;).

&gt;<i>   A further problem with the OpenSSL verify callback is that it is
</I>&gt;<i>   synchronous and called in the IO thread.  For any non-trivial
</I>&gt;<i>   application, this is likely to end up blocking the reactor in

</I>
good point. luckily this is not a problem at all for my case, since it's
only invoked in the client and when the client startup, it won't be
asynchronous anyways, since python also need to read the *.py sources from disk ;)

the server truly needs to be always async, and the server won't use the
verify callback (that can only be useful in the client).

Anyways I'm all hears if you've a better solution to do the verify. I
don't claim my solution to be good, but this was the only way I could
make it work so far (and it's pretty much undocumented, that's why I
said it may be appropriate to put more focus on the verification of the
certificate as a more official API in twisted, because without any
verification the ssl protocol is weak).

Please let me know if I should subscribe to twisted-web or if it's ok to
discuss the strict SSL issues here.

thanks for the help!
