  You may want to add Qt to the list of broken reactors.  Quite some time ago, it had a place on the reactors buildslave.  Due to gross breakage and a complete absence of interest in fixing it, it was removed.

  Since it is lacking a maintainer, I think it makes for a good candidate for some kind of deprecation in 2.0, for removal in a later release if no one steps up to maintain it.

  A similar case can probably be made for the other three reactors you mentioned: if no one plans to get them working, there's little point in keeping them around.  I think the picture is somewhat better for IOCP and cf: their authors are still around, here and there, and there is actually a benefit to using them ;)  I hope they can be fixed instead of removed.  Wx is tough.  It will be difficult to fix, and lacks a maintainer.  On the other hand, wxWidgets and wxPython _should_ be getting much better in the medium-term future, and it's possible that the current difficults preventing wxreactor from working well will go away.  In this case, the minimal effort on our part to update to new APIs (or whatever) is probably worth it, as wx is fairly popular.  Of course, this does nothing to help the state it is in currently...
