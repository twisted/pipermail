Hello.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm new to Twisted and I have tried to read and understand the intricate  
</I>&gt;<i> sides of it.
</I>&gt;<i> And have found as so many other that the learning curve pretty steep,  
</I>&gt;<i> especially I guess if one comes from being a C programmer :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, this is my problem:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm building a system that consists of a number of nodes, each node  
</I>&gt;<i> acting as a receiver and transmitter of messages. The protocol used  
</I>&gt;<i> between the nodes might be a message passing system like xmpp or  
</I>&gt;<i> something else. The number of nodes are dynamic and might change at any  
</I>&gt;<i> time. Plus there is no way by which you can know when the system is  
</I>&gt;<i> started how many nodes there will be. Also nodes might receive messages  
</I>&gt;<i> from any number of nodes and be expected to transmit the messages to  
</I>&gt;<i> several nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Writing the 'server' part of a node is easy, plenty of examples of that  
</I>&gt;<i> exists on the net.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Writing the 'client' side is not so easy and here I guess my C legacy is  
</I>&gt;<i> hampering me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I'd like someone to give me, or point me, to an example on how to  
</I>&gt;<i> dynamically create new connections to receivers.
</I>
I don't see the need for anything special. The reactor.connectTCP function
is probably what you want.

&gt;<i> I first though these connections should be shortlived that is 'open the  
</I>&gt;<i> connection, send the message, receive the ACK and close the connection'  
</I>&gt;<i> but now I think it might be wiser to keep the connections as long as  
</I>&gt;<i> possible. That is, until that receiver disappears.
</I>
Just call transport.loseConnection() when you want it to go away.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another side of this is that the influx of messages might be higher than  
</I>&gt;<i> the possible output, that is each node has to keep queues for messages  
</I>&gt;<i> not yet sent and messages sent but not ack'ed.
</I>&gt;<i> It might also happen that recivers of messages are not accessible in  
</I>&gt;<i> which case the message has to be queue until the receiver pops up again.  
</I>&gt;<i> The system is not allowed to drop messages.
</I>&gt;<i> Note, that each incomming message might have several receivers, so one  
</I>&gt;<i> incomming message might end up in the sendqueue of several receivers.
</I>
...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And here in lies one of the problems, I guess I have to keep a  
</I>&gt;<i> 'centrally' managed queue, that should then be notified on the change of  
</I>&gt;<i> status of a message on route to a recevier. How should I implement this ?
</I>
*shrug*, depends on the application. Do you want central management?
Do you really need it?


You really need to ask some more specific questions before anyone can give
you good answers.
