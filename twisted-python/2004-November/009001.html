  There's already a bug in the tracker, and I added some code along these lines yesterday.

  However, after some discussion with James Knight, I don't think the set_verify OpenSSL API is of any relevance to this use case.  Andrea would probably be better off verifying the client certificate at a later time.  The discussion of exactly where really belongs on the twisted-web mailing list, but as far as the SSL details are concerned, rejecting the certificate at the handshake verification time causes the handshake to fail; while it is possible that this is a non-fatal error, many implementations will simply drop the connection anyway.

  When performing an application-level certificate verification subsequently, a secure communication channel has been established and can be used to communicate the error to the user as, say, a web page informing them of the invalidity of their certificate.  The drawback of this approach is that it allows attackers to charge you the cost of a full SSL handshake and a bit of encrypted traffic.  The advantages seem to far outweigh this.

  A further problem with the OpenSSL verify callback is that it is synchronous and called in the IO thread.  For any non-trivial application, this is likely to end up blocking the reactor in unacceptable ways.
