That's an interesting point.
I don't really need CSS to do the work, I can do it right there in the
HTML...I'm just kinda wondering whether it is the right thing to do...

&gt;<i> As far as EPS conversion, I've already done the legwork on this one if

Well, I'm more wondering what interface it should present to the user --
once we decide on an interface, the implementation shouldn't be hard.
I'm currently leaning towards &lt;a href=&quot;file.eps&quot; class=&quot;eps&quot;&gt;caption&lt;/a&gt;.
The rationale is that this seems to be the best bet in case your browser
happens to have a handler for the PS format, which is a gazillion times
more likely than &lt;img src=&quot;file.eps&quot;/&gt; working. Again, the overriding
concern here is &quot;what looks good in the source format&quot;.

Overall, I think that the conclusion I've drawn from this useful discussion
is: &quot;people would kill for navigation&quot;. I've got some thoughts on this
subject: this is certainly a thorny issue. 

Thanks for the ideas,
Moshe Zadka

Buffy: I don't like you hanging out with someone that... short.
Riley: Yeah, a lot of young people nowadays are experimenting with shortness.
