That's an interesting point.
I don't really need CSS to do the work, I can do it right there in the
HTML...I'm just kinda wondering whether it is the right thing to do...

Well, I'm more wondering what interface it should present to the user --
once we decide on an interface, the implementation shouldn't be hard.
I'm currently leaning towards &lt;a href=&quot;file.eps&quot; class=&quot;eps&quot;&gt;caption&lt;/a&gt;.
The rationale is that this seems to be the best bet in case your browser
happens to have a handler for the PS format, which is a gazillion times
more likely than &lt;img src=&quot;file.eps&quot;/&gt; working. Again, the overriding
concern here is &quot;what looks good in the source format&quot;.

Overall, I think that the conclusion I've drawn from this useful discussion
is: &quot;people would kill for navigation&quot;. I've got some thoughts on this
subject: this is certainly a thorny issue. 

Thanks for the ideas,
Moshe Zadka

Buffy: I don't like you hanging out with someone that... short.
Riley: Yeah, a lot of young people nowadays are experimenting with shortness.
