<PRE>Thanks Jp, this is helpful.

The files that I need to serve up are quite big (some are a meg or more),
and it would be bad to block other resources while the file loads into
memory via file.read() or for the time it takes for the client to 
completely consume the file.

Ok.  So this would be the equivalent of a &quot;file generator&quot; which
returns its content in say 4K chunks?  This would work by returning
a callback which (a) wrote out 4K and then (b) deferred itself again?

class deferredreader:
    def __init__(self,filename,chunksize = 4096):
        self.filename  = filename
        self.file      = None
        self.chunksize = 4096
    def callback(self,req):
        if not self.file:
            self.file = open(filename,&quot;r&quot;)
            return DEFERRED
        chunk = self.file.read(self.chunksize)
        if chunk: 
            req.write(chunk) 
            return DEFERRED
        else:
            return &quot;&quot;

(written but not tested)

Is this the Jist of it?  It still has the problem that file.read 
is a blocking call; I suppose for unix platforms you could use
&quot;poll()&quot; to not block.  This is probably resonable; on the server
side you don't block, while for desktop windows clients it blocks.

Is this what you were thinking with the chain of deferreds?

Best,

Clark
