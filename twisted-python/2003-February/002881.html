</I>
I agree that comprehending the &quot;basic concepts of Reactor, Factory, Protocol
and Transport&quot; is not too much to ask of a Twisted newbie, so long as you
don't unnecessarily distract them :)

Anyway, I've taken a look at the current shape of the docs, and I've got
a couple of ideas:

  - The &quot;The Basics&quot; chapter covers too little too thinly to be of any use.
    Its pages should be moved accordingly:
      - Installation -&gt; Introduction
      - Bringing up a web server -&gt; Web Applications
      - Using the utilities, Using manhole to configure twisted, Using
        telnet to configure twisted -&gt; a new chapter &quot;Administering Twisted
        Applications&quot;, or something like that.  The new chapter would be
        placed somewhere after Low-Level Twisted.
  - Removing the &quot;The Basics&quot; chapter would move the High-Level Twisted to
    the second chapter, right after Introduction.  This feels right to me :)

Currently, &quot;The Basics&quot; chapter offers *nothing* relevant to a newbie
Twisted developer.
  
&gt;<i> Outside of the set of things you've talked about here, Twisted also contains
</I>&gt;<i> servers for HTTP, NNTP, FTP, IRC, [...], and a plethora of application-domain
</I>&gt;<i> abstractions to support those protocols.  Putting more than one of _those_ into
</I>&gt;<i> a general introductory document because you think it's cool is probably
</I>&gt;<i> overkill, although it's hard to avoid completely.
</I>
Definitely.  Ideally, there would be a &quot;Twisted Protocols&quot; chapter in the
docs, with a section for each module in twisted.protocols.* -- but most of
those modules are moving targets, and the API docs aren't too bad, so it's
not a big priority.  Perhaps a limited &quot;Brief Guide to Twisted Protocols&quot;
which just covers a couple of the major modules would be beneficial, though?

&gt;<i> However, TAPs are one of the few base mechanisms for services to communicate
</I>&gt;<i> with each other within the Twistedverse.  Much like Deferreds, they don't imply
</I>&gt;<i> any particular functionality of your application beyond &quot;asynchronous
</I>&gt;<i> execution&quot;.  They do have the additional overhead of &quot;persistence&quot;, but you
</I>&gt;<i> don't need to worry much about that.  If you're not instantiating any
</I>&gt;<i> particularly weird objects of your own, the framework won't burden you with
</I>&gt;<i> unpersistable stuff at least for the initial TAP construction.
</I>
They're orthongal to the task of writing a server/client using Twisted, thus
they shouldn't be up there with Factories, Protocols and Deferreds in the
set of Stuff A New Twisted Developer Needs To Know.

I do agree that TAPs are something a medium-level Twisted programmer should
know, I just disagree with making them a focus of the introductory docs.

&gt;<i> &gt; I'll even go so far as speculating that this will cause more external
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; projects to use TAPs, because they won't be seen as some annoying idea in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; beginner docs that they had to skip past to get real work done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Based on my experience thus far, I doubt this very much.  I'd be interested in
</I>&gt;<i> a simple show of hands that indicates whether this is an accurate perception.
</I>
Me too; after all, it's mere speculation on my part :)

&gt;<i> Most people, including software developers, will skip anything they don't
</I>&gt;<i> already believe they need to read.  Server software developers don't think very
</I>&gt;<i> much about integration: though someone using Twisted has eschewed custom and
</I>&gt;<i> decided not to rewrite everything from scratch, there is still a persistent
</I>&gt;<i> belief in the application developers have an unrealistic degree of control over
</I>&gt;<i> the deployment environment, which turns software immediately into
</I>&gt;<i> consultingware and ruins its general applicability.  TAPs are one tiny, tiny
</I>&gt;<i> microcosm of this problem, so I don't expect that they will solve all the
</I>&gt;<i> world's ills in this regard, either :).
</I>
Especially considering they don't yet do WinNT services, for instance :)

I also think that TAPs aren't particularly good for, say, a GTK IRC client.
It makes much more sense for a user to run &quot;/usr/bin/twisted-chat&quot;, than
&quot;mktap twisted-chat; twistd -f twisted-chat.tap&quot;.  So I'm not convinced that
they're as universally applicable as Factories, etc, which is why I think
they should be less prominent.

I also think that this sentence from plugin.html is worded too strongly
(especially given that it's in &lt;strong&gt; tags):
    &quot;Although there are other ways for Twisted to call your code, all
    Twisted projects should start as a plug-in of some kind.&quot;

Twisted is quite capable of being useful standalone apps like GUI IRC
clients, but nothing in that doc suggests to me that writing one as a
Twisted plugin would be a good idea.  Perhaps what I'm really trying to say
is that not all the world is a long-running unix daemon with interesting
persistable state, but currently the docs assume that.

&gt;<i> Featuring the TAP plugin howto prominently at least stimulates debate about
</I>&gt;<i> TAPs.  
</I>
Couldn't you just post to the mailing list like a normal person? ;)

&gt;<i>        This conversation is not the first such one (though it is by far the
</I>&gt;<i> lengthiest and most public). Conversations stimulate development in turn.
</I>
Indeed! :)

&gt;<i> Despite occasional fits of philosophical obscurantism, I am also more a
</I>&gt;<i> programmer than an ideologue.  While this conversation has been going on, I've
</I>&gt;<i> been kicking around more and more ideas for COIL and how to make this whole
</I>&gt;<i> plugin thing a really slick whiz-bang experience.  I'm sure that will be more
</I>&gt;<i> convincing than an email thread.
</I>
Yes!

&gt;<i> Those of you who are disagreeing, consider that even your disagreement is a
</I>&gt;<i> contribution :-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Give Twisted plugins its own, comprehensive doc that can assume knowledge of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; basic Twisted, rather than short-changing it by making it the introductory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doc.  It could start with a section titled &quot;Motivation&quot;, explaining the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; advantages of twistd and mktap.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While I think of this as an important introductory doc, it's already the 18th
</I>&gt;<i> document in the book.  In fact, it comes after &quot;Using Dirdbm&quot;, which I think
</I>&gt;<i> may be shortchanging it a *bit* more than treating it as introductory :-).
</I>
I must admit, I recalled it being more prominent than that... being dumped
after Using Dirdbm is a bit harsh :)

&gt;<i> As to comprehensiveness: I'd love to have a whole chapter on plugins, but
</I>&gt;<i> frankly there isn't that much to cover.  Do you feel that the current doc is
</I>&gt;<i> not thorough enough?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And finally, motivation: the section &quot;Twisted and You: Where Does Your Code Fit
</I>&gt;<i> In?&quot; may not be optimal, but I think it explains in overview terms why one
</I>&gt;<i> would want to use a TAP.
</I>
You're probably right... the existing docs for plugins are fairly good.  The
main part lacking is something that points out &quot;Hey, if you do this, you can
use twistd(1), and take advantage of its daemonisation and logging and
etc...&quot;.  It's hard to see the immediate benefit of mktap and twistd, when
you could ignore them and just run &quot;./foo ...&quot;, rather than &quot;mktap foo ... ;
twistd -f foo&quot;.

So, I'm asking for a more pragmatic motivation, rather than the existing
(but still valuable) philosophical one, which doesn't point this out.
&quot;Framework&quot; vs. &quot;library&quot;?  Who cares.  &quot;Yet another abstraction I have to
cope with&quot;?  Bleagh.  &quot;It will give me proper daemonisation and logging and
...&quot;?  Hey, tell me more!

-Andrew.
