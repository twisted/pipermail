</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Frankly, I see TAPs as one more concept that a new user shouldn't be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't try make people swallow all of Twisted at once... it's just too

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll even go so far as speculating that this will cause more external

</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> the beginner docs that they had to skip past to get real work done.  
</I>&gt;<i> Give
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted plugins its own, comprehensive doc that can assume knowledge of

</I>&gt;<i> introductory
</I>&gt;<i> doc.  It could start with a section titled &quot;Motivation&quot;, explaining the
</I>&gt;<i> advantages of twistd and mktap.
</I>
I think I agree with you.  As I see it, TAPs are not particularly 
useful for developers *until* they're ready to distribute their 
applications.  Maybe they should be relegated to a section of the HOWTO 
on &quot;How to distribute your Twisted application&quot; or &quot;How to run your 
Twisted application as a daemon&quot;?

I think something to help this along would be to port twistd/taps to 
win32, and allow it to become a Windows NT service?  It wouldn't be too 
hard.
