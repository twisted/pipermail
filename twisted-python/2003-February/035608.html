Done.

Right, and I agree with you that the creation of the rfc-822-format
is not part of send(E)mail's job (which is why I wrote the sendmail
function in the first place). So I've added a deprecation warning
stating that you should consider changing your code to using the
email module and sendmail()

&gt;<i>As long as it's still maintained, though, the existing code should 
</I>&gt;<i>remain in place rather than dragging a new dependency in for use with 
</I>&gt;<i>2.1 (since 'email' is only in the stdlib since 2.2)
</I>
It's not much code (right now anyway, but it seems to be growing) so
it shouldn't be hard to keep it up to snuff in it's current state.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3. What's up with the SMTP logger?  and logging every line in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> client?  This is duplicated generic code, and should probably be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> refactored into someplace more appropriate, like twisted.python.log.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ). My first look at t.p.log suggested not using it, since it dealt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mostly with syslog()-like logging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You're right.  Given this use-case though, it sounds like you need 
</I>&gt;<i>little more beyond cStringIO...?
</I>
Well, I wanted to be able to limit the size of it, but apart from that
cStringIO would've done the job.

&gt;<i>t.p.log might not be the best place to put it, come to think of it, 
</I>&gt;<i>since your impression of 'something like syslog' is correct.  But 
</I>&gt;<i>somewhere in t.p in general.
</I>
I made it t.py.linelog. Feel free to change the name if you come
up with something better.
