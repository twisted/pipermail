Yes, by the &quot;framework&quot;, I really meant twisted.internet.  The rest of
Twisted is largely just pre-built utilities for twisted.internet, to save
you the work of e.g. writing your own web server :)

So, to be clear: when I was talking about Twisted in the previous mail, I
was really only referring to &quot;core&quot; Twisted, i.e. twisted.internet.

&gt;<i> Also, I should note the package layout: twisted.internet is the very
</I>&gt;<i> basic stuff that your Twisted app will never be
</I>&gt;<i> without. twisted.python has a lot of utilities that twisted.internet
</I>&gt;<i> and other packages use. twisted.protocols gives you all the basic
</I>&gt;<i> protocol support. These three packages are the most fundamental to
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted. The rest are mainly application-level packages.
</I>
Which reminds me; we probably need to document this more up-front.  If a
newbie can realise that &quot;only&quot; twisted.{internet,protocols,python} is what
they need to get started, and the rest of Twisted is effectively just
libraries using that framework, then it (hopefully) makes learning it all
much easier.

&gt;<i> In addition to these, though, it sounds like Rob will also want to use
</I>&gt;<i> twisted.spread (and twisted.cred) for his application. Most of the
</I>&gt;<i> rest is unneeded.
</I>
Except that every network server evolves to the point where it is also a web
server ;)

-Andrew.
