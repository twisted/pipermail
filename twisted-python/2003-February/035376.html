I may be missing your point, but I don't find TAPs &quot;unuseful&quot;, 
even though I haven't yet begun to distribute my application.  
As I said, one of the first things I did was write a 
tap creation script, pgertap.py, for my application, and it 
helped me organize my thoughts on planning config options, 
how various modules should start up in the server, etc.  Once 
in a while I'll refactor something and have to make a little 
adjustment in pgertap.py, but that's almost a useful thing 
in itself, in that pgertap.py contains a very brief synopsis 
of the architecture.  

When I make a change to the server and want to try it out, 
all I have to do is, in my &quot;tap building&quot; directory:

kill `cat twistd.pid`
rm * (remove the old taps and log file)
  [in a root shell, run setup.py in PanGalactic dir to reinstall]
mktap pger
twistd -f pger.tap

Doesn't get much easier than that.  Kind of gives a warm and 
fuzzy to know the install/mktap/run process works each 
time, anyway.  

As a relatively naive user of twisted, I only have a superficial, 
mechanical understanding of taps, but that doesn't bother me ... 
the simple little tap incantations make the twisted magic seem 
friendly somehow.  

Cheers,
-- Steve.
