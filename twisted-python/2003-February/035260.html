&gt;<i> Perhaps I don't understand YOUR Twisted model of networking, which is

</I>&gt;<i> model.
</I>What to hell does OSI have to do with Turing-machines?
Nothing, or less?
&gt;<i> Perhaps YOU need to learn about the various layers of the model before
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> begin to bandy about the operationally defined words transport and
</I>&gt;<i> protocol.
</I>Well, there are not to many &quot;sucessful&quot; applications of OSI in the real world. 
TCP/IP comes to mind as a prime example.

&gt;<i> Clearly, the folks at Twisted have their own meanings for transport and
</I>&gt;<i> protocol, which differ greatly from their KNOWN and ACCEPTED definitions
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> employed in the PROFESSIONAL programming world and the ACADEMIC
</I>&gt;<i> programming
</I>&gt;<i> world.
</I>Not really. My experience suggests that terms that are as heavy overloaded 
always need a definition in the context they are used.

One of the telltales of a professional is that he can adjust to very different 
kinds of environments quickly.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Incidentally, I was writing network-based applications when you were
</I>&gt;<i> still
</I>&gt;<i> in grade school.
</I>Who cares? Especially in the IT world being an old-hand is not necessarily a 
good thing. 
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be sure to recommend to my Fortune 500 clients to not use a product
</I>&gt;<i> administered by essentially, immature children.
</I>Who is the immature child here?
Coming into a community, barking around acrynoms that nobody cares about, 
insulting the developers, and so on?
If you think that renaming all the stuff is a good idea, you are certainly 
invited to do it yourself.

Last time I checked you are quite allowed to fork of a OSI-Twisted project.
In effect if you care that much about OSI terminology, you are quite capable 
to patch it yourself. :)

Well, that's curious if you list Twisted on the first line of your Resume, and 
then you do not recommend it. (Well at least in situations where Twisted 
makes sense.)
