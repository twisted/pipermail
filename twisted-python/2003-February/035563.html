</I>
No, it's even worse than that: DB API 2.0 doesn't specify which paramstyle
to use, it merely states that possible values are &quot;qmark&quot;, &quot;numeric&quot;,
&quot;named&quot;, &quot;format&quot;, and &quot;pyformat&quot;.  So a DB API 2.0-compliant module is free
to implement any of these it feels like, so long as it sets the correct
paramstyle for it.  Thus they've defined a spec which allows 5 incompatible
flavours.  As far as I can see, the only portable way to write queries is to
format the queries yourself, which means handling correct quoting yourself.
Yuck.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Is this a problem with pyPgSQL? something else? pyPgSQL is the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah, that is a good point.  The howto should probably use examples that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work with pyPgSQL, to save confusion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> or at least distinguish.  I assumed that the howto was using proper DB
</I>&gt;<i> API syntax, and that pyPgSQL is not 100% compliant, but it would be nice
</I>&gt;<i> to see the line drawn.  I don't know that I've worked with a fully DB
</I>&gt;<i> API compliant driver at this point ;p
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the clarification...
</I>
The howto is using proper DB API syntax.  The problem is that being DB API
2.0 compliant doesn't help here; qmarks format strings are compliant -- but
incompatible with pyformat format strings, which are also compliant.
Twisted has nothing to do with this mess, and lets you and your db module
sort it out between yourselves :)
