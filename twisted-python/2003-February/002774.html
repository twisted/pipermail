<PRE>Dear Twisted Users and Developers,

I have refactored Lore to get rid of some of the ugliness that it has
managed to accumulate. It used to be that there were three Lore scripts:
generatelore, html2latex and hlint. The second two were misnamed, and only
the first one had nice progress bars. In addition, the man2lore capability
was not available via a command line script. It was amazingly hard to
extend Lore, so much that it drove several users to maintain their own
fork.

Hopefully, all of these problems are solved after the refactoring. Documentation
is available at doc/howto/lore.html and the Lore manpage. Extending is
currently not documented, but twisted/lore/math.py is an example for how
I believe extensions should go. There are many more features planned, but
hopefully there will be no more UI breakage.

Moshe

Buffy: I don't like you hanging out with someone that... short.
Riley: Yeah, a lot of young people nowadays are experimenting with shortness.
