I'm glad that you found some of these things easy to do.  I also wouldn't argue
that the existing documentation _is_ necessarily sufficient for those use-cases
that you've provided.  However, have you actually looked at all of it yet?  It
does sort of make your feedback less useful to begin with &quot;I began by ignoring
[large portions of documentation] ...&quot; and end with &quot;the documentation was not
sufficient ...&quot;.

In particular, have you checked out
<A HREF="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/pb-cred">http://www.twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/pb-cred</A> ? The title does not have
the word &quot;cred&quot; in the HTML index, so perhaps you overlooked it?  If so, what's
missing?

&gt;<i> right now we are using twisted for two &quot;work&quot; projects and we plan to
</I>&gt;<i> integrate in it a port of our previous product (easy, transactional db
</I>&gt;<i> access on server side and automatic binding of objects to the gui client
</I>&gt;<i> side, more on that if you people are interested.)
</I>
When can you be more specific? :)

&gt;<i> maybe i am a little biased by the fact that our previous framework was
</I>&gt;<i> very similar to PB, but i don't think people approaching twisted are
</I>&gt;<i> interested in yet another http/irc/xxx server (w/ or w/o TAPS.)
</I>&gt;<i> more on the &quot;framework&quot; side, to develop applications or custom
</I>&gt;<i> protocols. 
</I>
I wish you were right!  This was not a technology space I really wanted to
address, originally.  Unfortunately, &quot;web&quot; is still hot these days, and Twisted
adds some substantial frosting to the web that just isn't possible with most
other servers.  Most (I would go so far as to say &quot;almost all&quot;) of the initial
burst of interest in Twisted happened when I added a web-server, even when the
webserver was crap.  The enigmatic &quot;tenth&quot; put it best in the quotefile:

    &lt;tenth&gt; I get the feeling that I could rack up some ad impressions by
    posting an announcement to [freshmeat] about a webserver &quot;powered entirely
    by love, that I made out of this bong I had&quot;.
    &lt;tenth&gt; Well, as long as it did something really l88t that other
    bong-servers didn't do, anyway.

Twisted is not powered entirely by love, so to set the record straight: it is
powered by a glowing green substance that fell to earth, presumably from space.
Do not apply Twisted to your skin or eyes.  Do not taunt &quot;happy fun internet&quot;.
For use only as directed.
