</I>&gt;<i> on your own there.
</I>

Hi Phil,
Thanks for the reply.  My implementation is very similar to what you
described below.  I am having the clients pass in a 'mind' object that's
representative of them, which is good enough to keep track of some
information.  What I am having trouble with is getting access to the clients
IP address.  This is not something I can pass in in the PBClientFactory's
login method, since many computers are NAT'ed.

&gt;<i> class MyRealm:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Holds a reference to the main service object.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     __implements__ = portal.IRealm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     def __init__(self, service):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Create a realm with the given service.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         self.service = service
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     def requestAvatar(self, avatarId, mind, *interfaces):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         This function is called after the user has verified their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         identity. It returns an object that represents the user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         in the system, i.e., an avatar.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         if pb.IPerspective in interfaces:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             avatar = self._getPBAvatar(avatarId, mind)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             ####################### &lt;-- RIGHT HERE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             return pb.IPerspective, avatar, avatar.logout
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         else:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;             raise NotImplementedError(&quot;no interface&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is where you want to maintain your client list. The hardest part
</I>&gt;<i> is deciding on a place to put it that will be accessible from all
</I>&gt;<i> your code; I usually use a singleton pattern of some kind, where I
</I>&gt;<i> can import a module that holds onto client references and provides
</I>&gt;<i> functions to manipulate/retrieve that list.
</I>

Yes, this is something I do have trouble with.  I will look into the
singleton pattern.  It would be nicer if there was a convenient way to
bubble up the  list of clients.

So, that point where I put all those hashes is a pretty good place to
&gt;<i> add clients your client queue. The 'mind' argument is usually a
</I>&gt;<i> reference to the client on the other end, assuming your client passes
</I>&gt;<i> it properly. My client does this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     # self.client is a Referenceable on the client side.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     defer = self.factory.login(credentials.UsernamePassword
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (username, password), self.client)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     defer.addCallback(connected_callback, self)
</I>

I do the same thing.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's a lot of flexibility there. You could move the
</I>&gt;<i> clienttracker.append call right inside your Avatar constructor -- the
</I>&gt;<i> only reason I didn't is because my server supports a number of
</I>&gt;<i> protocols besides PB, and I wanted to deal with them universally.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing this approach doesn't do is keep track of clients that
</I>&gt;<i> connect, but fail authentication. To do that, you'd need to subclass
</I>&gt;<i> Broker, but that's a tough one. I looked into this once before, and
</I>&gt;<i> it certainly appears doable -- in the end, a Broker is still a
</I>&gt;<i> Protocol, which means it has a transport property you can get client
</I>&gt;<i> addresses out of.
</I>

This is exactly what I need to do so I can associate a client with both
their username and ip address.  I have access to the broker if I subclass
PBServerFactory, but I am not sure how to access it from the Realm, or if it
is possible at all.

Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Thanks,
Yi
