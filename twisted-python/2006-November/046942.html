</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;I was wondering if twistd/the application class could have a &quot;exit on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;Exception&quot; for this type of operations.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> In general this is a bad idea.  There are basically 3 kinds of code you can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> write with Twisted:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   1. Infrastructure code, which implements a protocol and provides APIs for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parsing and dealing with events.  This kind of code should never contain a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reactor.stop at all.
</I>
&gt;<i>Actually is type 1, but there are horrible (network) conditions were de
</I>&gt;<i>application should stop.
</I>
No, there aren't.  What happens when I run your application in-process with my webserver?  Should the webserver stop simply because your protocol is not working?

&gt;<i>Even it's not type 3, I get your point. And thats why I didn't want to write
</I>&gt;<i>ANY reactor.stop() call, instead just raise exceptions- And have a unnified
</I>&gt;<i>reactor.stop() inside somewhere in twistd. But it seems I need to think
</I>&gt;<i>another solution. Right now as a workaround, reactor.stop() will be inside my
</I>&gt;<i>exception's __init__ function ;-)
</I>
Just don't call reactor.stop at all unless you are writing top-level infrastructure code.  Your application should have some other, more structured way of reporting fatal shut-down errors to its run container (e.g. runContainer.applicationEncounteredFatal(xxx)), not simply raising exceptions and hoping someone is listening.  Unless you give more specifics that indicate that your special case is special-er than any other I've seen before, I'll stand by this. :)

&gt;&gt;<i> Don't try to always stop the *process* when your program is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complete: stop the *program* by keeping a Deferred around which represents
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its complete run.  That way the *driver* for the program is responsible for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stopping it, and when you want to aggregate multiple runs of it, you can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easily use a tool like DeferredList, or do something different in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> callbacks at the end.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I couldn't understand much of this last parragraph (my English reading could
</I>&gt;<i>be part of the problem). I understand algorithms mucho more when are written
</I>&gt;<i>in python instead of English,  Do you have a link to some code explaning
</I>&gt;<i>this?
</I>
It's hard for me to think of a program which does this in a simple way.  If I can think of one I will post an example.
