&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I currently use Perspective Broker for a number of projects.  As time
</I>&gt;<i>has gone by I have really come to appreciate having a full two-way
</I>&gt;<i>network protocol.  But, my company has lots of Java programmers  and
</I>&gt;<i>they do lots of &quot;serious&quot; (read, pain in the ass) web services and
</I>&gt;<i>grid services stuff.  I would like to be able to get the many Python
</I>&gt;<i>things I have playing nicely with the many Java things floating around
</I>&gt;<i>here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thus, AMP is extremely attractive.  There is one problem that I have
</I>&gt;<i>though.  We do high performance scientific computing and deal with
</I>&gt;<i>extremely large tera/peta-byte data sets.
</I>&gt;<i>Thus we need network protocols that can send large amounts of data
</I>&gt;<i>around.  The focus of AMP
</I>&gt;<i>of small messages thus presents a problem.  There are really two usage
</I>&gt;<i>cases that I have in mind:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1.  Sending larger (maybe 100's of Mb) objects around that do fit in
</I>&gt;<i>memory.  These can be serialized easily (w/o creating a big pickle),
</I>&gt;<i>but I need to make sure that Twisted doesn't make extra copies of them
</I>&gt;<i>during the transfer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2.  Sending even bigger things that don't fit into memory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Any thoughts on the best way to address these questions using AMP.
</I>&gt;<i>Here are my thoughts:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>1.  Use a multi-connection approach like FTP does.  Use AMP for
</I>&gt;<i>control and the other connection
</I>&gt;<i>for the binary data.  It would be easy to use producers/consumers in
</I>&gt;<i>this channel to handle the large data problems above.  I don't like
</I>&gt;<i>this because I often need to ssh tunnel the protocol through firewalls
</I>&gt;<i>- two connections is unpleasant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>2.  Use AMP's inner protocol to run two protocols simultaneously.  My
</I>&gt;<i>understanding is that AMP doesn't support switching back and forth
</I>&gt;<i>between AMP and its inner protocol.  Would it be crazy to try this
</I>&gt;<i>approach?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>3.  Try to modify AMP itself to handle the large objects itself by
</I>&gt;<i>registering Producers with the underlying transport.
</I>
This is the planned direction for AMP, if that makes any difference to
your plans.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>It may sound like I just want something like FTP, but I also need to
</I>&gt;<i>send lots application specific control messages as well - and these
</I>&gt;<i>really need to be two way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.
