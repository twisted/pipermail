<PRE>Hello,

The reliability of our trac instance is ludicrous.  It is becoming
extremely difficult to do any work on Twisted, particularly during the
hours when America is asleep.

I'm very grateful for Jp's tireless efforts in making trac work as
much as it has.  I have some idea of how busy he is, and can imagine
how frustrating the task must be.  However, we can't continue running
our issue tracker like this.

First question is, what is causing the outages? People on #twisted
have commented that they haven't seen similar behaviour on their own
tracs. The outages are so frequent that this is becoming an FAQ.

The second question is, how can I help trac to work better? Would it
help to throw more hardware at the problem? Should we switch to
another tracker? (blech) Are there open tickets on trac itself that I
could submit patches for?

Finally, assuming Twisted's trac isn't going to get much better any
time soon, I would greatly appreciate being given the permissions and
training to restore trac. I think it would also be a good idea to
share the responsibility with someone in a European timezone.

Thanks,
jml
