<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm writing some modules for integrating SQLALchemy with Twisted.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The idea is to write a custom Pool, EngineStrategy and Engine for Twisted.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I would like to know if there are some other people working on this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (excluding sAsync)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there really a good reason for having *two* different efforts to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> integrate Twisted with a single other library?  Surely it must be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible to collaborate somehow.
</I>
I agree with Glyph. I've put a ton of effort into sAsync, which would
cost thousands of dollars at even a fraction of what I charge for &quot;real&quot;
work. Why not make use of that?

It is GPL'd, but I have one user implementing it in a commercial project
now under a special license that he obtained by doing some coding of his
own for me. (My thanks to the Twisted developers for making Twisted
itself available under a no-strings-attached license, and thus providing
me the opportunity for that sort of modest compensation.)

&gt;<i> This works because Engine implements the Connectable interface.
</I>&gt;<i> There is an issue here: if a query/table is bound to this Engine, every
</I>&gt;<i> query will run in a separate thread; this is not what one want when
</I>&gt;<i> inside a transaction).
</I>
Perhaps you should take a closer look at what sAsync does before
dismissing it. sAsync has a taskqueue module that it uses to queue up
transactions so that they are *all* run in a single, dedicated thread.

&gt;<i> More complex is the integration with sqlalchemy session handling.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As an example with Nevow:
</I>&gt;<i> - a thread retrieve an object from the database
</I>&gt;<i> - another thread modify the object
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be much simple if the two operations occur in the same thread
</I>&gt;<i> (this require to run renderHTTP or locateChild in a separate thread but
</I>&gt;<i> I ignore if this is safe).
</I>
Again, the two operations *do* run in the same thread under sAsync, as
do all other SQLAlchemy operations that are run via methods of
AccessBroker. All you have to do is decorate the method with @transact
and it will run via the queue and the dedicated thread.

So, you may not want to re-invent the wheel on this one. By the way, I
try to be responsive to user comments, ideas, and patches. Some have
already improved sAsync quite a bit.

Best regards,
Ed Suominen
