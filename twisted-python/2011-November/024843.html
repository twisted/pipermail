As far as I know (having written most of the documentation in the linked
wiki page, and from a brief skim through the git-svn manpage) it's
impossible to make a &quot;shallow&quot; clone with git-svn (something like an
ordinary &quot;svn checkout&quot;, or &quot;git clone --depth N&quot;), so anyone who wants
to contribute to Twisted via git needs to clone the repository from
scratch (potentially overloading the SVN server, although nobody seemed
to notice or complain when I was doing my git-svn clone), or just copy
a tarball of somebody's comprehensive, elaborate, automatic mirroring
setup.

I'm not sure why I didn't document how to properly clone the Twisted SVN
repo with git-svn; I don't recall it being too hard (with the exception
of some old, closed branches with '+' in the name which I just blew
away), but it did take long enough that I didn't really want to
experiment and risk overloading the SVN server. 

With access to the SVN server over a local network, or with a lot of
patience, it shouldn't take much messing about to figure out canonical
&quot;make a clone&quot; and &quot;update your clone&quot; instructions.

&gt;<i> Right now, patches from git users show up in a variety of states of
</I>&gt;<i> confusion and disarray: they're either based on an incredibly ancient
</I>&gt;<i> version of trunk, or they're on a non-master branch of some repository
</I>&gt;<i> and they don't say that,
</I>
I'm not sure why that would be, except that possibly they found
a tarball of somebody else's git-svn clone and forgot to update it, or
they're confused about the best way to get cloned from some unofficial,
no-longer updated mirror. Fixing this probably depends on having the
canonical, correct, convenient instructions and advertising them widely.

&gt;<i> or they include 'a/' and 'b/' prefixes (i.e.  they're -p1 patches when
</I>&gt;<i> they should be -p0 according to the submission standard).
</I>
Git doesn't provide any way to generate patches without the fixed,
standard prefixes. As I understand it, this is to prevent ambiguities
when filenames contain spaces. So, you're probably stuck with it. :/
