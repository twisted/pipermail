</I>&gt;<i> I come from FreeDesktop. We have a git-driven development process

</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/">http://cgit.freedesktop.org/</A>) which covers everybody's personal and
</I>&gt;<i> project repos.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The contribution process is simple and straightforward. Patches are
</I>&gt;<i> sent in through the project mailing lists. People can also send
</I>&gt;<i> patches through auxiliary channels like pastebins and IRC or the
</I>&gt;<i> Bugzilla, although that's discouraged. When contributors become
</I>&gt;<i> prolific enough, they can apply for account access, which lets them
</I>&gt;<i> host repos on fd.o through the magic of userdirs. Code is meritocratic
</I>&gt;<i> and community-based; when in doubt, a committer can ask for code
</I>&gt;<i> review. It varies from project to project; fd.o is a *big* umbrella.

Boy, thanks Gmail. I really appreciated that.

Anyway, mesa/mesa has dozens upon dozens of branches. Just like
Twisted. It works well.

So, Github adds *zero* fun to this. Its issue tracker is roughly as
unfun as Bugzilla. Pull requests are frustrating; I find myself just
pulling their code using standard git tools and ignoring the
auto-merge tool. I don't really enjoy having messages sent to me
*through* Github when we could just use email, like civilized people.
I view Github as a source of bandwidth and space to avoid having to
host my numerous personal repositories on a personal server. It's a
convenience and crutch. TM is not short of resources; there certainly
could be a git.tm.com or cgit.tm.com and userdir-powered repositories.
Admittedly, this is at odds with the current direction towards LP and
Bazaar, but I think it's a lot better than letting us rely on Github.
