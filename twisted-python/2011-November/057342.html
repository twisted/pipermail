</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The wiki mentions the first one a couple of times, although strictly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;speaking you need to add &quot;/.git&quot; to the end to get a URL you can clone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;from. Apart from being out-of-date, it seems to be missing a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;branches (there's only 56, and it stopped updating in 2011-03; my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;personal git-svn hasn't been updated since 2010-09 and has 2062
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;branches), it hasn't correctly imported the branches under &quot;releases&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;and the only tags are &quot;last_vfs_and_web2&quot; and &quot;releases&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's out of date because no one who knows how to keep it updated has 
</I>&gt;<i> taken the necessary steps for that to happen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are there other problems with it which can only be fixed by starting 
</I>&gt;<i> over?
</I>
I suspect that the other problems I mentioned can only be fixed by
starting over, yes.

&gt;<i> The point I am trying to convey is that performing some one-off import 
</I>&gt;<i> operation has been done before, repeatedly.  What's going to be 
</I>&gt;<i> different this time that causes the clone to stay up to date?
</I>
I fully expect that whatever broke previous attempts will break this new
attempt too. The difference will be that since there's a record of how
the new repository was created, and assuming there'll be a record of
what happened when the new repository broke, this time we'll be able to
reproduce the problem and work out a solution.

&gt;<i> &gt;I guess it's not strictly necessary to have tags or releases imported
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;if the goal is to let people develop patches against trunk, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;fact that branches are missing worries me - if a Twisted committer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;adds your patch to a branch, you want to be confident that the new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;branch will actually show up when you update your repository.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed.  Is this something that's addressed by the git command in your 
</I>&gt;<i> earlier email?
</I>
The &quot;--stdlayout&quot; parameter causes git-svn to import branches in the
standard SVN &quot;branches&quot; directory, which is where Twisted seems to keep
its feature branches (the most important ones for people working on
patches).

With some effort it might be possible to import release branches in
&quot;branches/releases&quot;, but that's obviously a lesser priority.

&gt;<i> &gt;As for the other two, this is the first I've heard of them. Is there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;any documentation about how they differ, are there records of how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;these repositories were created and/or updated that I could add to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the GitMirror wiki-page?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have no idea where they came from or how they differ.
</I>
It turns out Twisted2 is the newest (July 2011) and has about the right
number of branches. It also seems to have imported the various
&quot;ctrl+backslash-2371+2123&quot; branches that I recall causing issues before.
On the other hand, it still imports &quot;branches/releases&quot; as a single
branch, and has no tags. &quot;Twisted3&quot; might have been created for one of
those reasons... or possibly for some other reason that's not
immediately obvious.
