Tim: you're right that there isn't much interest among the current Twisted core development team.  But the whole point of having a Git mirror (and a presence on Github, which I think is the next step) is to attract new developers to this community.

That's why the topic of this thread is &quot;Twisted Project Jobs Volunteer&quot;.  We're asking for someone with expertise in this area to step up, volunteer to help maintain this mirror, which should help us attract more people who are interested in the same going forward.

Is that person you?  You're already maintaining the wiki page - and your participation in this thread has probably taken more time than the setup would have, if you have the relevant knowledge :).  Is there something you're missing?  Some administrative credential, perhaps?  Information about where the relevant code lives?  If you're up for continuing on this, I'm sure we can get you whatever you need :).

Thanks,
