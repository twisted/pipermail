You're right, of course, but lots of other projects (Django comes to mind) have a Github presence without using Github or Git as their primary development tool.  See here: &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/django">https://github.com/django</A>&gt;.

We already have &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/twisted">https://github.com/twisted</A>&gt;, it's just broken; despite the brokenness it has 14 watchers and 5 forks _anyway_, so clearly people want to use it.  This is definitely worse than having a mirror that was updated and working correctly.

Welcome to open source.  It's all a never-ending thankless slog :-).

Really the most important thing here though is just to get the automatic mirroring initially set up, not the never-ending ambassadorial work.  That way git users wouldn't _need_ elaborate instructions as to what to clone and how; if we just say &quot;get twisted from github&quot; and have that automatically updated it would be easier for everyone.
