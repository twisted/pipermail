JP asked me to say something, so...

I come from FreeDesktop. We have a git-driven development process
which doesn't depend on Github. There is a cgit
(<A HREF="http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/about/">http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/about/</A>) instance running on fd.o
(<A HREF="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/">http://cgit.freedesktop.org/</A>) which covers everybody's personal and
project repos.

The contribution process is simple and straightforward. Patches are
sent in through the project mailing lists. People can also send
patches through auxiliary channels like pastebins and IRC or the
Bugzilla, although that's discouraged. When contributors become
prolific enough, they can apply for account access, which lets them
host repos on fd.o through the magic of userdirs. Code is meritocratic
and community-based; when in doubt, a committer can ask for code
review. It varies from project to project; fd.o is a *big* umbrella.
Branches are very common for contested or complex changes; look at
e.g. mesa/mesa for an example of
