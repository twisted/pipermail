</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Has anyone had much experience with serial flow control in twisted?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't. :)  It sounds like this may not really have much to do with 
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted, though.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I've been using a twisted serial port in my gtk+ software for quite a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;while
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;now, and I can get xonxoff flow control to work, but for some reason,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;rtscts flow control isn't working (or I may be using it wrong).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I'm connecting the software, via a usb-serial cable, to a Datalogic 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;barcode
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;scanner cradle.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I've been able to replicate this problem with pyserial as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you perhaps already know, Twisted's serial port support is 
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in terms of pyserial - and the layer Twisted adds is very 
</I>&gt;<i> thin.  So the problem you experience with pyserial is probably exactly 
</I>&gt;<i> the same as the problem you experience with Twisted, since the latter is 
</I>&gt;<i> actually the same code as the former.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Without flow control on, I can for example, send a particular serial 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;string
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;to the cradle, and the cradle replies instantly with it's software 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(as a string).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;If I scan a barcode, this also instantly shows up in 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;twisted/pyserial/etc
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(as a string).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;With xonxoff flow control on in both the software and cradle, the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;serial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;connection works exactly the same as having no flow control on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;With rtscts flow control on in both the software and cradle however, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;cradle doesn't reply instantly with it's software version when the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;correct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;string is sent.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;However, a scanned barcode shows up instantly in the twisted/pyserial
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;software, and if you've previously requested the cradle software 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;version,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the software version string only shows up directly after receiving a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;barcode string.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Am I doing something wrong, or does anyone know what might be going on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;here?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know that the device supports RTS/CTS?  Do you know that the USB 
</I>&gt;<i> driver for the device supports it?  Do you know that the USB driver 
</I>&gt;<i> support for it is bug free? :)
</I>
You also need to know that the serial cable(s) include the necessary 
leads, and that the null modem (or whatever) properly crosses them over.

An RS-232 break-out box (if they are still available) would be very
helpful here.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry I can't add anything more helpful.  I think you want to be looking 
</I>&gt;<i> for the problem at a pretty low level, though.  Perhaps even at the 
</I>&gt;<i> level of measuring voltage on the RTS pin...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jean-Paul
</I>&gt;<i>
