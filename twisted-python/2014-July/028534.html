&gt;<i> While I currently believe that Tubes's API has firmed up and its

</I>&gt;<i> In this case, I actually want the twisted compatibility policy

These two points seem to be somewhat conflicting.

&gt;<i> So I am keenly interested in ways to address this problem rather 
</I>&gt;<i> than to work around it.  If we are going to try to develop new 
</I>&gt;<i> big Twisted features outside of Twisted,  maybe that's a good 
</I>&gt;<i> idea, but then we need a modified code-review policy for 
</I>&gt;<i> accepting those projects back in where they going to be 
</I>&gt;<i> subjected to code-review standards during development rather 
</I>&gt;<i> than in one giant burst at the end.
</I>
This seems like a reasonable thing to do. If all the code has been 
subject to review according to twisteds procedure, then it would 
seem to be reasonable to require that the changes needed to move 
the code in to twisted would need to be reviewed (so moving files 
around and adjusting imports and the like).

&gt;<i> Even if my opinion were inverted on all of the points above, I 
</I>&gt;<i> really want to avoid doing this - I especially want to avoid the 
</I>&gt;<i> part where it somehow doesn't work on Twisted's heterogenous CI 
</I>&gt;<i> system when we try to reintegrate it after apparently working on 
</I>&gt;<i> some other one-version-of-linux CI infrastructure for some time 
</I>&gt;<i> :).
</I>
It would certainly be possible to hook twisted's CI system to 
additional projects.
