I think you missed part of my point here.

I want to try tubes and see if they make my application simpler or 
better or faster or whatever.  My application depends on Twisted &gt;= 
14.0.0.  It doesn't matter how or why: that's what the metadata says and 
I can't use an older version of Twisted unless I do a bunch of stupid 
package/distribution related hacking that I don't want to do.  *So* much 
of the Python tooling has now moved to requiring and respecting explicit 
dependency declarations that trying to side-step these now is a 
significant hassle.  Separating tubes from Twisted solves this problem.

It's not at all a question of whether the code is stable or production 
ready or even works at all, it's a matter of packaging constraints.
