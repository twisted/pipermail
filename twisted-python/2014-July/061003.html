<PRE>Hi,

</I>How did you found this project? I could not find it on PyPi and I failed to
find any information about how to contribute to the project... I did sent
an email to the author.

I could not find a suite of automated tests.  I hope that asyncssh is
willing to compete with Twisted Conch SSH and improve on this :)

I only looked quickly over the server examples but I am a bit worried about
the SSH key auth example and how SSH key validation is done .. or not done.

I prefer Conch API. For example I don't know what to say about asyncssh
begin_auth()  method, which when it returns True, it cause the
authentication to be skipped... I would prefer a name like
should_ignore_authentication... or something which describes better why and
how it should be used.

<A HREF="http://asyncssh.timeheart.net/api.html#asyncssh.SSHServer.begin_auth">http://asyncssh.timeheart.net/api.html#asyncssh.SSHServer.begin_auth</A>

Conch source code is very readable (for it's size and age) and I manage to
put it into use just by reading the code and docstrings/API docs.

I started to learn Conch with examples from Stack Overflow and I remember
that Jean-Paul was very active there.... so mabye conch documentation can
be improved by importing some of those examples.

Contributing to Twisted is a PITA so I guess that for some people
(companies) this is a good reason to start a new (single protocol targeted)
project.( ex Tornado).

At this stage, asyncssh does not have a better public development process.


Cheers,
