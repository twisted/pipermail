It may not make sense to say that it is the same quality as Twisted proper right off the bat (on the other hand, it may well - I suspect tubes in its current form actually is a lot higher quality than large sections of Twisted) but that doesn't mean people (not to mention the tubes project) can't benefit from being able to experiment with it.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would love it if there were a way to release a package in an actually experimental state, and not just have the release of a package implicitly tell people that it's time to put it into production and demand long-term support for it.  Quick sanity check: go run 'pip freeze' in a production virtualenv you're running - what percentage of the version numbers that come back start with a zero?  I will bet a significant amount of money that it's not 0% :-).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> I think you missed part of my point here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I want to try tubes and see if they make my application simpler or better or faster or whatever.  My application depends on Twisted &gt;= 14.0.0.  It doesn't matter how or why: that's what the metadata says and I can't use an older version of Twisted unless I do a bunch of stupid package/distribution related hacking that I don't want to do.  *So* much of the Python tooling has now moved to requiring and respecting explicit dependency declarations that trying to side-step these now is a significant hassle.  Separating tubes from Twisted solves this problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not at all a question of whether the code is stable or production ready or even works at all, it's a matter of packaging constraints.
</I>
If you want to set up a development environment to work on this and try it out, I think you can do it right now.  I believe this simple and intuitive incantation will work:

pip install -e '<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">git+git at github.com</A>:/twisted/<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">twisted at 3c10ad3323f86d7194a3a4c9fd4e2e1bcd441fec</A>#egg=Twisted-tubes-1956-7'

That's a post-14.0.0 package with the appropriate metadata (and I didn't cheat and merge forward first or anything, this is the most recent branch as of several weeks now).  Doing exactly that in a mktmpenv and then doing 'pip install twisted==14.0.0' results in a 'requirement already satisfied' for me, and everything imports as expected.

I think there's still probably stuff to talk about regarding the rest of your message but if this can get you past your immediate hurdle that would be great :).
