The author announced it on the Tulip list.  Why do you ask?

&gt;<i> I could not find it on PyPi and I failed to find any information about how to contribute to the project... I did sent an email to the author.
</I>
It's on Github.  There's a link on the author's page.

&gt;<i> I could not find a suite of automated tests.  I hope that asyncssh is willing to compete with Twisted Conch SSH and improve on this :)
</I>
Huh, I hadn't gotten that far :-).

&gt;<i> (...) I prefer Conch API. (...)
</I>
Glad to hear it :).

&gt;<i> Conch source code is very readable (for it's size and age) and I manage to put it into use just by reading the code and docstrings/API docs.
</I>
I'm definitely glad that people can figure out how to use Conch, even given the state of its documentation :).  But it's definitely more of a struggle than it could be.  I think asyncssh's documentation style is one to aspire to: it's very straightforward, and tells you how to do useful things with very minimal examples.  I think there are some clunky bits of the Conch API which could be cleaned up, but even totally as-is we could probably asyncssh's their documentation outline, and possibly toss in a few more goodies as well.
