The traceback looks like it's from a bug in the error page generator,  
so the real error is obscured. It's using sqlite3. I'm no trac  
expert, so I can't actually answer the rest of your questions.

In other news: the master svn repository has been upgraded to 1.4.2  
fsfs (from debian testing), and thus trac now gets an up-to-date view  
of the repository. (currently synched via rsync every 10 minutes  
because that was most expedient).

So besides being horrendously slow, trac now seems to be in pretty  
good shape.

I think next it'd be nice if someone would install/enable/whatever  
the anti-spam plugin and re-enable editing the wiki for all  
registered users.

My point is that you are artificially combining your application with your infrastructure.  The reactor is always potentially in use by multiple applications, so it is not the thing that should be stopped.

OK.  So somewhere, there should be a MultiLTSPService which is the thing that gets stopped by these exceptions, I think.

Shouldn't it just get informed that it is in an invalid state, and re-start itself, rather than shutting down entirely?  I understand that this is a "panic" state that should "never happen", but you can flush that one bit of state without tanking the entire process.

So there needs to be an object that represents the "whole application", which has references to all these services.  The reactor should not be serving that purpose.

It's not too bad :)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] peer 2 peer, udp, stdio -> very confused
Message-ID: <d54d6da30612040126j7dfe2e8cg22ef676d8a71417b@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

first: I have been reading the topics on this list regarding apps that
need to be client/server at the same time, use udp, need to be able to
react to user input while the reactor is running with much interest,
but I'm very confused now as to how I should proceed with my own
problem.

In short: I'm trying to create a peer 2 peer application that has a
text-based gui (commandline), driven by user input and communicates
with other peers over udp (and occasionally over tcp, to transfer
files).

I'm just really confused over some basic concepts. Am I correct that I
can just create a simple class extending protocol.DatagramProtocol to
facilitate the raw udp sending / receiving? Then use that in a Factory
class (MyClientFactory) to 'layer' the p2p protocol functionality on?
Where do I put my stdio implementation then? And am I right that the
only thing needed for udp to work is to do a
reactor.listenUDP(portnum, MyClientFactory()) or do I need to use two
factory classes, one for the client 'bit' and one for the server?

I realise that's a lot of questions, but the sheer size of twisted has
overwhelmed me a bit and I'd appreciate any help you can give.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] robust listenUDP with N clients?
Message-ID: <45743EB9.3070204@acm.org>

hi folks

I am new to twisted and new to server programming. Nonetheless, I would 
like to build a robust client-server looping mechanism in which a server 
would listen for input from N clients, say 10, and react immediately 
when it receives data from them. I have a sample (see below) that 
appears to run well, but am not sure if it will scale under real network 
load and larger N.
(I am parsing the input data received from the clients and using it to 
calculate a fibonnaci series, just for testing. The reactor can be 
stopped with keyboard input (I am on a win32 platform)).

If you see any problems with this approach, please let me know !
Thanks, marc

You probably need to be more specific to get many useful responses.  What
do you expect N to go to?  Why do you use multiple ports?  Why are you
using UDP?  What do you mean by "robust"?  What does the Fibonnaci calculation
have to do with the application?  Is the keyboard input handling code
relevant or just part of the example?  Is win32 your development platform
or your deployment platform or both?

That is how UDP works with Twisted, yes.

Protocol factories aren't involved in UDP, since their purpose is to
expose the concept of a connection with a limited lifetime, a concept
lacking in UDP.

>Where do I put my stdio implementation then?

Standard IO is treated as a connection-oriented transport, so you
interact with it in much the same way as you would interact with a
TCP connection.  The primary difference is that instead of creating
a factory and passing it to connectTCP, you just create your protocol
and instantiate StandardIO with it.

Since there is only listenUDP, there's no place for a 2nd DatagramProtocol
to go.  You can manage both sending and receiving datagrams with a single
instance.

Hi Jean-Paul

I would want N no larger than 30.
I am testing only on localhost and have N ports instead of N computers for now.
Fibonnaci calculation: just a cpu cycle eating app for testing, will change.
Keyboard handling is important.
Win32 is development and deployment platform.
UDP choice: I would like the faster of the two protocols (UDP vs TCP), although TCP has congestion
control. Is TCP the better choice here?
Robust: will it work even under heavy network load

30 is quite small.  There should be no performance issues related to
the network layer.

Okay.  So ultimately it will be 1 port communicating with N computers,
instead of the current N ports all communicating with 1 computer?

>Fibonnaci calculation: just a cpu cycle eating app for testing, will change.

I don't think your original example realistically represented CPU load.
It seems more likely that you will have some work to do in response to
each request, which corresponds to datagramReceived

>Win32 is development and deployment platform.

Win32 is pretty crummy.  I have no idea how well anything will work on
it.  I generally assume that it won't, at all.

If that's the primary metric, TCP is a better choice.

>Robust: will it work even under heavy network load

If _that's_ the primary metric, TCP is still a better choice. :)

Yes, that is correct,  N computers, one port.
If 30 is a small number, what would be a large one; what is the upper limit?
I'll use TCP then (and move the code over to a suse box :) )

I have a t.a.service.MultiService() serving all this inside an 
t.a.service.Application, where should I write the "try:.. except:" code?

Rebuilding your house won't stop the hurricane :-) re-starting won't bring it 
to a correct state, just because it's a problem from outside, usually 
asociated with a (sysadmin) human action. I need the process to stop (and 
send some mails) so it can be fully reparied with qualified supra-sysadmins. 
The MultiLTSP server can't be a zombie forever... But then again, i'm new to 
twisted (less than 5 month) and probably i'm misunderstanding twisted's 
components.

I thought the main quit() was the reactor.stop(), my teachers were tutorials, 
is there any cleaner way to quit. There is a t.a.service.Application() should 
be used for this? should be used ANOTHER object?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] web2: http Content-Length header
Message-ID: <200612042216.17762.mailinglists@grimmerink.nl>

Hi all,

I'm using twisted.web2.client.HTTPClientProtocol to implement a HTTP 
downloader object.

In order to show the download progress, I need the Content-Length header, 
which is found in the server response.
But it turns out this header is being removed from the response, because it 
is listed in connHeaderNames, twisted/web2/channel/http.py line 217.

Leaving 'content-length' out of this list gives me the valid content-length 
header in the response.

Is it really necessary to remove the content-length header from the 
response?

Regards, Pieter

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Passing information from SSL postconnection check
	to application
Message-ID: <f33a4da20612050419q1ca5780ch340218b667d843@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have an application which uses M2Crypto authentication. I use the
wrapper supplied by M2Crypto, and can do postConnection check just
fine. I need to pass along some of the information from the client
credentials, but I cannot figure out how to do this.

The code looks something like this:

from twisted.application import service, internet
from twisted.protocols import policies
from M2Crypto import SSL
from M2Crypto.SSL.TwistedProtocolWrapper import TLSProtocolWrapper

def protocol_factory(factory, wrapped_protocol):

        wrapper = TLSProtocolWrapper(factory,
                                     wrapped_protocol,
                                     startPassThrough=0,
                                     client=0,
                                     contextFactory=ServerContextFactory(),
                                     postConnectionCheck=MyChecker())
        return wrapper


factory = ...

wrapper = policies.WrappingFactory(factory)
wrapper.protocol = protocol_factory
wrapper.protocol.TLS = True
factory.startTLS = True
factory.sslChecker = SSL.Checker.Checker()

factory = wrapper

application = service.Application('foo')
service = internet.TCPServer(8443, factory)
service.setServiceParent(application)

Currently the original factory is the factory from twisted.web2, but
I would like to be able to do this, on a general level, e.g., from AMP
as well. Setting the information into some global value is sure to fail,
but I cannot see how else to propagate information.

Correction, it turns out indeed it has to be removed. If it isn't stripped 
from the response, somehow the download stops after a single block of data 
has been received.

Since the content-length is saved in self.length, the following could be a 
workaround (and it does work fine here):

Add the Content-Length header again after calling setConnectionParams, at 
the bottom of allHeadersReceived (line 195 twisted/web2/channel/http.py)

  self.inHeaders.setHeader('Content-Length', str(self.length))

What exactly goes wrong with setConnectionParams when the Content-Length 
header is not (temporarily) removed is not 100% clear to me, so there 
probably are better solutions for this problem.

priceserver is under a substantial amount of load and twisted handles the
job handsomely.

Try it out at http://www.dohop.com

The backend of the site runs otherwise almost wholly on Python with bits and

Hope you see us fit for a mention and thank you for the amazing framework

Ok, I've added it to the ProjectsUsingTwisted page, but really, this
kind of thing (that is, a commercial service) would be much more
appropriate on the SuccessStories page -- it would be great if you
could give us a few official sentences about how Twisted helped you
develop this service so we could put it there.

It seems that you are running Linux, but don't have GCC (a C  
compiler) installed. Parts of Zope Interface (and Twisted, too) are  
written in C, so one is needed. Most Linux distributions install one  
automatically, but as far as I know some don't if you don't  ask it  
to install development software. Either that, or it's installed but  
not in your PATH.

Anyhow, there should be a GUI program for adding/removing programs,  
so use it to install "gcc". If not,  and you are using Ubuntu or  
Debian "apt-get install gcc" or for Fedora try "yum install gcc" and  
then try building Twisted again.

Please excuse me if you know all this already (you are building  
Twisted after all). It just seems like problem is that GCC is not  
installed/cannot be found.

Robert

The length is not passed to the Response object.

twisted/web2/client/http.py line 168:
self.response = http.Response(self.code, self.inHeaders, self.stream)

This response object is then passed to the responseDefer callback, which 
means we only have resultcode, headers and stream to work with.

Hi!!

I'm new in Twisted, and I'm having problems with Thread.
I was looking for it at documentation, and saw that it's not safe
(!?), but it's possible to run using twisted.python.threadable, I
haven't understood the thread examples using simple TCP and
ServerFactoryl, there is anything like reactor.run() using it or can I
only use threads as client? Can anyone give me a basic example?

Thanks!

You don't need threads to do most things in Twisted.  More than that,
threads aren't /helpful/ for doing most things in Twisted.  More than
that, most of Twisted was written so that threads could be avoided.

Sorry for not responding before. The Content-Length is removed from  
the set of headers and moved to an attribute of the stream. This is  
so that if anybody does content transforms before you get the data  
(e.g. transparent uncompressing/etc), the length and the data is in  
the same place, among other reasons.

You're supposed to get the length from the stream object.  
stream.length is an integer if the content length is known, and None  
if it is not known.

But stream.length is always None, even though the Content-Length is 
specified.

Pasted below is an example which demonstrates what I'm doing.
This is the response I'm getting:

<twisted.web2.http.Response code=302, streamlen=None>

And this is the response, when I add the line

self.stream.length = self.length

in twisted/web2/client/http.py, line 168:

<twisted.web2.http.Response code=302, streamlen=228>

You do not have gcc (the GNU Compiler Collection) installed. If you are
using Ubuntu Linux (or Kubuntu, or Xubuntu, or Edubuntu, or...), use this
command:

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential

If you are using another distribution, you'll have to come up with the
equivalent command.

Hey Eric,

Thanks for showing the Windows love.  The most pressing win32 issue
for me is the large number of reactor unclean warnings in the
win32event reactor.

>From #2091:
    One other thing: the win32-win32er slave had about 250 more errors
    with this branch merged than without it. win32er may not be a
    completely supported reactor, but introducing this many new errors
    to even an unsupported reactor makes me very nervous and I think
    we should try to avoid doing it.


Another very important issue is the buildslaves. As a UNIX[1]
developer, the buildslaves are my primary point of interaction with
the Windows world. This leads to two things:

    1. It's hard to care about the win32er and iocp reactors when they
are always red.[2]
    2. It would be very nice for the "remove-.pyc" step to always work.


That's it from me. Thanks again for taking the time to look after win32.

cheers,
jml

[1] I feel justified in calling Mac OS X a UNIX. It helps me sleep.
[2] Perhaps we should have two buildbot pages: "supported" and
"unsupported". win32er, iocp, tsr, pypy and friends can all hide on
"unsupported".

Thank you very much Robert.I have been using SuSE10.0 that contained
twisted.I could not find twisted when updating to SuSE10.1Wired.I am back to
suse10.0 again.I will learn more about twisted from now.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] delay_connect problems in twisted.enterprise.adbapi
Message-ID: <9bb390e70612072039r425951f8g6cc6c39ccd012cc2@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm having a problem using twisted.enterprise.adbapi.

The problem has to do with the 'delay_connect' option I send with my db
connection kwargs.  I want to send sybase connection appname and hostname
info.  The only way I can do this is using the delayed connect option.

I have the following standalone program example that works just fine:

vrdb = vr_db('billing_db', 'appname')
# vr_db just is a helper class for logical dbname -> db connection info

db_kwargs  = vrdb.return_kwargs()

db_kwargs['cp_min'] = 1  # one thread min
db_kwargs['cp_max'] = 1  # one thread max  = only one db connection
db_kwargs['cp_reconnect'] = 1  # reconnect if die
db_kwargs['cp_noisy'] =  1
db_kwargs['delay_connect'] = 1 #  do the delayed connect
db_kwargs['cp_openfun'] = vrdb._vrdbOptions

print db_kwargs
dbpool = adbapi.ConnectionPool(vrdb.return_import_name(), **db_kwargs)

# _vrdbOptions adds the following two things to the connection
# conn.set_property (Sybase.CS_HOSTNAME, self.hostname)
# conn.set_property(Sybase.CS_APPNAME, self.appname)


a = storage(dbpool, d)
a.run()
reactor.run()

run does a sql query.

   def run(self):
        ''' utility method if the script is called directly '''
        self.get_campaign_info('id', 588103).addCallback( self.print_result
).addErrback(self.error_happened)

This works fine and dandy.  With the hostname and appname showing up in my
sp_who optput (show's you who's logged in from where with what appname )

Now my problem is when I use the database connection part in
makeService(config) and pass a dbpool to a service, my service starts up
fine,  but when
I have a database operation I get this:



2006/12/07 15:46:17 PST [-] [Failure instance: Traceback:
twisted.enterprise.adbapi.ConnectionLost:
        /usr/lib/python2.4/threading.py:422:run

/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/twisted/enterprise/adbapi.py:64:rollback
        ]


So I've reverted my code to pass db_kwargs['delay_connect'] = 0 and it's
working fine as long as I don't try the delay_connect.   I'm  hoping someone
has seen this before and can point me in the right direction.  I'd really
like to have my appname and hostname show up on the db side.

I'm using twisted, sybase 12.5,  and the most recent Sybase module.  The
only difference is the way I'm connecting is one program is a tap created
from mktap and the other a standalone script.

>>> import Sybase
>>> Sybase.__version__
'0.37'
>>> import twisted
>>> twisted.__version__
'2.4.0'

Thanks

Sadly, I am totally unfamiliar with the sybase module and so I can't help you myself.  However, if someone else using the sybase module were posting to this list, it would be good to know whether this issue also occurs with the most recent trunk checkout of Twisted SVN.

If so, then at least it might be worthwhile to open a bug (with a minimal example attached) in the tracker.  If not, then at least you could use a recent release of trunk to work around the issue.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Perspective Broker Anonymous access..
Message-ID: <loom.20061208T141917-794@post.gmane.org>

I?m just learning how to use twisted PB and playing with the chat server...

I?m trying to create a way to allow authenticated and anonymous users into the
system but can't figure how to make it.

Here what i?m trying to do:

----------SERVER------------

    def requestAvatar(self, avatarId, mind, *interfaces):
        assert pb.IPerspective in interfaces
        return pb.IPerspective, MyPerspective(avatarId), lambda:None

p = portal.Portal(MyRealm())
c = checkers.InMemoryUsernamePasswordDatabaseDontUse(user1="pass1",
                                                     user2="pass2")            
                                        

p.registerChecker(checkers.AllowAnonymousAccess(), credentials.Anonymous())
p.registerChecker(c)
reactor.listenTCP(8800, pb.PBServerFactory(p))
reactor.run()

-----------------------------
           CLIENT
    factory = pb.PBClientFactory()
    reactor.connectTCP("localhost", 8800, factory)
    def1 = factory.login(credentials.Anonymous())
    def1.addCallback(connected)
    reactor.run()

-----------------------------

It dont work this way, giving me this error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
Failure: twisted.cred.error.UnauthorizedLogin:


Another way i tried to register only the AllowAnonymousAccess in the server but
the following error popped:

Traceback (most recent call last):
Failure: twisted.cred.error.UnhandledCredentials: No checker for twisted.cred.cr
edentials.IUsernameHashedPassword, twisted.spread.pb.IUsernameMD5Password, twist
ed.spread.interfaces.IJellyable


Looks like PB doesn?t support anonymous access but from documentation i saw that
i can do the following:

# anonymous users share one Avatar, named users each get their own
    def requestAvatar(self, avatarID, mind, *interfaces):
        assert pb.IPerspective in interfaces
        if avatarID == checkers.ANONYMOUS:
            return pb.IPerspective, self.anonAvatar, lambda:None
        else:
            return pb.IPerspective, self.avatars[avatarID], lambda:None


Just dont know how.... I already checked the PB internals (pb, portal, checkers,
credentials) and havent figured out how to add anonymous support to PB... if you
guys could help me I?m commited to add this support...

Thanks for all,

Carlos Eduardo

You have to re-implement the login process to support anonymous users.

PBClientFactory.login() cannot be used for this.

So, the examples given in
http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/pb-cred.html (below)
doesnt works?

# anonymous users share one Avatar, named users each get their own
    def requestAvatar(self, avatarID, mind, *interfaces):
        assert pb.IPerspective in interfaces
        if avatarID == checkers.ANONYMOUS:
            return pb.IPerspective, self.anonAvatar, lambda:None
        else:
            return pb.IPerspective, self.avatars[avatarID], lambda:None

I was looking at pb.py, portal.py and the way i understood, the whole chain
(login -> cbSendUsername -> remote login -> cb_Response -> remote respond) is
the responsible by the login process... if we send like credentials.Anonymous in
login(), all this chain needs to handle it... right?

Its a little strange why we cant have authenticated and anonymous users sharing
the same process since we can filter in the avatar given the permissions (like
example above).

Another question... is it interesting to twisted project to have this kind of
support? I mean, is it important to provide a way to this support in a patch to
the project or should I do modifications I need (if i learn how to) and keep
them to me?

Thanks for all and sorry if these questions are not in scope...

Carlos

Yes, unfortunately.  Without changing protocol-level code in PB, there is
no way the first branch in that if/else is ever going to be executed. I'm
not sure why the example bothers to cover this case; it seems misleading.

Yes, that is correct.  Despite the number of steps involved, it's actually
not very much work to adjust.

It's an unfortunate omission.  Requests for PB logins using a different
kind of credentials object are fairly common.

It would be a very welcome contribution. :)  Take a look at these pages,
if you haven't already seen them, for some guidelines on how to best
contribute the changes, and feel free to ask if you have any other questions.

I think this is one instance of a bigger problem: it's hard to care about  
a buildslave that is always red *if you don't know what you changed*. What  
do you guys think.. If buildbot told us which tests passed/failed since  
the last build, would that help at all?

I will see what I can do about this.

Thanks for the ideas.

Only if intermittently failing tests are accounted for in some way.

To answer the question "Does this problem exist in trunk?"  The answer is
yes.

I just checked out the trunk and reran my program by sending it a test email
( which calls a sybase db )

Here is the log output with the
<twisted.enterprise.adbapi.ConnectionPoolinstance at 0xb7d230ac> just
to show i've got a adbapi connection:

If this traceback fails to shake anyone's memory, I'll fill out a bug report
and lend my time/machine as assistance.  It's pretty strange how it works
when I have the db connect code running as a standalone program but not when
it's created via mktap .

Occam's razor says "run it as a standalone program"!.  Yes i'd have to
agree.  However, I would like it to work as a tapfile for simplicity in
packaging and logging etc.

thanks for your help

Subject: [Twisted-Python] NAPTR and some dns.py import issue
Message-ID: <20061209020553.60685.qmail@web50612.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,

There was a recent discussion: FWIW - I have a patch to dns.py with NAPTR implemented but it is a very hackish solution: I mean it serves very specific application and works fine and basis are there. 

I also faced the issue with the twisted/names/dns.py - specifically with "from twisted.python import components". Since I did not want to overwrite the  twisted/names/dns.py, I just took it, renamed and applied NAPTR patch, saved in my app directory and import it now under new name. Surprisingly it did want to import so in order to fix the problem I had to replace "from twisted.python import components" with  "from zope.interface import interface" and

change:
    class IRecord(components.Interface):

    class IEncodable(components.Interface):

to:
    class IRecord(interface.Interface):

    class IEncodable(interface.Interface):
respectively.

This is what I have - I would be interested in Twisted supporting NAPTR - let me know if I can participate.

Since I did not want to overwrite the  twisted/names/dns.py, I just took it, renamed and applied NAPTR patch, saved in my app directory and import it now under new name. Surprisingly it did want to import so in order to fix the problem I had to replace "from twisted.python import components" with  "from zope.interface import interface" and

I'm not sure I understand this issue.  There haven't been any imports of
twisted.python.components in twisted.names.dns in some time.  If you're
going to work on a patch to contribute, it would be best to do it based
on current trunk at HEAD, so that you don't end up writing anything which
will conflict with changes which have already been made.

I'd certainly be interested to see what you have.  I don't really have any
driving need for NAPTR support in Twisted myself, though, so it's mostly an
academic interest.  Still, if the functionality works, it comes with good
test coverage, and conforms to the coding standard, there's no reason at all
it shouldn't be added to Twisted.

So, I welcome any contribution you would be willing to make. :)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Using D-Bus with Twisted
Message-ID: <bfb564230612110603l5905a778g19a38d1a7126b036@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm about to start a project which involves adding D-Bus support to an
existing Python application that is based on Twisted.
The latest dbus-python versions include some tantalizing references to
planned support for integrating D-Bus into the Twisted mainloop.
However, I understand that this is not ready yet...?

What would be the easiest way to integrate D-Bus and Twisted right now? I
know that Twisted can use the GLib event loop, but will this work out of the
box? I found some references to doing this with older versions of the
dbus-python API, but nothing recent.

Does anyone have examples available that use the current API?

Please note that I asked on the D-Bus mailing list, and got the advice
to ask here; see:
http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dbus/2006-December/006630.html

Thanks,

-- Gavrie Philipson

Hi all,

Quick question from a pre-beginner with Twisted: Can Cacheable store not 
just the most recent value of a remote object, but the n most recent values?

Thanks,

They don't have that capability, no. I guess you could modify them to do  
that, but I can't think of why you would want to.

If you're not sure that's what you want to do, then it might help to  
explain what you're trying to accomplish and someone on this list may be  
able to help you.

This is a statistical algorithm I'm trying to parallelize to run on a 
cluster, and the serial version strongly suggests that the behavior I've 
asked for would be a big help.

I'll try to describe my serial algorithm succinctly, any advice on 
parallelizing it would be extremely welcome.

I have a bunch of objects which are nodes in a  directed acyclic graph. 
I've pseudocoded them in the attached file. What I'd like to do is push 
some of the nodes off to other processes running on the cluster and have 
them retain references to their parents. I'll then make repeated calls 
to all nodes' get_prob() methods and periodically update their values.

It would be nice to make Node.value something like a Cacheable. I'd like 
it to store n remote references, with a timestamp (this just needs to be 
an integer counter, as in the pseudocode) attached to each. When 
queried, it could return its timestamp and value as a tuple.

Thanks again,
Anand

Well without really understanding your algorithm I would say you should  
just implement this at the application level, and leave Cacheables alone.

  s.setServiceParent(application)

visiting / on port 8060 leads to www.example.com:80/path as expected.
/test returns the contents of www.example.com:80/path/test as
expected, but going to, for example, /test%20test returns a 400 bad
request.

It seems like t.w.proxy.ReverseProxyResource does not quote its path.
When urllib.quote:ing the rest parameter sent to ProxyClientFactory in
ReverseProxyResource.render, it suddenly works. (I'm using
python-twisted-web from Debian unstable, but it's the same in trunk.)

Am I doing something wrong here or is this a bug?

Magnus

I've submitted a ticket with my patches to names to make it support
NAPTR, so I guess someone has to choose :-)

Here's a plugin that lets you subscribe to wiki page changes. This

It would be good to have this functionality.  I have not checked the code
of that plugin yet, but I would rather err on the side of caution and not
make any further changes to our trac deployment, at least until we figure
out how to prevent it from bringing down the server on which it runs.

In the mean time, in case you aren't familiar with it, you can get an RSS
feed of all wiki changes from the timeline view.  Not exactly the same,
but perhaps good enough for the interim.

Also, there are free services which will forward arbitrary RSS feeds
to arbitrary email addresses. Getting closer to what that plugin does,
but it seems there's no way to get an RSS feed for only one page at a
time in Trac.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] What deferred can I use to detect when a server or
	client is "running"
Message-ID: <6ce0ac130612171410k3a9138d2v521ffc60d127d8e9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

i am writing some tests using trial and in my setUp methods I start
various servers and clients using listenTCP/connectTCP.  The problem I
am having is finding a deferred that will fire when:

1.  A server is actually listening.  I want to use this deferred to
trigger clients to connect...

2.  A client has connected.  I want to return this deferred from my
setUp method so my tests won't actually run until the client has
connected to the server.

I have some hackish ways that I have been getting around this, but
they seem a little fickle.  What is the "standard" way of doing this
in tests?

Thanks

Brian

I am intrested in doing some stuff with pyQT4 and twisted, and have been

how to get the reactor going in the QT4's event loop.

This is the reactor I am trying to use.

Is there any kind of tutorial for this, or example code from a simple runnable

listenTCP complete synchronously, so you don't need to wait before
connecting to a server started this way.

twisted.internet.protocol.ClientCreator.connectTCP will return a Deferred
which fires with a protocol instance after it is connected.  You can use
that, or look at its implementation to see how to do something similar
yourself.

You might also consider /not/ using real sockets in your unit tests.  It
is often easier to use a simulated transport.

twisted.protocols.loopback.loopback is going to be deprecated in Twisted
2.5, but it will be replaced with something much the same, loopbackAsync.
You can also just create twisted.test.proto_helpers.StringTransport objects
and attach them to protocols directly.  This gives you very precise control
over what you are testing.

Not as far as I am aware.  The code you are referring to was contributed
by a third party and hasn't even been accepted for inclusion in Twisted,
it's just attached to an enhancement request in the ticket tracker.  You
might want to contact the author for further assistance.

Great, this is very helpful.  It turns out the hack I was doing is not
that different from what ClientCreator.connectTCP does - passing a
deferred to my factory that gets fired at the right time.
I think I might just have a bug floating around.

I will have a look at the loopback stuff though.

Message-ID: <4585F125.3010504@imperial.ac.uk>

Does anyone have a notion of what the easiest way of doing this is? I 
feel some combination of wrapping a consumer around a FileDescriptor 
ought to work, or something similar to the stdio support, but I can't 
quite reason it out.

It is somewhat complicated by the weird behaviour of FIFOs depending on 
the state of the other end.

It not accept the path, because it create a new one on the server side.
I'm tring to  work with the sendToConnection and SenderProtocol, but I

JP,

I made some changes to pb.py and it now supports anonymous logins.

The only file that was changed is pb.py and I tried to make a new support
without changing the existing code as much as I could.

I?m new in Twisted.. and dont know if the solution I created was the best or the
most indicated. Suggestions are welcome.

Here follows the patch, the full pb.py file and an example based on pbserver6
and pbclient6 both supporting authenticated and anonymous access(just comment
the correct line in client).

The links to the files:

http://kmm.googlecode.com/files/pb_anonymous.patch
http://kmm.googlecode.com/files/pb6client1.py
http://kmm.googlecode.com/files/pb6server.py


Thanks and awaiting a feedback,

Carlos

Please open a ticket in the tracker (accessible at the very front page of twistedmatrix.com), and attach a unified diff to it.  If your code already contains tests and comprehensive docstring coverage of new functionality, then attach the keyword 'review'.

If you haven't already, you'll need to register for an account first before you can open tickets.

Hi all,

- Page: 
http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/defer.html

- Section: Multiple callbacks

The example ends with::

   # this series of callbacks and errbacks will print "Result: 12"
   g = Getter()
   d = g.getData(4)
   d.addCallback(printData)
   d.addErrback(printError)


The line::

   d = g.getData(4)

should be::

   d = g.getDummyData(4)



Should I enter this in TRAC?

Done. Ticket 2306.  It's the first ticket I enter here.
Let me know if there's any wrong.  I read 
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/IssueSubmissionGuidelines but there's 
not much in that page.

I could not find if there's a category for documentation, so I just 
placed documentation in the keywords field.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Transforming Exception -> pb.Error in a remote_foo
	method
Message-ID: <6ce0ac130612200917idd10387t8239fe8899b12c88@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In the Twisted docs it is claimed that in order to propagate exceptions over PB:

"The only special thing you do is to define your Exception subclass by
deriving it from pb.Error. "

This seems simple enough, but I am using PB to adapt a general service
that doesn't use pb.Errors (as the service is also adapted to other
protocols).  How can one transform a regular Exception to a pb.Error?
The following does not work:


    def remote_foo(self, f):
        d = self.service.foo(f)
        def raiser():
            raise pb.Error('I pbfailed')
        d.addErrback(lambda reason: raiser())        # reason is an
Exception, not a pb.Error!
        return d

In this case, the server still complains about an unhandled exception.

Any thoughts about how to do this?

Thanks

Brian

This is a bug in PB's handling of Deferreds which fail with an Error.
They are not handled in the same way as Errors which are raised
synchronously by the method to which the PB message is dispatched.

Could you file a ticket in the tracker?

Message-ID: <77d044440612202045v2725e63eydf6ef59e861d60f4@mail.gmail.com>

The documentation above says that credentials should be able to do
authentication with multiple passes.  However, I have not been able to find
any examples of it.

As an alternative, I was going to implement a user object with state that
determined what it was able to do.  I could force the client to conduct
multiple challenge responses to achieve the logged in state.

I figured it would be better to ask the mail list for the proper way to do
it first.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] SSL problem
Message-ID: <1166683784.4728.35.camel@infinite-loop>

Hi all.

I'm having trouble getting SSL working properly. I'm running a modified
t.m.pop3.POP3 server and it was running peachy on port 110, no problems
under real-world load, so I thought it'd be simple enough to add SSL
support by changing this...

INTERFACES = ('1.2.3.4','4.5.6.7', etc.)

for iface in INTERFACES:
    reactor.listenTCP(110, myPop3server, interface=iface)
reactor.run()

...to this:

INTERFACES = ('1.2.3.4','4.5.6.7', etc.)

sslContext = ssl.DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory(SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE,
SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE)

for iface in INTERFACES:
    reactor.listenTCP(110, myPop3server, interface=iface)
    reactor.listenSSL(995, myPop3server, interface=iface,
contextFactory=sslContext)
reactor.run()

Which worked fine when hitting it with a single client from my machine,
but failed miserably when hitting it from mail2web.com. Lots of errors
loading the message list and the messages. The log showed mail2web
connecting and then immediately dropping the connection. I tried
changing the code so I instantiated one sslContext per call to
listenSSL. That made it much better, but still not perfect. The errors
persisted.

So I tried dropping the calls to listenSSL, and wrapped the server with
stunnel. That worked perfectly, except since my host doesn't support
transparent proxying, my twisted app doesn't see the connecting client's
IP, and I need that, so that's not an option. It does implicate
twisted's particular flavor of SSL in my problems, though.

I don't know much about SSL, but I searched the twisted list and
couldn't find anything that helped, with the possible exception of a
query about support for SSL session resumption. I don't know what it is,
but it sounds useful. Anyway, if anybody could toss an idea or two my
way, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Steve

P.S. for posterity: I got a tip from this list to use authbind when
trying to bind my twisted server to a privileged port (e.g. < 1024). For
those of you who might have trouble using authbind to allow your
non-root user to bind to ports between 512-1023, you need to get the
authbind source, then comment out helper.c:76 and libauthbind.c:151, at
least for version 1.1.5.2, where it checks the requested port against
IPPORT_RESERVED/2. The man page squawks about prohibiting these ports to
avoid creating a security hole in conjunction with rsh, but since rsh
_is_ a security hole, I'm not overly worried about that.

P2P application
Client logs onto server with Publickey
Since the server does not necessarily have the same IP address, I also want
to authenticate the server's PK also.

As far as I know PB doesn't provide any mechanism for the client to  
authenticate the server. But it should be easy to implement.

You could use the normal procedure to log in to the server. The server  
provides various remote methods that you can call in order to have it  
verify itself to you. Once you (the client) are satisifed, then, and only  
then, do you consider yourself "logged in". You should be caution to  
prevent the server from invoking methods on the client, and vise vera,  
prior to authenticating the server.

I was thinking that there might be something more elegant.

If I am implementing the login procedure by hand anyway, it seems like it
would be simpler to just build it into pb.root.  I could skip the
realms/checker stuff.  I would keep the secure stuff in a
pb.referenceableand not return it unless the user passes all the
tests.  Am I missing
anything?

Thanks

Cred in general can - credential can have multiple methods that return
Deferreds and need to be called in certain order; but PB doesn't really
have pluggable authentication, so you may have to do it with extra layer

It's pretty difficult to say what the problem is without knowing the
specific error which is occurring, or having a complete example which
can reproduce it.  I'd _guess_ your context object isn't configured
quite right.  If you can post a complete example which reproduces the
problem, it would be much easier to diagnose.  At the very least, you
should share the SSL errors which are occurring.

Yeah, I understand that. I'm not sure where to go to get the errors,
though. I was trying to avoid putting up a complete example, because it
would be pretty involved, but I'll go that route if trying to dig up the
errors doesn't yield anything.

IOW, there's something wrong with the key/cert I'm feeding it? Calling
ssl.DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory(SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE,
>SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE) is so simple I'm not sure where I'd be going
wrong. BTW, the cert was provided by RapidSSL, and it's what I used with
stunnel as well.

How do I get at these? I didn't see any tracebacks being tossed. I'm
using 2.4.0.

It's possible (in fact, likely) you need to do something other than just
create the DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory, too.  There are a lot of dials
and knobs here - the context factory you're using works okay for a lot of
cases, but it isn't appropriate for all cases.

You have two pieces of data which are yours -  your private key and your
certificate (which is a csr signed by RapidSSL).  The client needs (at
least) one more piece of information, though - RapidSSL's certificate.

Try this.  Put RapidSSL's certificate into a file, subclass
DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory, override cacheContext, and on self._context,
call use_certificate_chain_file with the name of the file you put RapidSSL's
certificate into.

This causes the server to include it in the handshake which is often
required for clients to accept your certificate as valid.

At some point, I think connectionLost for SSL connections was adjusted
so that the SSL exception would be available.  However, the important
information is going to be on the client side, so unless that is using
Twisted as well (it sounds to me as though it is not), this won't help
you.  How to extract the extra information will depend on what software
is acting as the client.  Hopefully the above suggestion will resolve the
problem, though.

Perhaps you want TLSv1 instead of SSLv3?

Thanks for the reply, Itamar.

Gave it a try, and I don't think so -- mail2web simply wouldn't deal
with it at all. Of course, all I did was pass in a third argument to
DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory, SSL.TLSv1_METHOD. Should I have done any
more than that?

In the meantime, I'm gonna give JP's suggestions a try. Thanks, JP.

I'm not really sure what that means in concrete implementation terms. But  
it seems like you get the picture. If you need more help it's probably  
time to start posting code.

I found it here:

http://www.rapidssl.com/cps/rapidssl_01.cer

At least, I believe that's right, since despite some looking around, I'm
not sure how to verify by hand that my cert was signed by that CA. (I
played with openssl verify but it gave the OK to my cert without
pointing it at RapidSSL's root cert file, so I don't know that it's
doing what I want.) I've attached my cert in case you're interested.

Okay, I tried that...

class MyOpenSSLContextFactory(ssl.DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory):
    def cacheContext(self):
        ssl.DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory.cacheContext(self)
        self._context.use_certificate_chain_file(CA_CERT_FILE)

...and nothing at all would connect to it. But read on...

So based on this information, I whipped up a Twisted SSL client to hit
it so see what's wrong, and it tossed this out:

2006/12/21 20:36 CST [POP3Client,client] Traceback (most recent call
last):
        Failure: OpenSSL.SSL.Error: [('SSL routines', 'SSL3_READ_BYTES',
'sslv3 alert handshake failure'), ('SSL routines', 'SSL3_WRITE_BYTES',
'ssl handshake failure')]

Not sure if that's informative enough to suggest a next step!

Thanks for your help,

Steve

Never mind, I verified that was the correct root cert file, so now I'm
back to wondering why chaining them didn't seem to work...

Subject: [Twisted-Python] understand the ftp response
Message-ID: <458BB225.1030101@unipex.it>

Hi list,
I'm using ftp client and its storeFile for send a file to the server,
but I'm have some troubles to understand its response.

I receive, after the end of connection (fired by the SenderProtocol),
something that ( pprint.pprint(result) ):

[(True,
   [(True,
     ['150 FILE: /tmp/doc100.tif (Opening new data connection).',
      '226 Transfer complete (FILE: /tmp/doc100.tif).'])]),
  (True, None),
  (True, 'connection done')]

That isn't so readable, for me. I need only the last response (the 150
and 226), so I have to make a: result[0][1][0][1], that work, but is not
so understandable. Is there other soltions?

Thanks,
Michele

twisted.cred can indeed do authentication in multiple passes.  See the
login method defined in twisted.spread.pb.PBClientFactory to see how
it works.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Simple PB Example
Message-ID: <84535D81-9804-4DAB-914C-6B5F89C5C0DB@koen.nu>

Dear all,

Happy christmas!

I am trying to get the hang of Twisted and while the documentation is  
pretty clear I cannot figure out some basic things. I tried to build  
a little project to practise. I would love some hints, and I am not  
afraid to read.

Basically I want to write a simple server (Public Broker) which keeps  
a list of all connected clients. When one client sends a message to  
the server, I want the server to relay that message to other specific  
clients, but only those (yes basically an IM server).

So let's say I have a server and three clients:

server: Hello, I am here!
client #1: Yep, me too can I connect, I'm a girl?
server: Sure, I'll add you to my clients list!
client #2: Can I go too, I'm a guy?
server: Yep, you are client number two on my list...
client #3: Me too, me too, I am a guy!
server: Fine, but now let's do some stuff...
client #2: Server, can you please tell all clients that are girls  
that I'd like to see em after this session?
server: Let's find out who are female clients in my list and send  
them the message. Consider it done!
client #1: Thanks for the message, I'll see if I have time...

In the end client #2 would date client #1...

twisted-python-request isn't a list, it's just the management
interface to the twisted-python list.

twisted-python and twisted-web are both mailing lists for programming;
twisted-web is specifically for web-related discussion, whereas
twisted-python is general discussion for any twisted-related
programming.

Message-ID: <702805a90612301834q38ffef77l9c79e1afeaf540fa@mail.gmail.com>

I am working on an example:

from twisted.internet.app import Application
from twisted.internet.protocol import Protocol, Factory

class Fibonacci(Protocol):
    """Serve a sequence of Fibonacci numbers to all requesters"""


def dataReceived(self, data):
        self.factory.new
 = self.factory.a + self.factory.b
        self.transport.write('%d' % self.factory.new)
        self.factory.a = self.factory.b

self.factory.b = self.factory.new

def main():
    import fib_server    # Use script as namespace

    f = Factory()
    f.protocol = fib_server.Fibonacci
    f.a, f.b = 1, 1
    application = Application("Fibonacci")

    application.listenTCP(8888, f)
    application.save()

if'__main__' == __name__:

    main()

I have questions as the following:


   1. Is application.save( ) that make Fibonacci.tap file?
    2. testing on "twistd -f Fibonacci.tap" got message "Failed to load
   application: No module named fib_server".Can we use script as namesp?

Yes.  However, this is not the recommended way to create TAP files,
and TAP files themselves aren't even very highly recommended any more.
You may want to spend your time look at mktap plugins, .tac files, or
twistd plugins (which will be available in Twisted 2.5, which will be out
shortly).

You need to fix your PYTHONPATH so that fib_server is importable.

When 2.5 is released, what will be the preferred method of daemonizing
Twisted apps on *nix? Still .tac?

File deletion is allowed or disallowed based on permissions on the
directory containing the file, not the permissions of the file itself.

As long as your user has write permission to the directory containing
service.pid twistd should be able to clean it up.

My point is that you are artificially combining your application with your infrastructure.  The reactor is always potentially in use by multiple applications, so it is not the thing that should be stopped.

OK.  So somewhere, there should be a MultiLTSPService which is the thing that gets stopped by these exceptions, I think.

>There is a LDAP somewhere that has all client MACs that are in the group (eg.

Shouldn't it just get informed that it is in an invalid state, and re-start itself, rather than shutting down entirely?  I understand that this is a "panic" state that should "never happen", but you can flush that one bit of state without tanking the entire process.

>There are serveral  services involved in this application (the multicast UDP

So there needs to be an object that represents the "whole application", which has references to all these services.  The reactor should not be serving that purpose.

It's not too bad :)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] peer 2 peer, udp, stdio -> very confused
Message-ID: <d54d6da30612040126j7dfe2e8cg22ef676d8a71417b@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

first: I have been reading the topics on this list regarding apps that
need to be client/server at the same time, use udp, need to be able to
react to user input while the reactor is running with much interest,
but I'm very confused now as to how I should proceed with my own
problem.

In short: I'm trying to create a peer 2 peer application that has a
text-based gui (commandline), driven by user input and communicates
with other peers over udp (and occasionally over tcp, to transfer
files).

I'm just really confused over some basic concepts. Am I correct that I
can just create a simple class extending protocol.DatagramProtocol to
facilitate the raw udp sending / receiving? Then use that in a Factory
class (MyClientFactory) to 'layer' the p2p protocol functionality on?
Where do I put my stdio implementation then? And am I right that the
only thing needed for udp to work is to do a
reactor.listenUDP(portnum, MyClientFactory()) or do I need to use two
factory classes, one for the client 'bit' and one for the server?

I realise that's a lot of questions, but the sheer size of twisted has
overwhelmed me a bit and I'd appreciate any help you can give.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] robust listenUDP with N clients?
Message-ID: <45743EB9.3070204@acm.org>

hi folks

I am new to twisted and new to server programming. Nonetheless, I would 
like to build a robust client-server looping mechanism in which a server 
would listen for input from N clients, say 10, and react immediately 
when it receives data from them. I have a sample (see below) that 
appears to run well, but am not sure if it will scale under real network 
load and larger N.
(I am parsing the input data received from the clients and using it to 
calculate a fibonnaci series, just for testing. The reactor can be 
stopped with keyboard input (I am on a win32 platform)).

If you see any problems with this approach, please let me know !
Thanks, marc

You probably need to be more specific to get many useful responses.  What
do you expect N to go to?  Why do you use multiple ports?  Why are you
using UDP?  What do you mean by "robust"?  What does the Fibonnaci calculation
have to do with the application?  Is the keyboard input handling code
relevant or just part of the example?  Is win32 your development platform
or your deployment platform or both?

That is how UDP works with Twisted, yes.

Protocol factories aren't involved in UDP, since their purpose is to
expose the concept of a connection with a limited lifetime, a concept
lacking in UDP.

>Where do I put my stdio implementation then?

Standard IO is treated as a connection-oriented transport, so you
interact with it in much the same way as you would interact with a
TCP connection.  The primary difference is that instead of creating
a factory and passing it to connectTCP, you just create your protocol
and instantiate StandardIO with it.

Since there is only listenUDP, there's no place for a 2nd DatagramProtocol
to go.  You can manage both sending and receiving datagrams with a single
instance.

Hi Jean-Paul

I would want N no larger than 30.
I am testing only on localhost and have N ports instead of N computers for now.
Fibonnaci calculation: just a cpu cycle eating app for testing, will change.
Keyboard handling is important.
Win32 is development and deployment platform.
UDP choice: I would like the faster of the two protocols (UDP vs TCP), although TCP has congestion
control. Is TCP the better choice here?
Robust: will it work even under heavy network load

30 is quite small.  There should be no performance issues related to
the network layer.

Okay.  So ultimately it will be 1 port communicating with N computers,
instead of the current N ports all communicating with 1 computer?

>Fibonnaci calculation: just a cpu cycle eating app for testing, will change.

I don't think your original example realistically represented CPU load.
It seems more likely that you will have some work to do in response to
each request, which corresponds to datagramReceived

>Keyboard handling is important.
>Win32 is development and deployment platform.

Win32 is pretty crummy.  I have no idea how well anything will work on
it.  I generally assume that it won't, at all.

If that's the primary metric, TCP is a better choice.

>Robust: will it work even under heavy network load

If _that's_ the primary metric, TCP is still a better choice. :)

Yes, that is correct,  N computers, one port.
If 30 is a small number, what would be a large one; what is the upper limit?
I'll use TCP then (and move the code over to a suse box :) )

thanks for the tips,

I have a t.a.service.MultiService() serving all this inside an 
t.a.service.Application, where should I write the "try:.. except:" code?

Rebuilding your house won't stop the hurricane :-) re-starting won't bring it 
to a correct state, just because it's a problem from outside, usually 
asociated with a (sysadmin) human action. I need the process to stop (and 
send some mails) so it can be fully reparied with qualified supra-sysadmins. 
The MultiLTSP server can't be a zombie forever... But then again, i'm new to 
twisted (less than 5 month) and probably i'm misunderstanding twisted's 
components.

I thought the main quit() was the reactor.stop(), my teachers were tutorials, 
is there any cleaner way to quit. There is a t.a.service.Application() should 
be used for this? should be used ANOTHER object?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] web2: http Content-Length header
Message-ID: <200612042216.17762.mailinglists@grimmerink.nl>

Hi all,

I'm using twisted.web2.client.HTTPClientProtocol to implement a HTTP 
downloader object.

In order to show the download progress, I need the Content-Length header, 
which is found in the server response.
But it turns out this header is being removed from the response, because it 
is listed in connHeaderNames, twisted/web2/channel/http.py line 217.

Leaving 'content-length' out of this list gives me the valid content-length 
header in the response.

Is it really necessary to remove the content-length header from the 
response?

Regards, Pieter

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Passing information from SSL postconnection check
	to application
Message-ID: <f33a4da20612050419q1ca5780ch340218b667d843@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have an application which uses M2Crypto authentication. I use the
wrapper supplied by M2Crypto, and can do postConnection check just
fine. I need to pass along some of the information from the client
credentials, but I cannot figure out how to do this.

The code looks something like this:

from twisted.application import service, internet
from twisted.protocols import policies
from M2Crypto import SSL
from M2Crypto.SSL.TwistedProtocolWrapper import TLSProtocolWrapper

def protocol_factory(factory, wrapped_protocol):

        wrapper = TLSProtocolWrapper(factory,
                                     wrapped_protocol,
                                     startPassThrough=0,
                                     client=0,
                                     contextFactory=ServerContextFactory(),
                                     postConnectionCheck=MyChecker())
        return wrapper


factory = ...

wrapper = policies.WrappingFactory(factory)
wrapper.protocol = protocol_factory
wrapper.protocol.TLS = True
factory.startTLS = True
factory.sslChecker = SSL.Checker.Checker()

factory = wrapper

application = service.Application('foo')
service = internet.TCPServer(8443, factory)
service.setServiceParent(application)

Currently the original factory is the factory from twisted.web2, but
I would like to be able to do this, on a general level, e.g., from AMP
as well. Setting the information into some global value is sure to fail,
but I cannot see how else to propagate information.

Correction, it turns out indeed it has to be removed. If it isn't stripped 
from the response, somehow the download stops after a single block of data 
has been received.

Since the content-length is saved in self.length, the following could be a 
workaround (and it does work fine here):

Add the Content-Length header again after calling setConnectionParams, at 
the bottom of allHeadersReceived (line 195 twisted/web2/channel/http.py)

  self.inHeaders.setHeader('Content-Length', str(self.length))

What exactly goes wrong with setConnectionParams when the Content-Length 
header is not (temporarily) removed is not 100% clear to me, so there 
probably are better solutions for this problem.

Try it out at http://www.dohop.com

The backend of the site runs otherwise almost wholly on Python with bits and

Hope you see us fit for a mention and thank you for the amazing framework

Ok, I've added it to the ProjectsUsingTwisted page, but really, this
kind of thing (that is, a commercial service) would be much more
appropriate on the SuccessStories page -- it would be great if you
could give us a few official sentences about how Twisted helped you
develop this service so we could put it there.

It seems that you are running Linux, but don't have GCC (a C  
compiler) installed. Parts of Zope Interface (and Twisted, too) are  
written in C, so one is needed. Most Linux distributions install one  
automatically, but as far as I know some don't if you don't  ask it  
to install development software. Either that, or it's installed but  
not in your PATH.

Anyhow, there should be a GUI program for adding/removing programs,  
so use it to install "gcc". If not,  and you are using Ubuntu or  
Debian "apt-get install gcc" or for Fedora try "yum install gcc" and  
then try building Twisted again.

Please excuse me if you know all this already (you are building  
Twisted after all). It just seems like problem is that GCC is not  
installed/cannot be found.

Robert

The length is not passed to the Response object.

twisted/web2/client/http.py line 168:
self.response = http.Response(self.code, self.inHeaders, self.stream)

This response object is then passed to the responseDefer callback, which 
means we only have resultcode, headers and stream to work with.

Hi!!

I'm new in Twisted, and I'm having problems with Thread.
I was looking for it at documentation, and saw that it's not safe
(!?), but it's possible to run using twisted.python.threadable, I
haven't understood the thread examples using simple TCP and
ServerFactoryl, there is anything like reactor.run() using it or can I
only use threads as client? Can anyone give me a basic example?

Thanks!

You don't need threads to do most things in Twisted.  More than that,
threads aren't /helpful/ for doing most things in Twisted.  More than
that, most of Twisted was written so that threads could be avoided.

Sorry for not responding before. The Content-Length is removed from  
the set of headers and moved to an attribute of the stream. This is  
so that if anybody does content transforms before you get the data  
(e.g. transparent uncompressing/etc), the length and the data is in  
the same place, among other reasons.

You're supposed to get the length from the stream object.  
stream.length is an integer if the content length is known, and None  
if it is not known.

But stream.length is always None, even though the Content-Length is 
specified.

Pasted below is an example which demonstrates what I'm doing.
This is the response I'm getting:

<twisted.web2.http.Response code=302, streamlen=None>

And this is the response, when I add the line

self.stream.length = self.length

in twisted/web2/client/http.py, line 168:

<twisted.web2.http.Response code=302, streamlen=228>

You do not have gcc (the GNU Compiler Collection) installed. If you are
using Ubuntu Linux (or Kubuntu, or Xubuntu, or Edubuntu, or...), use this
command:

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential

If you are using another distribution, you'll have to come up with the
equivalent command.

Hey Eric,

Thanks for showing the Windows love.  The most pressing win32 issue
for me is the large number of reactor unclean warnings in the
win32event reactor.

    One other thing: the win32-win32er slave had about 250 more errors
    with this branch merged than without it. win32er may not be a
    completely supported reactor, but introducing this many new errors
    to even an unsupported reactor makes me very nervous and I think
    we should try to avoid doing it.


Another very important issue is the buildslaves. As a UNIX[1]
developer, the buildslaves are my primary point of interaction with
the Windows world. This leads to two things:

    1. It's hard to care about the win32er and iocp reactors when they
are always red.[2]
    2. It would be very nice for the "remove-.pyc" step to always work.


That's it from me. Thanks again for taking the time to look after win32.

cheers,
jml

[1] I feel justified in calling Mac OS X a UNIX. It helps me sleep.
[2] Perhaps we should have two buildbot pages: "supported" and
"unsupported". win32er, iocp, tsr, pypy and friends can all hide on
"unsupported".

Thank you very much Robert.I have been using SuSE10.0 that contained
twisted.I could not find twisted when updating to SuSE10.1Wired.I am back to
suse10.0 again.I will learn more about twisted from now.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] delay_connect problems in twisted.enterprise.adbapi
Message-ID: <9bb390e70612072039r425951f8g6cc6c39ccd012cc2@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm having a problem using twisted.enterprise.adbapi.

The problem has to do with the 'delay_connect' option I send with my db
connection kwargs.  I want to send sybase connection appname and hostname
info.  The only way I can do this is using the delayed connect option.

I have the following standalone program example that works just fine:

vrdb = vr_db('billing_db', 'appname')
# vr_db just is a helper class for logical dbname -> db connection info

db_kwargs  = vrdb.return_kwargs()

db_kwargs['cp_min'] = 1  # one thread min
db_kwargs['cp_max'] = 1  # one thread max  = only one db connection
db_kwargs['cp_reconnect'] = 1  # reconnect if die
db_kwargs['cp_noisy'] =  1
db_kwargs['delay_connect'] = 1 #  do the delayed connect
db_kwargs['cp_openfun'] = vrdb._vrdbOptions

print db_kwargs
dbpool = adbapi.ConnectionPool(vrdb.return_import_name(), **db_kwargs)

# _vrdbOptions adds the following two things to the connection
# conn.set_property (Sybase.CS_HOSTNAME, self.hostname)
# conn.set_property(Sybase.CS_APPNAME, self.appname)


a = storage(dbpool, d)
a.run()
reactor.run()

run does a sql query.

   def run(self):
        ''' utility method if the script is called directly '''
        self.get_campaign_info('id', 588103).addCallback( self.print_result
).addErrback(self.error_happened)

This works fine and dandy.  With the hostname and appname showing up in my
sp_who optput (show's you who's logged in from where with what appname )

Now my problem is when I use the database connection part in
makeService(config) and pass a dbpool to a service, my service starts up
fine,  but when
I have a database operation I get this:



2006/12/07 15:46:17 PST [-] [Failure instance: Traceback:
twisted.enterprise.adbapi.ConnectionLost:
        /usr/lib/python2.4/threading.py:422:run

/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/twisted/python/threadpool.py:148:_worker

/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/twisted/python/context.py:59:callWithContext


/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/twisted/python/context.py:37:callWithContext
        --- <exception caught here> ---

/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/twisted/internet/threads.py:25:_putResultInDeferred


/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/twisted/enterprise/adbapi.py:379:_runInteraction

/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/twisted/enterprise/adbapi.py:64:rollback
        ]


So I've reverted my code to pass db_kwargs['delay_connect'] = 0 and it's
working fine as long as I don't try the delay_connect.   I'm  hoping someone
has seen this before and can point me in the right direction.  I'd really
like to have my appname and hostname show up on the db side.

I'm using twisted, sybase 12.5,  and the most recent Sybase module.  The
only difference is the way I'm connecting is one program is a tap created
from mktap and the other a standalone script.

>>> import Sybase
>>> Sybase.__version__
'0.37'
>>> import twisted
>>> twisted.__version__
'2.4.0'

Thanks

Sadly, I am totally unfamiliar with the sybase module and so I can't help you myself.  However, if someone else using the sybase module were posting to this list, it would be good to know whether this issue also occurs with the most recent trunk checkout of Twisted SVN.

If so, then at least it might be worthwhile to open a bug (with a minimal example attached) in the tracker.  If not, then at least you could use a recent release of trunk to work around the issue.

Message-ID: <loom.20061208T141917-794@post.gmane.org>

I´m just learning how to use twisted PB and playing with the chat server...

I´m trying to create a way to allow authenticated and anonymous users into the
system but can't figure how to make it.

Here what i´m trying to do:

----------SERVER------------

    def requestAvatar(self, avatarId, mind, *interfaces):
        assert pb.IPerspective in interfaces
        return pb.IPerspective, MyPerspective(avatarId), lambda:None

p = portal.Portal(MyRealm())
c = checkers.InMemoryUsernamePasswordDatabaseDontUse(user1="pass1",
                                                     user2="pass2")            
                                        

p.registerChecker(checkers.AllowAnonymousAccess(), credentials.Anonymous())
p.registerChecker(c)
reactor.listenTCP(8800, pb.PBServerFactory(p))
reactor.run()

-----------------------------
           CLIENT
    factory = pb.PBClientFactory()
    reactor.connectTCP("localhost", 8800, factory)
    def1 = factory.login(credentials.Anonymous())
    def1.addCallback(connected)
    reactor.run()

-----------------------------

It dont work this way, giving me this error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
Failure: twisted.cred.error.UnauthorizedLogin:


Another way i tried to register only the AllowAnonymousAccess in the server but
the following error popped:

Traceback (most recent call last):
Failure: twisted.cred.error.UnhandledCredentials: No checker for twisted.cred.cr
edentials.IUsernameHashedPassword, twisted.spread.pb.IUsernameMD5Password, twist
ed.spread.interfaces.IJellyable


Looks like PB doesn´t support anonymous access but from documentation i saw that
i can do the following:

# anonymous users share one Avatar, named users each get their own
    def requestAvatar(self, avatarID, mind, *interfaces):
        assert pb.IPerspective in interfaces
        if avatarID == checkers.ANONYMOUS:
            return pb.IPerspective, self.anonAvatar, lambda:None
        else:
            return pb.IPerspective, self.avatars[avatarID], lambda:None


Just dont know how.... I already checked the PB internals (pb, portal, checkers,
credentials) and havent figured out how to add anonymous support to PB... if you
guys could help me I´m commited to add this support...

Thanks for all,

Carlos Eduardo

Just forgot... i´m based on pb6server.py and pb6client1.py from
twisted\doc\core\howto\pb\

Thanks.

You have to re-implement the login process to support anonymous users.

PBClientFactory.login() cannot be used for this.

So, the examples given in
http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/pb-cred.html (below)
doesnt works?

# anonymous users share one Avatar, named users each get their own
    def requestAvatar(self, avatarID, mind, *interfaces):
        assert pb.IPerspective in interfaces
        if avatarID == checkers.ANONYMOUS:
            return pb.IPerspective, self.anonAvatar, lambda:None
        else:
            return pb.IPerspective, self.avatars[avatarID], lambda:None

I was looking at pb.py, portal.py and the way i understood, the whole chain
(login -> cbSendUsername -> remote login -> cb_Response -> remote respond) is
the responsible by the login process... if we send like credentials.Anonymous in
login(), all this chain needs to handle it... right?

Its a little strange why we cant have authenticated and anonymous users sharing
the same process since we can filter in the avatar given the permissions (like
example above).

Another question... is it interesting to twisted project to have this kind of
support? I mean, is it important to provide a way to this support in a patch to
the project or should I do modifications I need (if i learn how to) and keep
them to me?

Thanks for all and sorry if these questions are not in scope...

Yes, unfortunately.  Without changing protocol-level code in PB, there is
no way the first branch in that if/else is ever going to be executed. I'm
not sure why the example bothers to cover this case; it seems misleading.

Yes, that is correct.  Despite the number of steps involved, it's actually
not very much work to adjust.

It's an unfortunate omission.  Requests for PB logins using a different
kind of credentials object are fairly common.

It would be a very welcome contribution. :)  Take a look at these pages,
if you haven't already seen them, for some guidelines on how to best
contribute the changes, and feel free to ask if you have any other questions.

I think this is one instance of a bigger problem: it's hard to care about  
a buildslave that is always red *if you don't know what you changed*. What  
do you guys think.. If buildbot told us which tests passed/failed since  
the last build, would that help at all?

I will see what I can do about this.

Thanks for the ideas.

Only if intermittently failing tests are accounted for in some way.

To answer the question "Does this problem exist in trunk?"  The answer is
yes.

I just checked out the trunk and reran my program by sending it a test email
( which calls a sybase db )

Here is the log output with the
<twisted.enterprise.adbapi.ConnectionPoolinstance at 0xb7d230ac> just
to show i've got a adbapi connection:

If this traceback fails to shake anyone's memory, I'll fill out a bug report
and lend my time/machine as assistance.  It's pretty strange how it works
when I have the db connect code running as a standalone program but not when
it's created via mktap .

Occam's razor says "run it as a standalone program"!.  Yes i'd have to
agree.  However, I would like it to work as a tapfile for simplicity in
packaging and logging etc.

thanks for your help

Subject: [Twisted-Python] NAPTR and some dns.py import issue
Message-ID: <20061209020553.60685.qmail@web50612.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,

There was a recent discussion: FWIW - I have a patch to dns.py with NAPTR implemented but it is a very hackish solution: I mean it serves very specific application and works fine and basis are there. 

I also faced the issue with the twisted/names/dns.py - specifically with "from twisted.python import components". Since I did not want to overwrite the  twisted/names/dns.py, I just took it, renamed and applied NAPTR patch, saved in my app directory and import it now under new name. Surprisingly it did want to import so in order to fix the problem I had to replace "from twisted.python import components" with  "from zope.interface import interface" and

change:
    class IRecord(components.Interface):

    class IEncodable(components.Interface):

to:
    class IRecord(interface.Interface):

    class IEncodable(interface.Interface):
respectively.

This is what I have - I would be interested in Twisted supporting NAPTR - let me know if I can participate.

I'm not sure I understand this issue.  There haven't been any imports of
twisted.python.components in twisted.names.dns in some time.  If you're
going to work on a patch to contribute, it would be best to do it based
on current trunk at HEAD, so that you don't end up writing anything which
will conflict with changes which have already been made.

I'd certainly be interested to see what you have.  I don't really have any
driving need for NAPTR support in Twisted myself, though, so it's mostly an
academic interest.  Still, if the functionality works, it comes with good
test coverage, and conforms to the coding standard, there's no reason at all
it shouldn't be added to Twisted.

So, I welcome any contribution you would be willing to make. :)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Using D-Bus with Twisted
Message-ID: <bfb564230612110603l5905a778g19a38d1a7126b036@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm about to start a project which involves adding D-Bus support to an
existing Python application that is based on Twisted.
The latest dbus-python versions include some tantalizing references to
planned support for integrating D-Bus into the Twisted mainloop.
However, I understand that this is not ready yet...?

What would be the easiest way to integrate D-Bus and Twisted right now? I
know that Twisted can use the GLib event loop, but will this work out of the
box? I found some references to doing this with older versions of the
dbus-python API, but nothing recent.

Does anyone have examples available that use the current API?

Please note that I asked on the D-Bus mailing list, and got the advice
to ask here; see:
http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/dbus/2006-December/006630.html

Thanks,

-- Gavrie Philipson

Hi all,

Quick question from a pre-beginner with Twisted: Can Cacheable store not 
just the most recent value of a remote object, but the n most recent values?

Thanks,

They don't have that capability, no. I guess you could modify them to do  
that, but I can't think of why you would want to.

If you're not sure that's what you want to do, then it might help to  
explain what you're trying to accomplish and someone on this list may be  
able to help you.

This is a statistical algorithm I'm trying to parallelize to run on a 
cluster, and the serial version strongly suggests that the behavior I've 
asked for would be a big help.

I'll try to describe my serial algorithm succinctly, any advice on 
parallelizing it would be extremely welcome.

I have a bunch of objects which are nodes in a  directed acyclic graph. 
I've pseudocoded them in the attached file. What I'd like to do is push 
some of the nodes off to other processes running on the cluster and have 
them retain references to their parents. I'll then make repeated calls 
to all nodes' get_prob() methods and periodically update their values.

It would be nice to make Node.value something like a Cacheable. I'd like 
it to store n remote references, with a timestamp (this just needs to be 
an integer counter, as in the pseudocode) attached to each. When 
queried, it could return its timestamp and value as a tuple.

Thanks again,
Anand

Well without really understanding your algorithm I would say you should  
just implement this at the application level, and leave Cacheables alone.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] twisted.web.proxy.ReverseProxyResource forgets to
	quote path?
Message-ID: <71e31fe60612130719k3f1f665bj313e8651c639d201@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

In a program like this

  from twisted.web import server, proxy, resource
  from twisted.internet import reactor
  from twisted.application import service, strports

  site = server.Site(proxy.ReverseProxyResource('www.example.com', 80, '/path'))
  application = service.Application("accesspoint")
  s = strports.service('tcp:8060', site)
  s.setServiceParent(application)

visiting / on port 8060 leads to www.example.com:80/path as expected.
/test returns the contents of www.example.com:80/path/test as
expected, but going to, for example, /test%20test returns a 400 bad
request.

It seems like t.w.proxy.ReverseProxyResource does not quote its path.
When urllib.quote:ing the rest parameter sent to ProxyClientFactory in
ReverseProxyResource.render, it suddenly works. (I'm using
python-twisted-web from Debian unstable, but it's the same in trunk.)

Am I doing something wrong here or is this a bug?

Regards,
Magnus

I've submitted a ticket with my patches to names to make it support
NAPTR, so I guess someone has to choose :-)

It would be good to have this functionality.  I have not checked the code
of that plugin yet, but I would rather err on the side of caution and not

Also, there are free services which will forward arbitrary RSS feeds
to arbitrary email addresses. Getting closer to what that plugin does,
but it seems there's no way to get an RSS feed for only one page at a
time in Trac.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] What deferred can I use to detect when a server or
	client is "running"
Message-ID: <6ce0ac130612171410k3a9138d2v521ffc60d127d8e9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

i am writing some tests using trial and in my setUp methods I start
various servers and clients using listenTCP/connectTCP.  The problem I
am having is finding a deferred that will fire when:

1.  A server is actually listening.  I want to use this deferred to
trigger clients to connect...

2.  A client has connected.  I want to return this deferred from my
setUp method so my tests won't actually run until the client has
connected to the server.

I have some hackish ways that I have been getting around this, but
they seem a little fickle.  What is the "standard" way of doing this
in tests?

Thanks

Brian

Subject: [Twisted-Python] twisted pyQT4 tutorial?
Message-ID: <200612171725.14733.twisted@x11.cjb.net>

I am intrested in doing some stuff with pyQT4 and twisted, and have been 
successful in getting some things to work separately, but am not exactly sure 
how to get the reactor going in the QT4's event loop.

This is the reactor I am trying to use.
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/attachment/ticket/1770/qt4reactor.py

Is there any kind of tutorial for this, or example code from a simple runnable 
application?

listenTCP complete synchronously, so you don't need to wait before
connecting to a server started this way.

twisted.internet.protocol.ClientCreator.connectTCP will return a Deferred
which fires with a protocol instance after it is connected.  You can use
that, or look at its implementation to see how to do something similar
yourself.

You might also consider /not/ using real sockets in your unit tests.  It
is often easier to use a simulated transport.

twisted.protocols.loopback.loopback is going to be deprecated in Twisted
2.5, but it will be replaced with something much the same, loopbackAsync.
You can also just create twisted.test.proto_helpers.StringTransport objects
and attach them to protocols directly.  This gives you very precise control
over what you are testing.

Not as far as I am aware.  The code you are referring to was contributed
by a third party and hasn't even been accepted for inclusion in Twisted,
it's just attached to an enhancement request in the ticket tracker.  You
might want to contact the author for further assistance.

Great, this is very helpful.  It turns out the hack I was doing is not
that different from what ClientCreator.connectTCP does - passing a
deferred to my factory that gets fired at the right time.
I think I might just have a bug floating around.

I will have a look at the loopback stuff though.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Writing to a unix FIFO
Message-ID: <4585F125.3010504@imperial.ac.uk>

Does anyone have a notion of what the easiest way of doing this is? I 
feel some combination of wrapping a consumer around a FileDescriptor 
ought to work, or something similar to the stdio support, but I can't 
quite reason it out.

It is somewhat complicated by the weird behaviour of FIFOs depending on 
the state of the other end.

I list,
I want to implement a not standard ftp STOR (STOT in the real) command.
It not accept the path, because it create a new one on the server side.
I'm tring to  work with the sendToConnection and SenderProtocol, but I
don't understand where the file (that on storeFile are passed as "path")
are opened (read) for after pass its data to the write method of
SenderProtocol.

I stop myself because I'm not able to send data throw the channel!

Can someone help me?

Thanks,

JP,

I made some changes to pb.py and it now supports anonymous logins.

The only file that was changed is pb.py and I tried to make a new support
without changing the existing code as much as I could.

I´m new in Twisted.. and dont know if the solution I created was the best or the
most indicated. Suggestions are welcome.

Here follows the patch, the full pb.py file and an example based on pbserver6
and pbclient6 both supporting authenticated and anonymous access(just comment
the correct line in client).

The links to the files:

http://kmm.googlecode.com/files/pb.py
http://kmm.googlecode.com/files/pb_anonymous.patch
http://kmm.googlecode.com/files/pb6client1.py
http://kmm.googlecode.com/files/pb6server.py


Thanks and awaiting a feedback,

Carlos

Please open a ticket in the tracker (accessible at the very front page of twistedmatrix.com), and attach a unified diff to it.  If your code already contains tests and comprehensive docstring coverage of new functionality, then attach the keyword 'review'.

If you haven't already, you'll need to register for an account first before you can open tickets.

Hi all,

- Section: Multiple callbacks

The example ends with::

   # this series of callbacks and errbacks will print "Result: 12"
   g = Getter()
   d = g.getData(4)
   d.addCallback(printData)
   d.addErrback(printError)


The line::

   d = g.getData(4)

should be::

   d = g.getDummyData(4)



Should I enter this in TRAC?

Done. Ticket 2306.  It's the first ticket I enter here.
Let me know if there's any wrong.  I read 
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/IssueSubmissionGuidelines but there's 
not much in that page.

I could not find if there's a category for documentation, so I just 
placed documentation in the keywords field.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Transforming Exception -> pb.Error in a remote_foo
	method
Message-ID: <6ce0ac130612200917idd10387t8239fe8899b12c88@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In the Twisted docs it is claimed that in order to propagate exceptions over PB:

"The only special thing you do is to define your Exception subclass by
deriving it from pb.Error. "

This seems simple enough, but I am using PB to adapt a general service
that doesn't use pb.Errors (as the service is also adapted to other
protocols).  How can one transform a regular Exception to a pb.Error?
The following does not work:


    def remote_foo(self, f):
        d = self.service.foo(f)
        def raiser():
            raise pb.Error('I pbfailed')
        d.addErrback(lambda reason: raiser())        # reason is an
Exception, not a pb.Error!
        return d

In this case, the server still complains about an unhandled exception.

Any thoughts about how to do this?

Thanks

Brian

This is a bug in PB's handling of Deferreds which fail with an Error.
They are not handled in the same way as Errors which are raised
synchronously by the method to which the PB message is dispatched.

Could you file a ticket in the tracker?

The documentation above says that credentials should be able to do
authentication with multiple passes.  However, I have not been able to find
any examples of it.

As an alternative, I was going to implement a user object with state that
determined what it was able to do.  I could force the client to conduct
multiple challenge responses to achieve the logged in state.

I figured it would be better to ask the mail list for the proper way to do
it first.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] SSL problem
Message-ID: <1166683784.4728.35.camel@infinite-loop>

Hi all.

I'm having trouble getting SSL working properly. I'm running a modified
t.m.pop3.POP3 server and it was running peachy on port 110, no problems
under real-world load, so I thought it'd be simple enough to add SSL
support by changing this...

INTERFACES = ('1.2.3.4','4.5.6.7', etc.)

for iface in INTERFACES:
    reactor.listenTCP(110, myPop3server, interface=iface)
reactor.run()

...to this:

INTERFACES = ('1.2.3.4','4.5.6.7', etc.)

sslContext = ssl.DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory(SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE,
SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE)

for iface in INTERFACES:
    reactor.listenTCP(110, myPop3server, interface=iface)
    reactor.listenSSL(995, myPop3server, interface=iface,
contextFactory=sslContext)
reactor.run()

Which worked fine when hitting it with a single client from my machine,
but failed miserably when hitting it from mail2web.com. Lots of errors
loading the message list and the messages. The log showed mail2web
connecting and then immediately dropping the connection. I tried
changing the code so I instantiated one sslContext per call to
listenSSL. That made it much better, but still not perfect. The errors
persisted.

So I tried dropping the calls to listenSSL, and wrapped the server with
stunnel. That worked perfectly, except since my host doesn't support
transparent proxying, my twisted app doesn't see the connecting client's
IP, and I need that, so that's not an option. It does implicate
twisted's particular flavor of SSL in my problems, though.

I don't know much about SSL, but I searched the twisted list and
couldn't find anything that helped, with the possible exception of a
query about support for SSL session resumption. I don't know what it is,
but it sounds useful. Anyway, if anybody could toss an idea or two my
way, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Steve

P.S. for posterity: I got a tip from this list to use authbind when
trying to bind my twisted server to a privileged port (e.g. < 1024). For
those of you who might have trouble using authbind to allow your
non-root user to bind to ports between 512-1023, you need to get the
authbind source, then comment out helper.c:76 and libauthbind.c:151, at
least for version 1.1.5.2, where it checks the requested port against
IPPORT_RESERVED/2. The man page squawks about prohibiting these ports to
avoid creating a security hole in conjunction with rsh, but since rsh
_is_ a security hole, I'm not overly worried about that.

P2P application
Client logs onto server with Publickey
Since the server does not necessarily have the same IP address, I also want
to authenticate the server's PK also.

As far as I know PB doesn't provide any mechanism for the client to  
authenticate the server. But it should be easy to implement.

You could use the normal procedure to log in to the server. The server  
provides various remote methods that you can call in order to have it  
verify itself to you. Once you (the client) are satisifed, then, and only  
then, do you consider yourself "logged in". You should be caution to  
prevent the server from invoking methods on the client, and vise vera,  
prior to authenticating the server.

I was thinking that there might be something more elegant.

If I am implementing the login procedure by hand anyway, it seems like it
would be simpler to just build it into pb.root.  I could skip the
realms/checker stuff.  I would keep the secure stuff in a
pb.referenceableand not return it unless the user passes all the
tests.  Am I missing
anything?

Thanks

Cred in general can - credential can have multiple methods that return
Deferreds and need to be called in certain order; but PB doesn't really
have pluggable authentication, so you may have to do it with extra layer

It's pretty difficult to say what the problem is without knowing the
specific error which is occurring, or having a complete example which
can reproduce it.  I'd _guess_ your context object isn't configured
quite right.  If you can post a complete example which reproduces the
problem, it would be much easier to diagnose.  At the very least, you
should share the SSL errors which are occurring.

Yeah, I understand that. I'm not sure where to go to get the errors,
though. I was trying to avoid putting up a complete example, because it
would be pretty involved, but I'll go that route if trying to dig up the
errors doesn't yield anything.

IOW, there's something wrong with the key/cert I'm feeding it? Calling
ssl.DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory(SSL_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE,
>SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE) is so simple I'm not sure where I'd be going
wrong. BTW, the cert was provided by RapidSSL, and it's what I used with

How do I get at these? I didn't see any tracebacks being tossed. I'm
using 2.4.0.

It's possible (in fact, likely) you need to do something other than just
create the DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory, too.  There are a lot of dials
and knobs here - the context factory you're using works okay for a lot of
cases, but it isn't appropriate for all cases.

You have two pieces of data which are yours -  your private key and your
certificate (which is a csr signed by RapidSSL).  The client needs (at
least) one more piece of information, though - RapidSSL's certificate.

Try this.  Put RapidSSL's certificate into a file, subclass
DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory, override cacheContext, and on self._context,
call use_certificate_chain_file with the name of the file you put RapidSSL's
certificate into.

This causes the server to include it in the handshake which is often
required for clients to accept your certificate as valid.

At some point, I think connectionLost for SSL connections was adjusted
so that the SSL exception would be available.  However, the important
information is going to be on the client side, so unless that is using
Twisted as well (it sounds to me as though it is not), this won't help
you.  How to extract the extra information will depend on what software
is acting as the client.  Hopefully the above suggestion will resolve the
problem, though.

Perhaps you want TLSv1 instead of SSLv3?

Thanks for the reply, Itamar.

Gave it a try, and I don't think so -- mail2web simply wouldn't deal
with it at all. Of course, all I did was pass in a third argument to
DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory, SSL.TLSv1_METHOD. Should I have done any
more than that?

In the meantime, I'm gonna give JP's suggestions a try. Thanks, JP.

I'm not really sure what that means in concrete implementation terms. But  
it seems like you get the picture. If you need more help it's probably  
time to start posting code.

I found it here:

http://www.rapidssl.com/cps/rapidssl_01.cer

At least, I believe that's right, since despite some looking around, I'm
not sure how to verify by hand that my cert was signed by that CA. (I
played with openssl verify but it gave the OK to my cert without
pointing it at RapidSSL's root cert file, so I don't know that it's
doing what I want.) I've attached my cert in case you're interested.

Okay, I tried that...

class MyOpenSSLContextFactory(ssl.DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory):
    def cacheContext(self):
        ssl.DefaultOpenSSLContextFactory.cacheContext(self)
        self._context.use_certificate_chain_file(CA_CERT_FILE)

...and nothing at all would connect to it. But read on...

So based on this information, I whipped up a Twisted SSL client to hit
it so see what's wrong, and it tossed this out:

2006/12/21 20:36 CST [POP3Client,client] Traceback (most recent call
last):
        Failure: OpenSSL.SSL.Error: [('SSL routines', 'SSL3_READ_BYTES',
'sslv3 alert handshake failure'), ('SSL routines', 'SSL3_WRITE_BYTES',
'ssl handshake failure')]

Not sure if that's informative enough to suggest a next step!

Thanks for your help,

Steve

Never mind, I verified that was the correct root cert file, so now I'm
back to wondering why chaining them didn't seem to work...

Subject: [Twisted-Python] understand the ftp response
Message-ID: <458BB225.1030101@unipex.it>

Hi list,
I'm using ftp client and its storeFile for send a file to the server,
but I'm have some troubles to understand its response.

I receive, after the end of connection (fired by the SenderProtocol),
something that ( pprint.pprint(result) ):

[(True,
   [(True,
     ['150 FILE: /tmp/doc100.tif (Opening new data connection).',
      '226 Transfer complete (FILE: /tmp/doc100.tif).'])]),
  (True, None),
  (True, 'connection done')]

That isn't so readable, for me. I need only the last response (the 150
and 226), so I have to make a: result[0][1][0][1], that work, but is not
so understandable. Is there other soltions?

Thanks,
Michele

twisted.cred can indeed do authentication in multiple passes.  See the
login method defined in twisted.spread.pb.PBClientFactory to see how
it works.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Simple PB Example
Message-ID: <84535D81-9804-4DAB-914C-6B5F89C5C0DB@koen.nu>

Dear all,

Happy christmas!

I am trying to get the hang of Twisted and while the documentation is  
pretty clear I cannot figure out some basic things. I tried to build  
a little project to practise. I would love some hints, and I am not  
afraid to read.

Basically I want to write a simple server (Public Broker) which keeps  
a list of all connected clients. When one client sends a message to  
the server, I want the server to relay that message to other specific  
clients, but only those (yes basically an IM server).

So let's say I have a server and three clients:

server: Hello, I am here!
client #1: Yep, me too can I connect, I'm a girl?
server: Sure, I'll add you to my clients list!
client #2: Can I go too, I'm a guy?
server: Yep, you are client number two on my list...
client #3: Me too, me too, I am a guy!
server: Fine, but now let's do some stuff...
client #2: Server, can you please tell all clients that are girls  
that I'd like to see em after this session?
server: Let's find out who are female clients in my list and send  
them the message. Consider it done!
client #1: Thanks for the message, I'll see if I have time...

In the end client #2 would date client #1...

My questions are about programming-related.

Thanks a lot.

twisted-python-request isn't a list, it's just the management
interface to the twisted-python list.

twisted-python and twisted-web are both mailing lists for programming;
twisted-web is specifically for web-related discussion, whereas
twisted-python is general discussion for any twisted-related
programming.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] script can be used as namespace?
Message-ID: <702805a90612301834q38ffef77l9c79e1afeaf540fa@mail.gmail.com>

I am working on an example:

from twisted.internet.app import Application
from twisted.internet.protocol import Protocol, Factory

class Fibonacci(Protocol):
    """Serve a sequence of Fibonacci numbers to all requesters"""


def dataReceived(self, data):
        self.factory.new
 = self.factory.a + self.factory.b
        self.transport.write('%d' % self.factory.new)
        self.factory.a = self.factory.b

self.factory.b = self.factory.new

def main():
    import fib_server    # Use script as namespace

    f = Factory()
    f.protocol = fib_server.Fibonacci
    f.a, f.b = 1, 1
    application = Application("Fibonacci")

    application.listenTCP(8888, f)
    application.save()

if'__main__' == __name__:

    main()

I have questions as the following:


   1. Is application.save( ) that make Fibonacci.tap file?
    2. testing on "twistd -f Fibonacci.tap" got message "Failed to load
   application: No module named fib_server".Can we use script as namesp?

Yes.  However, this is not the recommended way to create TAP files,
and TAP files themselves aren't even very highly recommended any more.
You may want to spend your time look at mktap plugins, .tac files, or
twistd plugins (which will be available in Twisted 2.5, which will be out
shortly).

You need to fix your PYTHONPATH so that fib_server is importable.

When 2.5 is released, what will be the preferred method of daemonizing
Twisted apps on *nix? Still .tac?

when I run a service through twistd
# twistd --pidfile service.pid  -y service.py

in logfile, I see:
 Warning: No permission to delete pid file

Because I run this service as ordinary user, not root:
application = service.Application("serviceMine", uid, gid)
, but the owner of pidfile is still root, not ordinary user!
so when I shutdown this service, this pid file cannot be deleted!

File deletion is allowed or disallowed based on permissions on the
directory containing the file, not the permissions of the file itself.

As long as your user has write permission to the directory containing
service.pid twistd should be able to clean it up.
