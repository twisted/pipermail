Yes.

Please mark the date, everyone: your fate is sealed.  Only 5 days remain.

While everyone should be fixated on fixing tickets in Twisted as often as possible, all the time, I do want to clarify that these bugs might not be the release-blockers they appear to be...

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3998">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3998</A>
</I>
While this is a regression, it *was* present in 10.0 and therefore won't be a regression from 10.0-&gt;10.1.  I think we should fix it, but if necessary, we should do both a 10.0.1 and a 10.1.1 maintenance release to fix it.

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4345">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4345</A>
</I>
This is currently open to track the work of creating a 10.0.1 maintenance release: the bug is already fixed in trunk, which will become 10.1.  Are we planning to do 10.0.1 concurrently with 10.1?  I was assuming that would be done later; if it was concurrent with anything, I was assuming it would be concurrent with 10.1.1.

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4320">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4320</A>
</I>
While this is &quot;just&quot; a documentation ticket, I would actually prefer that anyone with free time turn their gaze here first.  Deferred cancellation is a big deal and needs to be documented properly.  I'm personally more likely to argue for delaying (albeit not blocking) the release for this than anything else.

&gt;<i> Or review tickets: <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/report/15">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/report/15</A>
</I>

Yes, please.  I also plan to put &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/1442">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/1442</A>&gt; back into review either today or tomorrow, and I would very much appreciate a fearless reviewer to attack that once it's done.  The queue is starting to get pretty deep; and there are features which may be *already done*, even sexy new features like &quot;HTML5&quot; WebSocket protocol support, but won't get into Twisted 10.1 because they're stuck in the review queue.  Do you want that to be *your* fault?  Of course not!  So review some tickets this week!
