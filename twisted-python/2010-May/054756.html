Good to know.

This is useful information.  Our buildbot isn't *quite* PQM, but then... there's a strong case to be made that Jean-Paul is himself a robot.

&gt;<i> Using a DVCS would make it much easier. For example, Bazaar has

</I>
Looms still scare me a bit, but my intent was definitely that a DVCS (and yes, most likely specifically bzr) would be involved.  If you have any particular insight as to how one might go about doing that, it would be helpful.

For practical purposes, until the bzr-ness of the buildbots is more exposed, I was thinking that developers could work in bzr but push changes into svn branches for testing.  Does that sound workable?

&gt;<i> Also, +1 on the documentation.
</I>
I think we should continue this discussion after somebody has done at least one branch like this.
