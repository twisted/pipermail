It's a good concept, as long as all machines are on the same subnet and
they all have a zeroconf client installed.

I've had very bad experience with the old version of dbus-python that
ships with RHEL 5.  It just doesn't work reliably.  But if you're on a
more modern distrobution with newer versions of everything, maybe it'll
all work great.

If a pre-built program like scp or rsync doesn't do exactly what you
want, and you want the ability to extend it later, then I think it's
reasonable to do your own protocol.

&gt;<i> In the latter case it's convenient to use one port or two ports like ftp
</I>&gt;<i> does?
</I>
I prefer to only use one port if possible, because it's simpler.  And it
simplifies dealing with firewalls, if you ever have to do that.  As long
as you split large files into reasonably small chunks so the data
packets don't cause excessive latency for the control packets, it should
work fine.
