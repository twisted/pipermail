I don't think that counts.  I meant that we've done at least one feature that *successfully* used a set of stacked branches.  (I hope &quot;stacked&quot; means what I think it means here, and not some other crazy bzr thing.)  #886 is more a description of the failure condition here than a success.

#886 had one half-hearted sub-ticket, #3811, which eventually got abandoned and had to wait until #886 was merged to trunk anyway.  And lots of other stuff that I wish had been added at the same time for a coherent unit of new functionality (like the high level API) was spun out into a separate ticket because it was too hard to review all at once.

The high-level ticket in this case is really sneakily hiding out here: &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedWebClient">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedWebClient</A>&gt;.  (A few things are still open there but I doubt that this is still a good candidate for development under the proposed style.)
