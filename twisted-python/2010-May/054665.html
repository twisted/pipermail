The best advice I've gotten was from David Bolen; you can find an 
interchange between him and me on the SA list on October 22 and 23 of 
last year.  The upshot of it is, it shouldn't be a problem to use the 
SQL level if you're careful to keep the database accesses in a separate 
thread (and Bolen has done that); using the ORM level, however, can be 
problematic if you're tempted to access ORM objects in the main thread 
(since you're not directly in control of when database accesses occur).

&gt;<i> Here’s a couple questions that come to mind:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1)      Would the SQLAlchemy process also be a Twisted application with 
</I>&gt;<i> all the queries running as deferreds in the main thread, and blocking?
</I>
There might be value in reworking the SA concepts into a Twisted 
package, so that the asynchrony is &quot;built in&quot;.  I haven't heard of any 
indications of that happening.

&gt;<i> 2)      How would the Twisted process communicate with the SQLAlchemy 
</I>&gt;<i> process, using something like XMLRPC, calling methods to perform the 
</I>&gt;<i> queries? Or would the XMLRPC methods convey something more generic like SQL?
</I>
Well, Bolen used a dedicated worker thread to do the SA operations (all 
SQL level), passing functions to it to be executed in that context.  He 
also used a single connection in the thread to do all DB operations.
