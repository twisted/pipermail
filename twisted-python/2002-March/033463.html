It originally seemed to me that data-display would be a different
component. (Remember Sean's twisted.metrics, anyone?)  I guess you're
right that it would be handy to display it in the same web interface,
though... hmm...

</I>
You can introspect on the objects to save them to wherever :-).  I'm
sure that the registry can be contorted in order to save &quot;arbitrary&quot;
Python objects.

&gt;<i> Say, is there anyway to do &quot;offline&quot; editing of the configuration held in a 
</I>&gt;<i> tap?
</I>
Well, the existing coil code can edit &quot;offline&quot; as well as &quot;online&quot;
configurations; it just takes an Application object and mutates it. 
Adding some buttons to the interface to save / load the app to a
particular file should be trivial.
