Of course :)

I'm thinking I can find some good uses for it at work.  It is currently 
geared towards configuration (and that's something I've got alot of use for),
but what I think I have the most immediate use for is status reporting -- 
statistics like &quot;served n requests&quot;, &quot;been running since&quot;, &quot;last packet from
upstream data feed arrived at ... and had a timestamp of ...&quot;.

The sort of configuration I'd want to do is basically what you appear to 
already have -- start component X listening on port 1234, and connect it to 
upstream server Y on 9876.  I possibly also want to save configuration to 
the registry rather than to taps, but I think taps are a better idea.

Say, is there anyway to do &quot;offline&quot; editing of the configuration held in a 
tap?

-Andrew.
