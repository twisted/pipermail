<PRE>(If this doesn't make sense, you can probably ignore it. At some point 
we might make a twisted-dev list.)

Issues:

1) The problem where you click on a virtual host's sub-Resource in web 
coil and you can't configure it. Dunno why. (I fixed some similar effect 
bugs which were caused by *someone* using MOVED_PERMANENTLY and ignoring 
the fact this gets cached by browsers, but that's not the issue here.)

2) The UI assumes entities in a collection are mutable, i.e. first 
created, and then separately configured via a Configurator. This 
conflicts with stuff like making a Collection for configuring a mapping 
of strings (e.g. the mime types mapping in static.File). Possible 
solution is a custom Collection class for these situations that gets its 
own web coil UI.

3) Collections of Configurators or of configurables? I would think that 
they should stay the way they are  -- collections of configurables. It's 
easy to wrap an object coming from a collection - that's what is done 
now. And it's easier to code the Collection this way, esp. since the 
configurable classes can be collections too, in cases where it makes 
sense (e.g. web.resource.Resource.)

In most situations of course the Collections would only be coded in the 
coil plugin, but it's useful to be able to have the configurable class 
be a Collection.


What were your issues, glyph?
