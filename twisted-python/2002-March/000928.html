Thanks for your feedback.

The real problem here is that Windows isn't very command-line centric,
so there's no clear way to do this.  The UNIX procedure is to put bin/*
in /usr/bin/ using your package manager (debian's &quot;apt&quot;, for example).

What we need is a win32 equivalent to the bin/* scripts -- probably a
few .pyw files with trivial GUIs on them.  Renaming these to e.g.
twistd.py would cause several problems -- 1, twistd (et. al.) is not a
python module and should not be importable with 'import'; 2, these
scripts would apparently do nothing when invoked in Windows, unless you
have them bring up a terminal window -- in which case they will do
nothing but briefly flash a help message in a terminal window which will
disappear.

Rather than documenting the current state of affairs for win32 users, we
ought to make things work in an appropriately windows-y way instead of
relying on the fact that (some of) the stuff in bin/ just happens to run
on Windows.  Part of this Windows-centric experience of Twisted involves
COIL being fully functional, which it is not yet; that's why we haven't
started polishing up the distribution.  Soon though :-)

&gt;<i> 3 im (Tk) fails to save config state, if HOME is not set, since the ~ 
</I>&gt;<i> will return exactly, and this is an invalid filename charcter under 
</I>&gt;<i> Win9x. Either split it to check, or put in an error/warning.
</I>
Thanks for the fix -- Paul, any comments? :-)
