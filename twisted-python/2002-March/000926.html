This is excellent! A few of us are interested in doing a mail client as
well. ^.^

Oh, the mailling lists here is absolutely fine. Also, if you want to get
in contact with any of us in real-time, most of the developers hang out
on the #Python and #Twisted channels on the irc.openprojects.net IRC
network. Drop by and have a chat! (or have you already been there, and I
didn't realize you were? ^.^)
