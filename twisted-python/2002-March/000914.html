mail server (twistedmatrix.com) went down for a bit.)

 Some silliness is OK at the module naming level (see twisted.spread...)
 but when choosing class names, be as precise as possible.  Write code
 with a dictionary and thesaurus open on the table next to you.

At least 'spread' and 'pb' are sane names -- spread is a toolkit for
spreadable computing (as opposed to distributed computing, which we make
the dinction with because spreadable is translucent as opposed to
transparent), and we have PerspectiveBroker which is.. a broker for
Perspectives (which were named with the rule of clarity and conciseness
in mind -- in fact, Glyph spent an obscene amount of time coming up with
this name). :-) I'm only saying all this because I think disliking the
name is pretty irrelevant when it comes to code ;-) Anyway, see below,
not *all* of this message is a troll ;-)

&gt;<i> 	Also, twisted.spread could easily be confused with the &quot;Spread&quot; C
</I>&gt;<i> library, which is also designed for use in distributed systems.  It has a
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat different purpose, but my first thought was that twisted.spread
</I>&gt;<i> was a Python interface to the Spread library (which would be really useful
</I>&gt;<i> for Twisted, by the way).  See <A HREF="http://www.spread.org/.">http://www.spread.org/.</A>

Well, there's not much we can do about this but try to make it clear
that it's not in the documentation/website (which we do).

&gt;<i> -&gt; This technology is not optimized at the level of Quake or Tribes style
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; protocols, but it is infinitely more flexible and provide a much higher
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; level of functionality.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Unfortunately, most people _HATE_ a laggy gaming experience (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> see the &quot;Damn Lag&quot; T-Shirt at ThinkGeek.com).  For my application, the
</I>&gt;<i> need for efficiency outweighs the other features of twisted.spread.
</I>
You might want to take a closer look at the banana protocol. It was
definitely implemented with efficiency and extensibility in mind. My
point is, a UDP alternative for it would be very cool, especially if we
could integrate it higher-level abstraction, like a subset of/something
similar to PB, for example (this would an interesting challenge to think
about). The biggest problem here is CPU-time that banana/jelly take up
-- but this problem is being targetted, especially with dash's work on
twisted.eco. :-)
