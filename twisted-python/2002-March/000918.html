You're far from out of line, sir :-)

Oh, you'll probably be hearing more about Twisted in the coming
months.... muwahahaha!

&gt;<i> Ah, well. I hope I'm wrong, because I'd love both to use this stuff, and

</I>
This is great! We would love your help. Documentation and win32 support
are two things that need focus. More heads working on these would be a
_very_ good thing :-)

&gt;<i> My first try to do more than babble, will be a suggestion I couldn't find

</I>&gt;<i> /usr/lib/python2.1/site-packages/twisted, but there's no twisted.pth file

</I>
You shouldn't need a .pth file, here. You're supposed to qualify all
packages inside the 'twisted' package. That is, rather than doing
&quot;import internet&quot;, you do &quot;from twisted import internet&quot; or &quot;import
twisted.internet&quot;.

So anyway, what sorts of projects are you interested in doing with
Twisted?
