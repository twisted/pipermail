Hmmm.. Is there a particular reason you need CGI? If you don't need it
to work on multiple web servers, i'd just go with Twisted Web's Widgets,
again. It's a really nice API for developing web applications.

&gt;<i> pages for every post.  Compile indexes of the posts at regular

Yup. Twisted's mail support is finally getting there, and we do
integrate with RDBMs with twisted.enterprise.
