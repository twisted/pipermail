IDL was more elegant.

IMNSHO, these capabilities are okay, but very overrated.  Stub and
skeleton code is usually pretty trivial, and could be auto-generated
using much simpler, more natural, and better-supported approaches
than WSDL.  Seen any WSDL tools lately?  Me neither.

&gt;&gt;<i>If pure request-response with just basic types is all you need, then 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>either will work fine.  (So will SOAP, or CORBA for that matter if 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>firewalls don't preclude it -- there'll just be more docs to read.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Both SOAP and CORBA allow you to define complex objects to be marshalled

</I>&gt;<i> to simple request-response.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With CORBA the remote end can get a stub (object reference) that they can
</I>&gt;<i> call remote methods on (callbacks). Object references can be passed back
</I>&gt;<i> and forth all over the place, and the stub knows where to send the
</I>&gt;<i> callback requests to find the original implementation of that object.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SOAP is value-object (structured data, no methods) only.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I can tell, PB is a python-only equivalent to CORBA.
</I>
Not exactly, but I'll let the more PB-savvy types respond to this.
Maybe Brian?  ;)  A very important distinction is that PB is, by
design, not &quot;transparent&quot;, as CORBA tries to be.  One reason for
this is that quite often it's important for your application to
know what's remote and what's local.

But hey, RTFM -- the PB howtos are pretty good, methinks!  ;)
