I have a somewhat annoying problem related to the process code,
though possibly not caused by it. I have a script that is managing large
numbers of processes (sometimes hundreds, over time) and occasionally a
process will manage to exit and twisted's process code doesn't get the
waitpid info for it, but instead gets the ECHILD (no such child) system
error. In that case, twisted will keep trying to reap the process and
will never figure out the process is gone.

This is on a Redhat 7.2 system using python2.3 and a newish version
of twisted. I don't know why the process seems to get lost, but it
would be nice if Twisted would at least notice the ECHILD and signal
process termination (or lost, or something).

Has anyone else experienced this problem?

thanks,
dave
