<PRE>I have a few legacy simple Python modules that run on a machine that doesn't 
give me access to a crontab (I know, this sounds kind of dumb but 
unfortunately this is the policy of this a shared account that I have no 
choice but to use). With these legacy modules I have to run two (extrnal, 
non-Python) programs periodically (thus, similar to a cron) and also 
sequentially (I.e., when program A finishes, run program B) and thus 
blocking is required. To do this I've been using Python's popen3() -- and it 
has worked fine. There is an old saying: &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot; 
However, I'm tempted to re-think these modules by perhaps using the Twisted 
reactor because it has all of these other nice benefits such as provisioning 
daemonization.

I realize that Twisted's core strength is for network programming of 
asynchronous non-blocking apps and perhaps I might be better off sticking 
with my popen's instead? Any suggestions from the Twisted veterans?
