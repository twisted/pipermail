</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> name change: setParamaters()

setParameter() sans the 's'. One call per parameter

&gt;<i> &gt; .endAnswer() --&gt; the &quot;application&quot; promises that no methods of the object
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                  will be called between a series of .getAnswer()s and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                  .endAnswer(). So, this means that if the UI got a bunch 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                  of answers, it will call .getAnswer() several times, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                  then .endAnswer(). The UI will *check* for this method's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                  existance, and will not call it if it doesn't exist.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> name change: i'm not sure what, but endAnswer doesn't sound right.
</I>&gt;<i> What this is for is deferred calculation of answers. the not-calling-methods
</I>&gt;<i> thing needs to be thought about, so we don't have some weird bugs where TPy
</I>&gt;<i> goes completely haywire while configuring. (For instance, what if we're
</I>&gt;<i> configuring a web server through the web interface?)
</I>
That's the classical example for why it's needed. Since the UI should
do something like that

for parameter in stuff_i_got:
    object.setParameter(...)
object.endParameters()

Then everything is fine.
That's a classical case of &quot;if there's a doubt, there isn't a doubt&quot;: if the
UI is *not* sure it won't call other methods, it *should* call .endParameters()
It is *not* promised that there won't be multiple batches -- that's a QoI
issue.

&gt;<i> name change: [from .hasAnswer to] hasValue()?
</I>
Yep, definitely

&gt;<i> &gt; Objects which can be created by the UI should have an __init__ which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can be called without arguments. If there is any initialization which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requires arguments, it should be done in endAnswer(). The UI also promises
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not to call .endAnswer() for an object if there any questions which have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not been answered and do not have a default (.hasAnswer is false.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, instead of __init__s that don't take arguments, we have klass.getInitArgs()
</I>&gt;<i> that is another set of questions that the user answers before the UI
</I>&gt;<i> instantiates the object (well, it'll have to be klass.__dict__['getInitArgs'](),
</I>&gt;<i> as glyph pointed out to me). 
</I>
No, we won't.
We'll have copy.copy(klass.initParameters). No need to make it a callable,
really.

&gt;<i> Also, when we instantiate the object, we call
</I>&gt;<i> newObject.setParent(parent), as moshe talks about in the open questions at
</I>&gt;<i> the bottom of his mail.
</I>
&gt;<i> name change for all of the following: *Parameter
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; class BooleanQuestion:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; class IntQuestion: (can have .min and .max)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; class FloatQuestion:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; class StringQuestion: (can have .maxlength)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; class LongStringQuestion: (same as above -- it's a hint to the ui)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; class InterfaceQuestion: (specify interface, valid answers are objects)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; class ArrayQuestion: (an array of the same kind of question)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> moshe told me this was a thinko, so forget about array of questions :)
</I>
I misunderstood radix. Let me clarify:
It's something like if you want to have a set of Servers in a selector:

ArrayParameter(InterfaceParameter(ServerInterface))

&gt;<i> &gt; class DictQuestion: (a dictionary mapping strings -&gt; same kind of question)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really get this one.
</I>
Think of a web Resource which is a folder.

Then you can have

{'children': DictParameter(InterfaceParameter(WebResourceInterface)) }

[re __implements__]
&gt;<i> I seem to remember some standardization of this that was proposed in a PEP.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we should use that standard for now, but of course just use our own
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of the implementation-checking stuff. (tongue twister, eh?)
</I>
Python will not have *any* implementation of interface checking stuff.
Of course, we'll just take objects up on their __implements__ word,
not check through methods.

&gt;<i> &gt; * How do we allow the object to signify groupings of questions?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Suggestion: this means the design is bad -- break down the object
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   into smaller objects
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure of my stance on this. I'll try to think of some examples and
</I>&gt;<i> discuss.
</I> 
I myself have misgivings on that. But maybe we can punt on it for now?
