<PRE>On Sat, 12 May 2001, Glyph Lefkowitz &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">glyph at twistedmatrix.com</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i> IMHO, people *should* inherit from it, so that we can have some visibility on

No, people should put it in the __implements__ attribute.

&gt;<i> In my humble (but correct) opinion, it is *always* bad API design to force 
</I>&gt;<i> the caller to &quot;promise&quot; something.  (Sometimes, other design concerns 
</I>&gt;<i> mitigate this decision, but I don't see one here.  However, I have frequently 
</I>&gt;<i> joked about having a neon sign in my office, for design discussions, that

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would much rather see a .getParameters() -&gt; dict / .setParameters(dict).  
</I>&gt;<i> It seems more symmetrical, and if you can &quot;promise&quot; that (A) setParameters 
</I>&gt;<i> may be called some number of times and (B) endParameters() will *always* be 
</I>&gt;<i> called afterwards, we can put that loop into the config side of the code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any reasons why it can't be done this way?
</I>
Yes. In the usual case, where you don't need a .endParameters(), then the
code will be *much* clearer. You also missed the place where I say
&quot;.endParameters() will not be called if it doesn't exist&quot;.
See axiom 4 -- certainly

    def setParameter(self, name, value):
        setattr(self, name, value)

(which is the usual case)

Is much quicker then

    def setParameters(self, dict):
        for name, value in dict.items():
            setattr(self, name, value)

And another good reason -- this makes it much easier when doing 
application-level validation, to know what failed:

    # configuring RSA
    def setParameter(self, name, value):
        if not isPrime(value):
            raise ValueError(&quot;not prime&quot;)
        setattr(self, name, value)

&gt;<i> Another interesting open question (although not one I'm sure this code has to 
</I>&gt;<i> address) is how to get the respective configuration interfaces to represent 
</I>&gt;<i> object identity.  (e.g. I want to mount the *same* web resource on /foo, on 
</I>&gt;<i> /bar)
</I>
This code isn't the one that should address it -- this is UI's responsibility.
Take *another* look at the way Zope does it.

&gt;<i> However, I prefer the register(klass) way, both for clarity and efficiency.  
</I>&gt;<i> Explicit is better than implicit.
</I>
Indeed, I've decided I agree, for a different reason -- we do not want
spurious options for the user.

&gt;<i> Your code has a bug in it, which is a good example of why I like to actually 
</I>&gt;<i> inherit from interfaces :).  You don't define &quot;endParameters&quot;.
</I>
No it doesn't. It's permissible not to have .endParameters(), .setParent()
and .initParameters. The first two will not be called if they don't exist.

&gt;<i> One more question -- why doesn't the Configurable interface class actually do 
</I>&gt;<i> some things, like data validation? It sounds like it'd be possible 
</I>&gt;<i> (isCorrectInput method on the Parameter classes, or somesuch...)
</I>
I've thought about it, and decided against it -- since the UI needs to know
so much about the validation anyway, I prefer to putting the knowledge in
the UI. Sure, when we realized what is convinient for two UIs, we can have
some nice functions to help UIs -- but *outside* the Parameter class.
The classical example is that the UI might need to write the validation
code in JavaScript, for DHTML forms. Surely, a method written in Python
won't help...

&gt;<i> On the whole this looks like a good proposal, although I'm still not entirely 
</I>&gt;<i> sure what the final end-user experience of configuration will look like.
</I>
Well, I've already gave an example of what it would look like with the
command line. Mutatis-mutandis, we can pretty much imagine how to translate
it into web-based. Of course, many options still remain, but I don't think
I care about UIs: I've specified enough information for the UI -- now
the UIs can compete. (We can have 10 different web-based UIs, and choose
among them)
-- 
&quot;I'll be ex-DPL soon anyway so I'm        |LUKE: Is Perl better than Python?
looking for someplace else to grab power.&quot;|YODA: No...no... no. Quicker,
   -- Wichert Akkerman (on debian-private)|      easier, more seductive.
