<PRE>In this PR: <A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1461">https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1461</A>
some changes were made to the Twisted development process
for running the various linters before committing code.

I noticed that the changes in PR 1461 were not reflected
in docs on the wiki, specifically here:
<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedDevelopment">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedDevelopment</A>

which mentions tox environments that have been deleted in PR 1461.

I noticed this, when I recently tried to work on a branch from recent trunk,
and when I tried to run some of the commands on that wiki page
they didn't work, because they were deleted.

In this post-review comment:
<A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1461#issuecomment-753695414">https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1461#issuecomment-753695414</A>

I asked Thomas if he could modify the wiki to reflect the changes he made
in trunk,
but this hasn't been done yet.

My impression in the comments in PR 1461 is that Thomas and Adi want
to move all this documentation into the source tree, and delete the stuff
on the wiki?

Is this the long term plan?

Until this is fully completed, what is the correct thing to do when there
is a mismatch between
docs on the wiki, and docs in the tree?

I still refer to a lot of docs on the wiki, especially for process related
things,
so I think it would be nice if the wiki docs were kept up to date, until
the day that
they are fully deleted.
