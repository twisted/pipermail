<PRE>I am currently working on a control system for Arduino type devices using
Twisted,and have a bit of a design issue

Hello everyone!

I am currently working on a control system for Arduino type devices using
Twisted,and have a bit of a design issue

Here is how things are currently: (sorry in advance, might be a bit long)

   1. to handle different type of devices (each having a different firmware
   &amp; communication protocol ) i have a designed a &quot;driver&quot; system :
      - each driver is made of :
         - a &quot;hardware handler class&quot; : a wrapper around Twsited's
*serial* class
         with a few added helper methods
         - a custom serial protocol

2- While implementing drivers for Reprap 3d printers (also based on arduino,
also using a serial connection) with rather specific protocols (generally
containing comands like  *enqueue* point, *set* temperature etc), i have
started to wonder if i am placing the methods for handling those features
(each having specific commands) in the right place..

This all leads me to a few questions:

While all things are working right now,I am not quite sure about the &quot;good
practices&quot; as far asTwisted protocols go , but having looked through the
documentation / code of quite a few of them, it seems they tend to have
relatively few methods/keep it simple.

   - is this always the case? should the protocol *only* be used for very
   low level functions and in/out formatting and communication ?
   - certain devices i want to manage have very clearly defined protocols
   (Makerbot etc), should i consider general protocol specifications to be a
   different thing then the actual Twisted protocol classes i am creating ?

Any advice, tips and pointers are more than welcome ! Thanks in advance!
