</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Twistedchecker  has become an important part of dev process and I feel
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that the reviews for this project should be more visible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To be fair we are only just now getting down to a reasonable latency on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Twisted reviews, and it is still a fairly small audience reviewing.  This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may just lengthen the Twisted review queue :).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As commented earlier, any tickets which sits idle in the review queue
</I>&gt;<i> for more than 1 week is not reasonable for me
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some changes in twistedchecker are there to help you with general
</I>&gt;<i> review process so if we land them first future reviews might be faster
</I>&gt;<i> as you no longer have to stop and check for false positives in
</I>&gt;<i> twistedchecker builder.
</I>
Annoying issues with twistedchecker are certainly a problem, and I don't want to dissuade you from working on them, but to be honest, they have not been a significant source of blockers for me lately.  I have reviewed plenty of tickets this month &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/">http://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/</A>&gt; and twistedchecker rarely came up.  Now, granted, this is probably partly because of your other recent work, so, it's certainly valuable.

&gt;<i> I don't agree with your priority... but judging by the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> pyflakes patches took so long to land and nobody is pissed of by
</I>&gt;<i> twistedchecker I feel in minority :(
</I>&gt;<i> For me improving the infrastructure and the tools used by the
</I>&gt;<i> developers is more important than the Twisted code itself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that you are suggesting that we can build a state of
</I>&gt;<i> the art skyscraper with bamboo scaffolding and only use our bare hands
</I>&gt;<i> and later we can look into creating power tools and advanced cranes
</I>&gt;<i> and scaffolding.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we are used with the fact that you can only run static code
</I>&gt;<i> analysis on buildbot and for that you need a commit and to manually
</I>&gt;<i> trigger a build by filling a web form and wait 2 minutes for results,
</I>&gt;<i> but this is stone age :(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> pyflakes and twistedchecker should run in less than 1 second on local
</I>&gt;<i> computer. To optimize speed the checker should be smart and only check
</I>&gt;<i> the files which have changes since trunk.
</I>
Twisted should also seamlessly parallelize over multiple cores.  It should also have good operational visibility, tracing, and a clearly-documented deployment story.  It does not strike me that any of these are substantially more important than the others.  While the tools aren't great, what I have spent most of my time struggling with lately is how to document things clearly, not tool issues.

&gt;<i> ---------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I am trying to do is to convince other Twisted developers that
</I>&gt;<i> tools and infrastructure are important and they should be top
</I>&gt;<i> priority.
</I>&gt;<i> I am advocating for replacing primitive tools.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The current review process is a pain for new non-commiter
</I>&gt;<i> contributors. Read-only clone of svn, manual patches attached to trac,
</I>&gt;<i> review commend digested into a single comment, new branches created
</I>&gt;<i> for conflicting changes... etc
</I>
In my mind, the biggest tools problem is getting us onto a DVCS (which means &quot;git&quot; since git has won the DVCS wars). That means being able to deploy a testing site to make sure we haven't broken stuff, which means a Vagrantfile for braid.  I put in quite a lot of effort improving the state of our build farm earlier in the year, and ops stuff is only so rewarding, so I'm still a little burnt out on that.

If we had a DVCS though, the current conflicts on the logging branch would be easy to resolve, and as it stands they're not.  Many of the other issues you're talking about are hypothetically a big issue but this one is practically affecting progress a lot, since all of the builds are failing and multiple branches now need to be manually rebased.

&gt;<i> Developing good tools take a lot of effort... so does writing good
</I>&gt;<i> tests. Tools should be at least as important as the code or the tests
</I>&gt;<i> . In fact, tests are just a tool to help you develop code.
</I>
No argument there.  But there's plenty of testing we don't have either - fuzz testing, for example.  Our performance tests are kind of a mess, and we don't have alerting on performance regressions.  No one of these issues strikes me as obviously the #1 out there, overriding everything else that's going on with the project.

&gt;&gt;<i> So, I do have an alternate proposal - perhaps you should just announce
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes to twistedchecker on this list, and land changes to it without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> review if nobody objects within a week or so.  If you're making changes that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are time-sensitive and there is an insufficient community to participate in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reviews, then I think it's fair to say that they shouldn't be reviewed.  If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyone objects to the changes that are going in, they can always sign up to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do reviews :).  I have implicitly instituted such a process for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Twisted-umbrella projects like Imaginary and Vertex, where there are not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough active contributors to sustain development.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Beside twistedchecker there are also twisted-dev-tools and the repos
</I>&gt;<i> from twisted-infra organization.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not happy about cowboy / one man show coding. Merging a change
</I>&gt;<i> without a review as this will break things for sure.
</I>
I'd definitely prefer more participation but I can't synthesize contributors out of thin air.

&gt;<i> My alternate proposal is to try to raise awareness that good tools are
</I>&gt;<i> at least as important as good tests and have more people reviewing
</I>&gt;<i> code for tools and work on improving the tools and to consider them an
</I>&gt;<i> integral part of the development process.
</I>
I am personally unconvinced that this is what I should spend my time doing, just because I already have an already never-ending list of things to work on within Twisted, but I really, really hope you are able to convince many others.  It would certainly make my life a lot easier ;-).
