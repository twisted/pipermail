<PRE>Hi,

While trying to fix <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5999">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5999</A> I found
out about the SSHTransportAddress introduced in 12.1.

SSHTransportAddress is just an IAddress wrapping in a non-tranparent
way another IAddress.

It was introduces in #2997 which was accepted without any reason why
we need SSHTransportAddress and why SSHTransportAddress is better than
an IAddress.
I could not find any documentation describing why we need this new class.

In case I have not got this wrong, exarkun argued that we need
SSHTransportAddress in order to find out the type of transport in use
<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5999#comment:11">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5999#comment:11</A>

I find it stupid to use transport.getHost() and transport.getPeer() to
find out what transport you have rather than doing a check on the
transport itself.

# I am for this check
if IConchTransport.providedBy(someTransport):
    pass

# rather this one.
if isinstance(someTransport.getHost(), SSHTransportAddress):
    pass

I understand the need for endpoints but has somebody implemented an
endpoint which reads an SSHTransportAddress?

Am I the only one who fails to see the advantages of using
SSHTransportAddress over a normal IAddress?

Thanks!
