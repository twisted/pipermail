You *definitely* shouldn't do that. Push back on RedHat, and tell 
customers to push back on RedHat. I say this to other projects.

As mentioned, if maintaining 2.6 support is anything other than a 
trivial amount of work, then it's totally reasonable to drop it.

</I>
Well, I don't want to use Python 2.6 per-se. It's what a large number of 
the systems we run have bundled, I have no need for newer 2.7 language 
features, and thus if I can *possibly* avoid it, I don't want to 
maintain the burden of deploying another version, even less so the 
burden of packaging it. We've done that in the past, it's non-trivial 
effort.

I've no specific need for a newer Twisted right now, but I can imagine 
things that might appear - support in listenSSL for ALPN for example, or 
HTTP/2 - that we could use if they appeared.

So, it's purely speculative. I have no current specific need.

&gt;<i> dstufft - is there a PyPy EPEL?  As long as we're telling people to
</I>&gt;<i> change which Python to use, perhaps we should point them at an
</I>&gt;<i> actually good one ;).
</I>
PyPy in EPEL 6 is currently sitting at 2.0.2. I've only tried it a few 
times and had mixed results; having to use psycopg2cffi was a bit of a 
pain, and I had some pathological performance issues, but it did 
basically work.

The RHEL SCLs OTOH... After Donald's pointer I took a look at them. They 
are... not great.

[Basically, they're built to think they run in one path, but installed 
in another, and you have to run it with a wrapper script that sets up 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH, PYTHONPATH, etc.

As opposed to what you'd think, a Python 2.7 compiled and installed 
into, say, /opt/python2.7, which you can just run directly.

Sigh...]

So my &#163;0.02 is that recommending SCL for Python 2.7 on EL6 is something 
you would want to do with caution ;o)

I honestly wouldn't worry about it too much; RedHat's policies aren't 
and shouldn't be Twisted's problem. Do what's best for your development.

Cheers,
Phil
