I'm approximately -0 on this.  I don't like the idea of dumping a bunch of code into the main Twisted repo that isn't distributed along with Twisted (personally I cannot wait to get rid of the &quot;admin&quot; directory entirely), but I also see your point about the tool being a part of the process.

&gt;<i> Twistedchecker  has become an important part of dev process and I feel
</I>&gt;<i> that the reviews for this project are should be more visible.
</I>
&gt;<i> For example my PRs for twistedchecker are unreviewed on GitHub for
</I>&gt;<i> more than on mouth and there are many other reviews laying idle
</I>
To be fair we are only just now getting down to a reasonable latency on Twisted reviews, and it is still a fairly small audience reviewing.  This may just lengthen the Twisted review queue :).

So, I do have an alternate proposal - perhaps you should just announce changes to twistedchecker on this list, and land changes to it without review if nobody objects within a week or so.  If you're making changes that are time-sensitive and there is an insufficient community to participate in reviews, then I think it's fair to say that they shouldn't be reviewed.  If anyone objects to the changes that are going in, they can always sign up to do reviews :).  I have implicitly instituted such a process for Twisted-umbrella projects like Imaginary and Vertex, where there are not enough active contributors to sustain development.

&gt;<i> Maybe there is another reason why those PR are not reviewed and
</I>&gt;<i> merging twistechecker and twisted-dev-tools will not help with having
</I>&gt;<i> those PR reviewed faster but I would like to investigate this issue
</I>&gt;<i> and look for solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have also filled this ticket
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted-dev-tools/issues/11">https://github.com/twisted/twisted-dev-tools/issues/11</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that reviewing patched in less than 2 weeks is critical for
</I>&gt;<i> having an active open source project and expecting for developers to
</I>&gt;<i> send more patches.
</I>
Thanks for looking into this, and for all your work making it more pleasant to develop Twisted,
