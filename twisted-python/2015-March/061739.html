<PRE>Hi,

My usecase is this:

When all headers of an HTTP request are received I want to ask a
remote service if the
request should be accepted and what to do with it.

Before I got the response for the remote service, I don't want to
receive/read HTTP data.
The response is returned via an deferred.

The HTTP data might be a 10G file which might be rejected.. for
example due to quota limits.

Here is a gist with a short example and my quick and dirty fix:
<A HREF="https://gist.github.com/adiroiban/621efeab47662a04cb20">https://gist.github.com/adiroiban/621efeab47662a04cb20</A>

------

Do you think this is a valid use case and that  someone would be
willing to review a patch to add such a feature?

-------

I first went on a wrong path as I was calling
self.transport.pauseProducing() instead of self.pauseProducing() but
while reading the code I found this:

In http.HTTPChannel  self.transport.producerPaused is confusing as it
is always False.. and looking at the code from internet/abstract.py I
can see that it is not touched by pauseProducing() ... how should
producerPaused be used?

Is this a bug or a feature? Is there a ticket for it?

I saw that when you return a non-zero value from lineReceived() it
will stop processing the remaining data but I could not find the
documentation for this behaviour.

Should I continue searching for the documentation ? or file a ticket?


Thanks!
