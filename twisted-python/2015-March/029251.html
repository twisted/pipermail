</I>
The reason that we need this new type of address is to ensure that any code inspecting this address and attempting to construct a similar connection based upon it is not mislead into creating a transport which is not similar to the one it is indicating.

Arguably, SSHTransportAddress is missing lots of important information: is the address indicative of a client, or a server?  If a client, what hostname was specified?  If a server, what user is connected?  Two SSH connections to the same IP address / port number are not necessarily equivalent, but the current implementation of SSHTransportAddress would compare that way, which is unfortunate.

&gt;<i> In case I have not got this wrong, exarkun argued that we need

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I understand the need for endpoints but has somebody implemented an

</I>
No, and that's exactly the point - if they had written one that connects IPv4Addresses into endpoints, but not SSHTransportAddresses, they shouldn't be able to make a new connection and treat it as equivalent; it has totally different properties.

&gt;<i> Am I the only one who fails to see the advantages of using
</I>&gt;<i> SSHTransportAddress over a normal IAddress?
</I>
SSHTransportAddress is useful, but its only utility is in explicitly breaking use-cases that in fact should not work, so it's a bit user-hostile, so I can see why you'd feel it is useless.  If it were retrofitted to keep enough information to be useful in its own right, then that would be a lot better.
