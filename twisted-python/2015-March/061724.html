Objectively it seems reasonable.

Subjectively, it'll substantially inconvenience me (and others who have 
RH/CentOS 6 systems which will be in service for years more).

In the past, we've built and deployed a newer Python when this has 
happened e.g. RHEL4/5. That was a huge pain in the arse, and we don't 
intend to repeat it. Absent an EPEL package for python27, I suspect many 
people will do what we intend to do - stop updating Twisted.

Expect to see queries from people on older versions they can't update 
for some time ;o)

In all seriousness, I guess it depends on how useful this is. Being &quot;in 
line&quot; with other projects doesn't seem like a useful goal - who cares 
what Plone does? If it's useful for Twisted, then do it.
