</I>&gt;<i> Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> While trying to fix <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5999">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5999</A> I found
</I>&gt;<i> out about the SSHTransportAddress introduced in 12.1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SSHTransportAddress is just an IAddress wrapping in a non-tranparent
</I>&gt;<i> way another IAddress.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was introduces in #2997 which was accepted without any reason why
</I>&gt;<i> we need SSHTransportAddress and why SSHTransportAddress is better than
</I>&gt;<i> an IAddress.
</I>&gt;<i> I could not find any documentation describing why we need this new class.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason that we need this new type of address is to ensure that any code
</I>&gt;<i> inspecting this address and attempting to construct a similar connection
</I>&gt;<i> based upon it is not mislead into creating a transport which is not similar
</I>&gt;<i> to the one it is indicating.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Arguably, SSHTransportAddress is missing lots of important information: is
</I>&gt;<i> the address indicative of a client, or a server?  If a client, what hostname
</I>&gt;<i> was specified?  If a server, what user is connected?  Two SSH connections to
</I>&gt;<i> the same IP address / port number are not necessarily equivalent, but the
</I>&gt;<i> current implementation of SSHTransportAddress would compare that way, which
</I>&gt;<i> is unfortunate.
</I>
[snip]

&gt;<i> SSHTransportAddress is useful, but its only utility is in explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> breaking use-cases that in fact should not work, so it's a bit user-hostile,
</I>&gt;<i> so I can see why you'd feel it is useless.  If it were retrofitted to keep
</I>&gt;<i> enough information to be useful in its own right, then that would be a lot
</I>&gt;<i> better.
</I>
Thanks! Are these design notes for SSHTransportAddress documented somewhere?

I will update my changes to start making use of SSHTransportAddress.

I have created a ticket to add client/server information into the
SSHTransportAddress. I am using this as a pretext to try to improve
the documentation for SSHTransportAddress.

Again, many thanks for the comments!
