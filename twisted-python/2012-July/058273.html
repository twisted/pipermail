The logging system is already a bottleneck in some applications.  Doing 
even more work to try to make it properly thread-safe will probably slow 
it down even more.

I think it was a mistake to try to make it possible to use 
twisted.python.log free-threaded.  I think we should think about getting 
rid of this claimed feature.  Perhaps it could be replaced with a more 
explicit, probably more restricted, logging feature for non-reactor 
threads.

Unless someone can magically fix the threading issues without hurting 
performance.  Then, great, go for it.

Sure, but that's probably based on top of an asynchronous file I/O API 
that's not explicitly thread-based (but probably is thread-based in 
practice, because what other kind of asynchronous file I/O even exists).

Also, to explicitly answer Tristan's question:

    It's a bug in the Mantissa log observer.
