If my &quot;proxy&quot; you mean in the style of Python's built-in XMLRPC Proxy
class then I think that is the wrong approach for AMP - you have to have
Command signatures available ahead of time for a BINARY protocol.
Guessing just isn't any fun or even useful at all.

Static typing on the wire - yess.

&gt;<i> It assumes that the JSON provided satisfies the remote signature.

Sure.

&gt;<i> On IRC:

</I>&gt;<i> teratorn pointed out that there is a JSON schema ticket for AMP. Perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> there should also be a &quot;DiscoverSchema&quot; command?
</I> 
I've been calling that &quot;Service Discovery&quot; or &quot;Route Discovery&quot; for a while.
And yes, we should have *something* allowing AMP to complete effectively in
the &quot;webservice&quot; space (whatever that is).

The ticket for an AMP Schema is #5532
(<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5532">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5532</A>)

I would suggest extending the existing proposal with route
information. 

I'm a little bit unclear on what an AMP route is, but as I understand
it, it is basically a set of AMP Commands that are available at some
known location - useful for segregating functionality (pre-login,
post-login, user, admin, etc). Glyph, is that right?

There is some code from Divmod lying around somewhere that needs to be
looked at.

There is a ticket for AMP URLs that include route paths. #5548
(<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5548">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5548</A>)

This would be a great area for someone to come in and try and connect
these disparate threads together!
