<PRE>Hello all,

as part of my work on porting Twisted to Python 3, I have considered
using the six library[1] to help with some issues. six is basically a
compatibility library - same idea as our twisted.python.compat module.
Now, one approach is to add six as a dependency of Twisted - it is a
very small library so hardly a problem; on the other hand, it is an
additional dependency. The other approach would be to copy the
required code over to the t.p.compat module (six' license[2] is
basically &quot;do what you want with this code&quot;), but this is additional
work and we might miss out on the eventual bugfix (though there has
only been a couple since the project started). In general, I have
heard good things about six.

As a note, currently, I would need at least the reraise and exec_
functions from six; additionally, a lot of the things from the
six.moves package are useful. And, of course, there might be other
compatibility functions which I'd need, I just haven't encountered yet
(I do only use these if absolutely required, though).

What do you all think? In the end, it boils down to &quot;additional
dependency&quot; vs. &quot;less code to maintain&quot;.

Personally, I could go either way - using six makes things slightly
easier, but I could just copy over the code we need and be done with
it.
