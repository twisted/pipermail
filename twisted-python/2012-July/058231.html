<PRE>Hi,

I have some code that takes file uploads from browsers. I'm trying to write a test for it, so now I need to get Twisted to do file uploads like browsers do. I think my code (not test code) essentially works, by manually trying it with a browser. I can't get the functional test part to work.

I have reduced the problem to what I think is a SSCCE. render_POST drops into a debugger to easily inspect the received request.

Here's the code: <A HREF="https://gist.github.com/3058974">https://gist.github.com/3058974</A>

When debugging this with wireshark I found an obvious culprit: there's some random junk in front of it (3 ASCII hex digits and a CRLF) and some junk at the end (CRLF and an ASCII &quot;0&quot;, although I'm not sure if that CRLF is junk). Wireshark reports some broken TCP packets (PCAP attached). I have no idea why that happens. Packets were captured with:

    tcpdump -i lo0 -nn -s0 -w sample.pcap port 8080

and analyzed with a recent version of Wireshark (1.6.2, SVN rev 38931). The analyzed TCP stream is also attached.

If I look at the request in the debugger (request_POST *DOES* get calledâ€¦):

 - it has an empty request.args, instead of having the expected keys &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;f&quot;
 - request.content.getvalue() has the data you see in tcpdata.txt: it starts with &quot;'1e7\r\n------------&quot; even though I obviously would like it to start with just the dashes

cheers
lvh
