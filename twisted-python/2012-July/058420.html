</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Good question, I just created:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://docs.pythonpackages.com/en/latest/faq.html#how-do-package-authors-verify-the-integrity-of-packages-built-through-the-web">http://docs.pythonpackages.com/en/latest/faq.html#how-do-package-authors-verify-the-integrity-of-packages-built-through-the-web</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let me be clear:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is it possible to have any assurance that your system has faithfully built the package, and/or that your servers have not been compromised?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Also, if you're suggesting MD5 (following your link..) for anything related to security or data authenticity, then I *know* you're way off base.......)

Sorry, I think I have a problem with taking the exact text of my question,
on your wiki, and casting it to be a different question entirely. (through
no fault of your own, I'm sure)

I think I've clarified what my orignal question was meant to ask, namely how do
we trust YOU and YOUR build infrastructure, not &quot;how do we verify that the data
you're give us hasn't been damaged in transit&quot;.

If you wouldn't mind editing your wiki to reflect my clarifications, I would
very much appreciate it :)

&gt;<i> it's to clarify that whatever security is currently place 
</I>&gt;<i> with PyPI (not a lot, admittedly) still applies, for whatever that is 
</I>&gt;<i> worth (not much, apparently).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry if this is harsh - but it's intended. Without any kind of verifiable guarantee (get to work on that! :)) I don't think I could ever possibly use such a thing, and would advise against it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Getting software to end-users is a tough challenge, and I applaude your efforts to try and make it easier. A system with a single point of failure and a single point of trust just isn't feasible or desirable, imho.Administrators need to know who has final responsibility and *authority* 
</I>&gt;<i> over the software that they are consuming. If &quot;the cloud&quot; is the last 
</I>&gt;<i> link in that chain, then you have a big problem, I think.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The last link in the chain is PyPI (or a private index). The node before 
</I>&gt;<i> that is typically your laptop. I'm suggesting you make it 
</I>&gt;<i> pythonpackages.com instead.
</I> 
Clearly PyPI is inadequate. Jumping on solutions, for HARD problems that always 
require some form of cryptography to solve, is no more palettable.

And PyPI is also just a publishing platform - the packages have already been
minted by that point.

So as you suggest, the last point is the developer/release-manager, as it should
be.

I think my point is that ideally you don't want to trust anyone except the
developer/package-maintainer/release-manager.

Debian et. all solve this with signed packages. I would be happy to download
Debian packages from <A HREF="http://pythonpackages.com">http://pythonpackages.com</A> all day long :)

Debian also rely upon trusted build machines. But they are a more-or-less open
organization with open review of what goes on.

That said, I don't have a problem with people placing their trust in you. I don't
know you, and don't have any opinion on it to be honest. You're probably a good guy ;)

I would suggest working toward BEING a better PyPI mirror. Build
the infrastructure necessary for people to publish python SOURCE packages,
as they are, to PyPI, to pythonpackages.com, etc. etc. There is a lot of value
to be added there.

Build tools to make python packaging easy. On your laptop. On the cloud. Wherever.
Open SOURCE is good like that.

Eric Mangold
