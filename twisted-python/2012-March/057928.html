</I>
(actually, the &quot;UMID&quot; support consists of ignoring extra kwargs, and an
emacs macro which inserts umid=&quot;RANDOM&quot; at point. It works remarkably
well, and is a lot cheaper than having log.msg() capture the call stack
so you can figure out which copy of the otherwise-anonymous
log.msg(&quot;done&quot;) calls was invoked this time)

&gt;<i> Could we perhaps get some of foolscap logging's core features into
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted? We could have an AMP interface for subscribing to log streams
</I>&gt;<i> that would be slightly more low-fidelity (but, I would guess,
</I>&gt;<i> higher-performance) than the Foolscap one, but work based on the same
</I>&gt;<i> core mechanism which foolscap could then subscribe to.
</I>
Yeah, that'd be great. An AMP interface sounds lovely. I'd have to think
about potential gotchas, but I'm sure we can work them out. Foolscap's
remote protocol relies upon all the log.msg() arguments being
foolscap-serializable, which occasionally reveals places where we're
accidentally passing object instances into the log. (it uses
CopiedFailure a lot, so we'd need to come up with an AMP equivalent).
The stored-on-disk format just uses pickle, which I kinda regret, but it
should be pretty easy to replace that with something safer.

There's also the notion of a &quot;log port&quot; (a foolscap object with a
remote_subscribe() method). Does AMP have any notion of object
references? If not, I can see how you could call in and ask
(synchronously) for the current event log, but not how you'd provide a
&quot;callback object&quot; to which future events should be streamed. How does
pubsub work in AMP?

&gt;<i> I suspect that this would be useful to foolscap as well, because then
</I>&gt;<i> the code that foolscap calls into (for example, the web stuff for its
</I>&gt;<i> UIs) would be using the same logging convention.
</I>
Yeah, I'd love to get that factored out and let other people hack on it.
My web UI skills are laughable.

cheers,
 -Brian
