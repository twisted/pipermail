Yes, deferToThread() runs things in a real Python thread. If you have
code that runs very quickly, or is written in Twisted's asynchronous
style (with Deferreds), you should be fine; if you have something that
takes a while to run you should use deferToThread().

&gt;<i> 2. I understand that deferreds run &quot;later&quot;.  However, once a deferred
</I>&gt;<i> (or a deferToThread) is picked up and run, does it run from start to
</I>&gt;<i> finish?  Can it be interrupted in the middle of the function?  How
</I>&gt;<i> about its callback/errback?  Can another deferred jump in for
</I>&gt;<i> processing in between a deferred and it's callback/errback, or in the
</I>&gt;<i> middle of processing another deferred?
</I>
A Deferred can wait on the result of other Deferreds; while one Deferred
is waiting (say, waiting for a timer to go off, or waiting for network
activity), others may be running. Each individual callback/errback
function is run in its entirety, though.

&gt;<i> 3. Are there any guarantees regarding the order of execution of
</I>&gt;<i> deferreds? (I.e., are deferreds processed in the order in which they
</I>&gt;<i> are created?)
</I>
Maybe, but whenever a Deferred waits on the result of another Deferred,
you're at the mercy of whatever they're waiting for.

For example, say you use Twisted to retrieve the contents of two
web-pages:

    getPage(&quot;<A HREF="http://a.example.com&quot;">http://a.example.com&quot;</A>).addCallback(process_data)
    getPage(&quot;<A HREF="http://b.example.com&quot;">http://b.example.com&quot;</A>).addCallback(process_data)

The request for &quot;<A HREF="http://a.example.com&quot;">http://a.example.com&quot;</A> will be launched first, but if
that server takes longer to respond, process_data() might receive the
response from server B first.
	

&gt;<i> 4. Related to #2, and #3, does it make sense to use twisted when
</I>&gt;<i> requests that are serviced may depend on one another.  For example, a
</I>&gt;<i> client makes a request 'add-A' which is deferred (so that the server
</I>&gt;<i> can keep processing requests), and immediately afterwards makes a
</I>&gt;<i> request 'modify-A' (which is also run as a deferred).  Can I count on
</I>&gt;<i> add-A being done so that modify-A doesn't attempt to work on something
</I>&gt;<i> which hasn't been created yet?
</I>
In general, no. For example, if you get a request from the network that
causes you to send &quot;insert into table&quot; to the database, and meanwhile
get another request from the network that causes you to send &quot;update
table&quot; to the database, you have no way of knowing whether one will
complete before the other. Twisted's asynchronous database wrapper uses
a connection pool, so the two requests might be sent down separate
connections in parallel, so the database could actively prevent the
&quot;update&quot; from seeing the results of the &quot;insert&quot;.

If you're getting stateful requests without any kind of stateful
framing (say, 'begin transaction'/'commit transaction' messages, or some
kind of session ID, or something like that), you have a problem Twisted
cannot help with.

If you *do* have some kind of session, you can set up your server so
that you have a DeferredSemaphore per session, which will ensure that
the next Deferred until you've finished with the previous one. For
example:

    ds = DeferredSemaphore()

    def got_message(msg):
	newDefer = ds.acquire()
	newDefer.addCallback(lambda _: processMsg(msg))
	newDefer.addBoth(lambda _: ds.release())
	

&gt;<i> 5. Related to all of the above.  What If I want to modify a database
</I>&gt;<i> inside a deferred?  Is that incorrect usage?  Specifically, if all my
</I>&gt;<i> requests run as deferred, and they all start a transaction and the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning, and commit the transaction at the end, will I run into
</I>&gt;<i> problems due to context switching in the middle of deferreds? (such as
</I>&gt;<i> one request committing for both requests, starting two transactions in
</I>&gt;<i> a row, committing twice in a row, and so on.)
</I>
As somebody else mentioned, what you want is twisted.enterprise.adbapi.
It maintains a connection pool, and every database call you make
(usually via the .runQuery() or .runOperation() methods) will be run in
a separate connection, so .commit() or .rollback() will be run on the
correct connection, and you won't have problems with cross-talk between
concurrent requests.
