In principle I agree, but I'm not sure about how to do that _exactly now_.  Whereas today, immediately, all log messages could be written in the style I suggested and it would be a big improvement.

&gt;<i> Logging in the style you outlined here preserves the structure of the

</I>&gt;<i> structure is.  It seems to leave only two possibilities:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - Compare the format string to certain well-known format strings and 
</I>&gt;<i> use a match (if found) to make decisions based on a priori knowledge 
</I>&gt;<i> about the additional items in the log event.
</I>
Previous (limited) experience with internationalization efforts lead me to believe that looking at well-known format strings to determine meaning is the state of the art.

&gt;<i>  - Compare the set of keys in the log event to certain well-known sets 
</I>&gt;<i> and use a match there to make the same kind of decision.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Neither of these sounds like a good thing.
</I>
Still, a pretty substantial improvement over running a regex over a string in a quasi-structured log file after the fact (IMHO).

&gt;<i> Divmod experimented with marking log events with interfaces that 
</I>&gt;<i> documented the structure and semantics of the log event carrying them. 
</I>&gt;<i> This didn't get very far, and perhaps had problems of its own, but even 
</I>&gt;<i> it seemed preferable to either of the above options.
</I>
What I'd really like to do is to have some kind of log object built up like this:

logger = Logger(module=__name__)


class DebugFoo(logger.message()):
   &quot;&quot;&quot;wouldn't it be great if such messages were explained in detail&quot;&quot;&quot;
   audience=developers; importance=medium; format=&quot;foo %(foo)d happened&quot;;
   logID=UUID('7dc1c45b-4eb7-4a3f-b751-ee6b500f11ce')
   anythingElseInteresting=&quot;otherstuff&quot;

def onFoo(someFoo):
    DebugFoo.emit(foo=7)

and while this isn't hard to implement, it's also not implemented already, but the format= stuff is.  So my suggestion was not intended to say we should stop here, but rather, while we're figuring out better stuff to do, nobody should ever write a 'log.msg(&quot;some static &quot; + thing)' again :).
