It isn't `doRead`'s job to close the file descriptor.  At most, it's 
`doRead`'s job to signal that the descriptor is no longer worth keeping 
open by returning something like an instance of ConnectionDone or 
ConnectionLost.  Then the reactor will call connectionLost on your 
object and you can close the file descriptor there.

The documentation for how this all works could probably be improved. 
Once you figure it out, would you mind submitting a patch?

Also, you won't accomplish much by adding a file descriptor for a normal 
file to the reactor.  Select, poll, etc, will always indicate that such 
descriptors are both readable and writeable.
