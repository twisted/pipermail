<PRE>Thanks for that explanation David. Makes sense!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;From what I learned in other posts, the dataReceived(self, data): in the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will get called with out-of-order data/bytes from the client. Of course,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I could be misinformed,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but what I understood before was that in this type of Protocol, I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to re-order
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and re-assemble the bytes.  And I'm trying to avoid that, since of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; course, TCP already does it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Data being received out of order can't happen, as long as the Protocol
</I>&gt;<i> is layered on top of TCP, since as you say, TCP already provides that
</I>&gt;<i> guarantee.  The dataReceived() method is really just how the data
</I>&gt;<i> being received from TCP is handed to the Protocol object.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> UDP can be out of order, as it provides very few guarantees above and
</I>&gt;<i> beyond IP itself.  But I'm not sure you can layer an IProtocol over
</I>&gt;<i> UDP with Twisted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a general issue where you may receive the data in differently
</I>&gt;<i> sized chunks in dataReceived() than it might have been transmitted
</I>&gt;<i> originally, which is a common source of confusion to people new to
</I>&gt;<i> stream protocols, so perhaps you were thinking of that issue?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The stream nature (and possibility for early disconnect from the
</I>&gt;<i> client) is why having some internal length information for bulk
</I>&gt;<i> transfers is sensible.  For your original question, I was going to
</I>&gt;<i> suggest an older posting of mine for a similar situation where I needed
</I>&gt;<i> a bulk upload to augment a PB-based server, but it appears that you've
</I>&gt;<i> located it in the archives yourself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But like I said, I could have been misinformed because it seems pretty
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; basic to write 1,2,3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to a server and have it received 1,2,3, guaranteed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes - TCP guarantees that what you transmit at one end will be
</I>&gt;<i> received in order at the other end or not at all (e.g., outages,
</I>&gt;<i> disconnects, etc...).  It has a weaker guarantee in terms of no
</I>&gt;<i> corruption, but one that is, in combination with typical link layer
</I>&gt;<i> protections, generally more than sufficient for the vast majority of
</I>&gt;<i> connections using it each day.
