Yeah, this level of disk manipulation is past the point where a little bit less blocking on I/O will help... I imagine you've already got some kind of process/thread pooling solution already, or at least you'll need one.

No, I'm not forgetting about it: I'm just saying that once you've got an API that applications can start using that gives *some* performance benefit (non-blocking disk I/O at the expense of spinning up a few threads / processes behind the scenes), you can always optimize it for other use-cases later, without necessarily changing the API.

</I>
It would allow us to do it more portably, I think.  os.open()'s behavior can vary a lot depending on what you do with it.

&gt;<i> Reactor core was enough to sell me on twisted.  That's probably all I'll 
</I>&gt;<i> even be using.  And compared to writing my own, that's enough to be useful.

Great, glad to hear it!
