In my opinion, the right way to go about something like this would be to come up with an API for asynchronous File I/O in Twisted, implement that API using subprocesses or maybe the reactor threadpool, and then attempt to optimize and simplify it using special platform-speciifc APIs later.  (Important note: do not _expose_ the threaded nature of the code to application code at any point: just deliver the data to something in the reactor thread, to dispatch as it sees fit.)

My impression is that OS-level asynchronous file I/O APIs are fairly raw because, unlike network connectivity, you won't get thousands of connections at once.  If you only have one disk, you can only really get a benefit from two, maybe three file I/O slave processes, and that's a fairly small amount of resources to manage.  Granted, it's tricky to really identify how many &quot;disks&quot; you've got in a system, and the performance characteristics change radically based on what kind of disk technology is involved, but generally speaking a few worker threads and a queue of I/O operations would cover the vast majority of use-cases.
