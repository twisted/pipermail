</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you mean by &quot;backing up&quot;? That doesn't really make sense.   
</I>&gt;<i> When a transport &quot;backs up&quot; in Twisted, it just allocates a larger  
</I>&gt;<i> and larger buffer to store the data that is queued to be sent.
</I>I thought that the socket buffer was backing up, but now see that  
write() does buffer.  I incorrectly attributed some problems with  
data arriving out of order and/or getting lost with this... I will  
have to look deeper into what is causing these problems.  I am using  
a push producer now and the server seems to be sending things fine.   
As far as I can tell, however, the receiver is sometimes getting the  
data out of order when data comes in too fast on the client side.  I  
have to look into that and see what the cause is... maybe I am not  
being careful enough with the threads.

(On the client side, I want the user to have full access to a python  
interpreter with readline functionality etc. and the ability to plot  
things with matplotlib using Tkinter.  As far as I can see, I can't  
get readline functionality with a manhole or similar interface  
controlled by twisted, so again I have to run twisted in a separate  
thread.)

&gt;<i> And what is the &quot;lack of reactor support&quot; you're talking about?
</I>Oh, the &quot;lack of support&quot; for writeSomeData by some reactors bothered  
me and prompted me to use write;-)

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't want the computation to stop,  but think I could put an  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intermediate &quot;push producer&quot; that stops by  discarding the data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't *really* understand what you're trying to accomplish here;  
</I>&gt;<i> it soudns to me like you actually want a pull producer that just  
</I>&gt;<i> always sends the latest state in resumeProducing(), assuming it's  
</I>&gt;<i> always changing.  Of course the &quot;every 30 minutes&quot; timeframe  
</I>&gt;<i> confuses that somewhat.  However, using some kind of producer is  
</I>&gt;<i> definitely the way to go.
</I>The point here is that there are two forms of usage: one is when the  
computation is fast and the data is coming so fast that the client  
will have to drop some of it.  I agree that this should be more of a  
pull producer, but the other form of usage is where the computation  
takes about 30 minutes before new data is ready.  This should be  
implemented as a push producer.

&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a simpler way to do this all with twisted without using  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> threads? (The main goal is having an extremely minimal set of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hooks for the people writing the computational code, and having  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the computational code run as fast as possible.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could use subprocesses.  Valentino Volonghi is working on a  
</I>&gt;<i> convenient process-pool for use with Twisted: &lt;<A HREF="https://">https://</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> launchpad.net/ampoule/&gt;.  I don't think that would actually help  
</I>&gt;<i> you that much though, since you'd still need to have application-  
</I>&gt;<i> specific buffering logic (it's a slightly unusual requirement to  
</I>&gt;<i> throw away intermediary state depending on the buffer saturation).
</I>
Thanks for the suggestions and help.
Michael.
