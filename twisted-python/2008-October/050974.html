Thanks. :)

&gt;<i>Why does writeSomeData not simply raise CONNECTION_LOST as an  exception? 
</I>&gt;<i>Checking return values is quite un-pythonic.  Is there a  deep reason for 
</I>&gt;<i>this?
</I>
The reason is probably that whoever wrote it thought that raising an
exception would be enough slower than returning a special value that
it would be worth doing something slightly unusual.  Compared to
returning a value, raising an exception is expensive in CPython, but
I doubt there is any surviving benchmark which demonstrates that it
makes a difference here.

However, it's a very low-level API and since it isn't intended to be
used by application code, it doesn't seem like a very high priority
to make it less confusing.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>P.S. I came across this because I was trying to use twisted running  in a 
</I>&gt;<i>thread to write data resulting from a long computation that I  have not yet 
</I>&gt;<i>turned into a producer.  The more conventional &quot;write&quot;  method was failing 
</I>&gt;<i>if the socket backed up, and provided no simple  way of determining if data 
</I>&gt;<i>was being dropped.  My solution was to  used writeSomeData, and then have 
</I>&gt;<i>the computation decide to throw out  some of the data if it is being 
</I>&gt;<i>produced too rapidly, but I need to  know how much has been sent so I can 
</I>&gt;<i>decide what to throw away...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This seems more interesting than the main point of your email. :) You
should probably just do the work to turn the computation into a producer.
This because:

  * writeSomeData is low level and crufty, as you've discovered
  * Not all reactors have this API, so your program will break based on
    the reactor selected to run it
  * producers give you all the same information

Since you mentioned threads, I'll also point out that Twisted APIs are not
safe to use from non-reactor threads without reactor.callFromThread.  If
you aren't using callFromThread, that would explain bad behavior from the
write method.
