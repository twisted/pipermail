writeSomeData only comes first if you're looking at the documentation 
for &quot;Connection&quot;, which is itself kind of an internal thing.  The 
internals definitely aren't as cleanly separated from the public / 
application interface as they should be, but a good rule of thumb is 
that high level stuff is what's covered in the tutorial documentation. 
For example, none of 
&lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/producers.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/producers.html</A>&gt;, 
&lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/servers.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/servers.html</A>&gt;, 
or 
&lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/clients.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/clients.html</A>&gt; 
covers writeSomeData.  Another rule of thumb is that the high-level 
stuff is on explicitly specified interfaces, such as 
&lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.1.0/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.ITransport.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.1.0/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.ITransport.html</A>&gt;. 
Of course there are some low-level interfaces too, for example 
&lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.1.0/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.IWriteDescriptor.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/8.1.0/api/twisted.internet.interfaces.IWriteDescriptor.html</A>&gt; 
but their documentation is typically not as expository.

But the ultimate rule is that high-level interfaces are convenient, and 
the low-level ones (as you have noticed about writeSomeData) are not :).
&gt;<i>I know that and am using callFromThread: The reason I am having bad 
</I>&gt;<i>behavior is because the socket is backing up.  Once I put in the  logic 
</I>&gt;<i>to throw out data, it works fine... but the lack of reactor  support 
</I>&gt;<i>concerns me somewhat.
</I>
What do you mean by &quot;backing up&quot;?  That doesn't really make sense.  When 
a transport &quot;backs up&quot; in Twisted, it just allocates a larger and larger 
buffer to store the data that is queued to be sent.

And what is the &quot;lack of reactor support&quot; you're talking about?  It 
seems to me that the reactor supports everything you need.
&gt;<i>I don't want the computation to stop,  but think I could put an 
</I>&gt;<i>intermediate &quot;push producer&quot; that stops by  discarding the data.
</I>
I don't *really* understand what you're trying to accomplish here; it 
soudns to me like you actually want a pull producer that just always 
sends the latest state in resumeProducing(), assuming it's always 
changing.  Of course the &quot;every 30 minutes&quot; timeframe confuses that 
somewhat.  However, using some kind of producer is definitely the way to 
go.
&gt;<i>Is there a simpler way to do this all with twisted without using 
</I>&gt;<i>threads? (The main goal is having an extremely minimal set of hooks 
</I>&gt;<i>for the people writing the computational code, and having the 
</I>&gt;<i>computational code run as fast as possible.)
</I>
You could use subprocesses.  Valentino Volonghi is working on a 
convenient process-pool for use with Twisted: 
&lt;<A HREF="https://launchpad.net/ampoule/">https://launchpad.net/ampoule/</A>&gt;.  I don't think that would actually 
help you that much though, since you'd still need to have application- 
specific buffering logic (it's a slightly unusual requirement to throw 
away intermediary state depending on the buffer saturation).
