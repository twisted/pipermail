</I>
qt5reactor isn't particularly active and and my hope in it moving into 
the Twisted organization is that if all 'active' maintainers are lost 
and someone else volunteers later, an organizational maintainer could 
choose to give the new volunteer the necessary authority.  It may well 
be that this is a silly reason to make the move but I haven't been 
corrected about it yet.  :]

I didn't originate the 1password suggestion but if a Twisted PyPI 
account were created, as Adi mentioned, and the credentials stored in 
1password then that would associate control with the Twisted 
organization rather than individual developers.  The presently 'active' 
individual developers would presumably retain their PyPI maintainership 
rights as well.

Any more clear now?

Cheers,
