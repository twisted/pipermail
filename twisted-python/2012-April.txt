Subject: [Twisted-Python] Question : Listen to GPSD
Message-ID: <4F7B9D51.3080707@indoakses-online.com>

Dear all.

Recently, for my MDT project I use 2 twisted script.
one for the core process (XMPP, LineReceiver, SerialService), and
one for displaying msg (twisted with WxPython)
I need 2 of them .. since I cannot combine them in single script.
I Only familiar with 'service.Application' method.

Know I replace twisted+wxpython with Navit + dbus
With this method, I can display gps-things and display mysg using libnotify.

So .. currently only one twisted script needed.

The problem is : Navit use GPSD
GPSD will takeover my 'gps-port'.
This way, my twisted script can not listen to my gps-port anymore.

My question is :
Is there any way to make my twisted script to *listen* to GPSD ?

Sincerely
-bino-

Message-ID: <4F7BDADF.1040001@indoakses-online.com>

Dear all

Currently I use wokkel to bridge SerialService to my Pub/Sub system 
(currently based on Jabber XMPP)
my co-worker is PHP guys, so it's hard to get access to XMPP from PHP.
he told me about Redis, and I found txredis and TxRedisapi

I want my application basically :
1. Send whatever received via serial port to redis pubsub system, and
2. Send whatever received via redis subscribe to serial port.

Is there any example on using redis with 'twisteD application service 
framework' so that I can run it using something like :

twistd -ny ./myapp.tac -l ./myapp.log --pidfile myapp.pid

Sincerely

Subject: [Twisted-Python] defer.inlineCallbacks dosn't work with cython,
	deferredGenerator does.
Message-ID: <CABkOF6TYw8M9Np7yMR0uD0O-fn=Ofij_MxAdjw3jSDbB22=6kw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

   I just to let you know that defer.inlineCallbacks can't work with cython
well. an example:


def await():
   d = defer.Deferred()
   reactor.callLater(3, d.callback, True)
   return d

@defer.inlineCallbacks
def host():
   thing = yield await()
   ""do sth"""

will fail to work on cython due to cython would change the function
name(here I refer to host()) which lead to generator can't send back the
result to the original function.

However, deferredGenerator does work with cython

like:

@defer.deferredGenerator
def host():
    d = await()
    thing = defer.waitForDeferred(d)
    yield thing


  It is not a common case to write such codes with cython, in case of need,
deferredGenerator may help.

 I personally hope deferredGenerator will be always there even python 2.4
support has been abandoned. deferredGenerator itself is not so elegant as
inlineCallbacks, at least I don't need

to struggle with a series of callback functions..

Regards

We would like to get rid of deferredGenerator eventually; it's worse than inlineCallbacks in pretty much every way.  It sounds like you have discovered a bug though, either in Twisted, or, more likely, in Cython.  Please narrow down the bug so it can be fixed and you can start using inlineCallbacks in Cython.

For now, just keep an eye on new deferredGenerator tickets and comment on any that appear to request its removal; there's an RSS feed at <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/timeline> which may be useful to you for that.  If you put a comment on any such ticket I'm sure we can wait a while for Cython to fix the bug.

Hi Glyph

    When trying to run inlineCallbacks with Cython, a TypeError would come
out like:

TypeError: inlineCallbacks requires <built-in function test> to produce a
generator; instead got <cy3.__pyx_scope_struct__test object at 0x02808848)

test is the function where inlineCallbacks uses.

It looks like cython changes the name test to  cy3.__pyx_scope_struct__test
internally so generator can't work properly.

inlineCallbacks doesn't care what the function name is.  The problem here is
that inlineCallbacks expects to be passed a generator function[1], and instead
it is being passed some other sort of object.  The ugly cy3.__blah name is a red
herring.

-Andrew.

[1] Without the check that produces this error, a common and very confusing
    error is to decorate a non-generator function (i.e. one with no yield
    statement) with @inlineCallbacks, which would appear to work but would then
    mysteriously fail to do anything useful when executed.

Aah, I see.  So Twisted's check is a bit overzealous in the context of Cython.

Could you perhaps wrap the Cython pseudo-generator in a function that converts it into something like a real Python generator, or disable the warning and see if it works as expected?  PEP 380 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/> does have some code which one might use to do general-purpose iterator-to-generator conversion.

In any case, please file a bug.  Search the tracker for duplicates first, of course, but there don't appear to be any.  There is some precedent for fixing this type of error, too: <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3132> was somewhat similar.

Hi Andrew
   Thanks for replying. the yield was actually there:  test function is:

def await(seconds):
    d = defer.Deferred()
    reactor.callLater(seconds, d.callback, True)
    return d

@defer.inlineCallbacks
def test():
   thing = yield await(2)
   print "hey"

  Do you have any idea how to work around? Thanks

Regards

Subject: [Twisted-Python] question : SerialService and an autostart
 application of autologin user, strange behaviour
Message-ID: <4F83D4B0.5050002@indoakses-online.com>

Dear All ..

My system is an ubuntu box with openbox and Slim.

in my tac file with a SerialService, I have this line

serial = SerialPort(ArduinoReceiver(), '/dev/arduino', 
reactor,baudrate=4800)

This tac file always run well when I start it manualy from xterm.
I call it using an sh script :

--> startcore.sh &

#!/bin/bash
twistd -ny /opt/sikat/scripts/core11.tac -l 
/opt/sikat/scripts/core11.log --pidfile /opt/sikat/scripts/core11.pid


Next ... I try to call that script from my openbox autostart.sh 
(/home/sikat/.config/autostart.sh) :
/opt/sikat/scripts/startcore.sh &
/opt/sikat/bin/navit &

This way I want that whenever the system is booted,
'sikat' is autologed in by slim, and
my twistd tac script is started by openbox's autostart

THe result is :
1. twistd tac file is started,
2. No error log complaining about serial port, but
3. Anything send by my arduino looks like did not received by TAC script.

Kindly please tell me how to (what to look for to) fix this problem

Sincerely

The next release will support it on client side (for TCP), though 
there's no support for IPv6 DNS lookups yet.

I'm interested, but I'd like to know what's involved and over what
period of time before I sign up.

Thanks,

Helping students with design, planning and scoping, possibly doing code 
reviews if no code reviews are forthcoming, and then doing a review at 
the end."Five hours per student per week is a reasonable estimate." I 
suspect it's basically like managing an intern :)

The program runs from end of April to end of August.

The five hour estimate comes from the FAQ, and may be underestimate:

GSoC runs from May 21st - August 24th as a full-time internship. The GSoC
FAQ says to expect to spend 5 hours per week on GSoC per mentee:

If you are interested in mentoring:

1. say so here
2. create an account on
http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012 and apply to be
a mentor under the Python Software Foundation umbrella, for the Twisted

I'm interested, and have registered as 'mumak' on the linked GSoC
page. The only preference I have for project is to avoid the
"debugging UI" one like the plague.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] txws.py websocket and Python 2.4
Message-ID: <0a9b01cd18f9$f8da93d0$ea8fbb70$@com>

I do not quite know the most recent status of txws.py, whether it is being
merged to Twisted or not. 

But I noticed that it has it has two incompatibilities with Python 2.4:

1.       from hashlib import md5, sha1

2.       protocol = "wss" if self.isSecure() else "ws"

 

After fixing those, it works on 2.4.

Would it make sense to make that change on github?

Maybe you could commit that?

 

try:

    #python 2.6+

    from hashlib import md5, sha1

except ImportError:

    import md5

    from sha import sha as sha1

 

 

protocol = "self.isSecure() and wss" or "ws"

 

 

That would help to people with 2.4!

Hi

   Thanks for your info...It looks like they use twisted on the client side
mostly.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Coverage summary with trial
Message-ID: <2767461.k8T3pZtW7e@think>

Hi all,

I would like to collect coverage statistic for my twisted code with trial and 
was wondering how to achieve this.

I run something like:
	$ trial --coverage testdir/*_test.py

all tests are green and i can see coverage files in _trial_temp/coverage/.

After looking around a bit i learn that the python trace module is used under 
the hood and my assumption then is that i must use similar commands as those 
that are shown here:

http://docs.python.org/library/trace.html

I had to look at the source code to find this out. It would be nice if it was 
mentioned in the documentation somewhere.

So i try to construct a command like this:

python -m trace --summary --report --coverdir _trial_temp/coverage/

But it needs --file which seems not to be enabled by trial. I then make some 
changes in the trial script:


--- trial.py.orig       2012-03-30 06:32:08.627758872 +0200
+++ trial.py    2012-04-14 04:50:05.416382063 +0200
@@ -162,7 +162,8 @@
         directory specified by the I{trial-temp} option.
         """
         import trace
-        self.tracer = trace.Trace(count=1, trace=0)
+       countfile="countfile.txt"
+        self.tracer = trace.Trace(count=1, trace=0, infile=countfile, 
outfile=countfile)
         sys.settrace(self.tracer.globaltrace)

and i can finally see a summary if i remember to add the --missing option:

python -m trace --report --summary --missing --file countfile.txt --
coverdir=_trial_temp/coverage/

I assume i am missing something obvious, because it seems strange that one 
would have to change the trial script to achieve this. How do other people 
create such summaries?

coverage.py is  a much nicer tool: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/

You'd do "coverage.py [some arguments here] /path/to/trial mypackage",
more or less.

For example:

 $ sudo pip-2.7 install coverage
 $ cd ~/lab/txaws/trunk
 $ coverage run `which trial` ./txaws
 $ coverage report

coverage.py is great

Thanks for your answers.

I had already tried coverage this way, but it produced no output for me. After 
investigating it further, it turns out that the wrapper script gentoo 
generates for /usr/bin/trial was at fault. Using /usr/bin/trial-2.7 instead 
worked fine.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] [ANN] Announcing MV3D 0.75!
In-Reply-To: <29938393.22.1334446911042.JavaMail.root@verity>
Message-ID: <30612594.24.1334447158541.JavaMail.root@verity>

We are very happy to announce the release of version 0.75 of MV3D! This was mainly a bug-fixing release with more than 65 bugs squashed. Also, in this release, MV3D gained support for Linux with the Ogre3D renderer along with Mac OS X with the Panda3D renderer. This means that MV3D's client, server, and tools are available on Windows, Linux, and OS X! With bug-fixes across the whole platform, this is also the most stable release of MV3D to date.

MV3D is an open source multiplayer game and virtual world framework written in Python using Twisted for networking. It encompasses a scalable server with dynamic load balancing, a robust set of content creation tools, and an extensible 3D client application. MV3D provides the foundation to build anything from 3D chat rooms to full MMORPGs with the goal of letting you concentrate on creating a unique virtual world instead of the infrastructure to support it.

For more information on MV3D and this or future releases, please visit the website at http://www.mv3d.com . The full release notes for version 0.75 are available online at this URL: http://www.mv3d.com/trac/browser/tags/mv3d-0.75/release-notes.txt . For further inquiries, feel free to stop by our IRC channel on irc.freenode.net #MV3D.

Here are some screenshots of MV3D running on OS X and Linux:
http://www.mv3d.com/trac/screenshots/51
http://www.mv3d.com/trac/screenshots/52

The next release is 0.80 which is set to include features aimed at improving MV3D's usability as a platform for traditional MMORPGs such as instancing along with increasing tool usability and functionality.

Enjoy,

Mike

I'm happy to help out with the Sphinx conversion project idea, if we have
an interested student.

Has anyone shown interest in this so far?

I've created a profile and applied.

BTW, I didn't mean to say above that I would _only_ be willing to work on
the Sphinx project.  I'm happy to help out wherever I can.

Apparently documentation projects are not acceptable for Summer of Code, so... no.  Sorry.

I wonder if they might differentiate between a project working on 
documentation tool-chain code and a project working on documentation 
content itself.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] call XMLRPC
Message-ID: <CANAxZ+OBq89z7UPgxETSZLOi2K5X74LH-ZAiLERvZZRvWTH-DA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I started to learn Twisted with the O'Reilly Book Twisted Network
Programming Essentials
I want to do a daemon to listen on port
- when a correct sentence is received, the daemon must to check by querying a
server XML_RPC
- if the answer from  XML_RPC is 1, the  HTTP answer will be OK else NOT
FOUND

I adapted the basic example HttpEchoProtocol.py

from twisted.protocols import basic
from twisted.web.xmlrpc import Proxy
from twisted.internet import protocol, reactor
import pdb

KEYS_ADDR="192.168.0.254"
KEYS_PORT=2101

# URL of the XML-RPC server
 OF_XMLRPC_URL="http://127.0.0.1/xmlRpc.rpc.php"
# HTTP Port from which the OF client contact the service
SERVICE_PORT=4080
# url sent  for test: localhost:4080/?sessid=dddddd&key=1&resource=2

class HttpProtocol(basic.LineReceiver):

    def __init__(self):
        self.lines      = []
        self.answer     = "HTTP/1.0 200 No value"
        self.gotRequest = False
        self.proxy      = Proxy(OF_XMLRPC_URL)

    def xmlRpcResponse(self, value):
        self.xmlRpc = value
        if self.xmlRpc == 1:
            self.answer = "HTTP/1.0 200 OK"
            print "xmlRpc : ",self.xmlRpc
        else:
            self.answer = "HTTP/1.0 406 Invalid key"
        self.xmlRpc = 0

    def xmlRpcError(self, error):
        self.answer = "HTTP/1.0 405 NOT FOUND"
        print "Error"

    def lineReceived(self, line):
        self.lines.append(line)
        if not line and not self.gotRequest:
            text = self.lines[0]
            startText = text.find("sessid")
            if startText>0 :
                endText = text.find("HTTP")
                text=text[startText:endText]
                data = text.split("&")
                sessionId = data[0][data[0].find("=")+1:]
                keyId = int(data[1][data[1].find("=")+1:])
                resourceId = int(data[2][data[2].find("=")+1:])
                self.proxy.callRemote('checkCommand', sessionId,
keyId).addCallbacks(self.xmlRpcResponse, self.xmlRpcError)
            self.sendResponse()
            self.gotRequest = True

    def sendResponse(self):
        responseBody = self.answer
        self.sendLine(self.answer)
        self.sendLine("Content-Type: text/plain")
        self.sendLine("Content-Length: %i" % len(responseBody))
        self.sendLine("")
        self.transport.write(responseBody)
        self.transport.loseConnection()

factory = protocol.ServerFactory()
factory.protocol = HttpProtocol
reactor.listenTCP(SERVICE_PORT, factory)
reactor.run()

XML_RPC answer is correctly  received ("xmlRpc :  1") but the HTTP answer
is always "HTTP/1.0 200 No value" (first initialization)

I tried a other example, based on requesthandler,py

from twisted.web.xmlrpc import Proxy
from twisted.web import http
from twisted.web.xmlrpc import Proxy
from twisted.internet import reactor
import pdb


# HTTP Port from which the OF client contact OpenKeys service
SERVICE_PORT=4080

# URL of the XML-RPC server
OF_XMLRPC_URL="http://127.0.0.1/openkeys.rpc.php"

class MyRequestHandler(http.Request):

    xmlRpc = 0
    def xmlRpcResponse(self, value):
        self.xmlRpc = value
        print repr(value)
        if self.xmlRpc == 1:
           self.setResponseCode(http.OK)
           self.write("<h1>OK</h1>")
        else:
            self.setResponseCode(http.NOT_ALLOWED)
            self.write("<h1>Invalid key</h1>.")
        self.xmlRpc = 0
        self.finish()

    def xmlRpcError(self, error):
        print 'error', error
        self.setResponseCode(http.NOT_FOUND)
        self.write("<h1>Not Found</h1>")
        self.xmlRpc = 0
        self.finish()

    def process(self):
        self.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html')
        data = self.args
        if 'sessid' in data:
            sessionId  = data['sessid'][0]
            keyId      = data["key"][0]
            resourceId = data["resource"][0]
            print "session = ", sessionId
            print "key = ", keyId
            print "resource = ", resourceId
            proxy.callRemote('checkCommand', sessionId,
keyId).addCallbacks(self.xmlRpcResponse, self.xmlRpcError)
        else:
            print "data = ", data
            self.setResponseCode(http.NOT_FOUND)
            self.write("<h1>Not Found</h1>Sorry, no such page.")
            self.finish()

class MyHttp(http.HTTPChannel):
    requestFactory = MyRequestHandler

class MyHttpFactory(http.HTTPFactory):
    protocol = MyHttp

proxy  = Proxy(OF_XMLRPC_URL)
reactor.listenTCP(SERVICE_PORT, MyHttpFactory())
reactor.run()

But in this case an error occur

error [Failure instance: Traceback: <class 'xmlrpclib.Fault'>: <Fault

I try to declare the Proxy(OF_XMLRPC_URL) differently, without success

Where is my mistake ....

That code is all wrong, and (to be blunt) pretty horrible too.

Why have you re-implemented a HTTP protocol yourself? You're bound to 
get this wrong (and in fact have, in several ways). Don't do this. Use 
the HTTP stack that comes with Twisted.

Anyway, your major mistake in the 1st example is that, at the end of the 
lineReceived method, you always call the sendResponse() method. This 
happens immediately, before the XMLRPC reply has come back, so your code 
sends "no value". You need to attach the sendResponse method to the 
deferred returned from the xmlrpc call.

I would junk it and start again, like this:

from twisted.web import server, resource, xmlrpc, http

proxy = xmlrpc.Proxy(XMLRPC_URL)

class MyResource(resource.Resource):
   isLeaf = True
   def render_GET(self, request):
     sessid = request.args['sessid'][0]
     keyid = request.args['keyid'][0]
     d = proxy.callRemote('checkCommand', sessid, keyid)
     d.addCallback(self._done, request)
     d.addErrback(self._err, request)
     return server.NOT_DONE_YET

   def _done(self, res, request):
     if res!=1:
       request.setResponseCode(406)
     else:
       request.setResponseCode(200)
     request.finish()

   def _err(self, failure, request):
     request.setResponseCode(405)
     request.finish()

reactor.listenTCP(8080, server.Site(MyResource()))
reactor.run()

Thank for your help

It's right, the code number 1 is not well structured that is the reason I
modified it for the code number 2
But in the first one the xml_rpc call retun the good answer and in the
second one I received a error message

I tried your code,this is a better structure (The Class Resource is in the
next example in the book)

 But the code doesn't work, I have the same error message about xml_rpc
answer

[Failure instance: Traceback: <class 'xmlrpclib.Fault'>: <Fault -32602:
'server error. invalid method parameters'>

]

The issue is how to call xml_rpc callRemote correctly ?

Thank again

That's an error from the server.  Without knowing how that server works there's
not much we can do to help you; that code will be issuing a well-formed XML-RPC
request, but we can't guess at what that particular server considers valid
method parameters.

At the least an example of an XML-RPC request that the server does accept would
help: we could then suggest how to adjust your code to emit the same request.

I'm leaving my home in the Boston metro area, and moving cross-country.  This move should take at least a couple of weeks.

I currently host buildbots for many of our supported platforms; everything with a 'bot-glyph-*' in front of it on this page: <http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/buildslaves>, and also bot-exarkun-1.  So, when I move (at the latest, 6 weeks from now) these will all go offline.

We need a volunteer who either:

lives somewhere in massachusetts and can plug these in to an ethernet port
wants to re-set-up all of these buildbots on some new hosting

The somewhat less palatable option 3 is to just let much of our build infrastructure be offline for a month.

Glyph,
What sort of resources are necessary for this box?  I'm obviously not in
MA, but could be interested in hosting on new hosting if you can't find
local resources.

Let me know,
Barry

Hi Barry,

A reasonably low-latency residential internet connection should be fine; it needs to be somewhere with a port accessible to the outside world, so a firewall configured to permit SSH traffic and some kind of DNS (dynamic DNS, of course, if it's residential) so that maintainers can SSH to it.

I don't think that's "obvious" to anybody, actually, even if there may be enough forensics in your email headers to help us figure it out :).

Thanks for volunteering.

Once I'm all moved we can just ship the box to my new address; the question is mostly about what to do in the meanwhile, so local resources are much preferred.  However, we'll keep you in mind if nobody else should volunteer.

Hello

I'm starting to learn twisted, I wanted to test the example of twisted
documentation:  finger11
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/tutorial/intro.html

Its is possible to use twistd in Windows console  ?
I tried
- twistd -y finger11.tac but twistd is not recognize
- python finger11.tac, it's run the script but stop and the prompt symbol
come back

How we can test this script ?

Thank

twistd does work on Windows, but doesn't support some features like
daemonization.

This works here:

C:\Python27\python C:\Python27\Scripts\twistd.py -y
./doc/core/howto/tutorial/listings/finger/finger11.tac

Hi

   I come up with a link about this problem
http://groups.google.com/group/cython-users/browse_thread/thread/295937ae99fdfebe/9b0872a76e0172d8#9b0872a76e0172d8

feel free to check it. Thanks

Roughly, It can be concluded that cython has a different generator
implementation so that it can't work well with inlinecallback

Regards

Yes, that is currently the case, but if someone wanted to fix the bug we'd be happy to review a patch.

How many IPs does this require? 
Is this a standard tower-type system or rack mount. 
If it is just a case of plugging it into the net, we can move that up to our office in the interim. 
However, we really don't have rack mount capability.

Standard tower.

Yeah.  We just need the one inbound port (SSH) to fix stuff if it breaks.  The actual buildbot connections are all outgoing.

If you want to drive down to Cambridge to pick it up, I'll buy you dinner while you're here :-).

Hi Glyph,

I'm probably closer to you than Ray, but he sounds like he might have a
better environment.  I'm live in Belmont, 1 block from Cambridge.  I have
FIOS (20Mb, I think, but just a single IP and no A/C.  I haven't used any
dynamic DNS service, but can't imagine it would be too hard to set up. 

...

Another possibility would be my office in Lexington.  Real (though small)
computer room, A/C, limited UPS, etc. and lots of room since we just
consolidated a bunch of servers.  We have both FIOS and ComCast business
service and (at the moment) a couple of spare IP addresses.  We can
firewall it off from everything internal so it would look like it was
sitting on the Internet all by itself.  Or we could provide DNS service
and whatever for it.

We use a fair amount of Twisted and one of my coworkers was recently
saying we should kick in something to the Twisted project.  Maybe this
is a way of doing it.  He's also the guy (currently) in charge of our
network infrastructure, so he's the one I would have to talk it over
with him, but he's on vacation this week.  Also, I'm going to NYC
tomorrow (mini-vacation) so I won't be able to talk to him about it
until late Monday or Tuesday.  It looks like you are moving in early
June at the latest, I think that might work...


A little later...

I dropped him an email, and just heard back.  It sounds fine to him, so
I'm officially making the offer...

If it is just a case of plugging it into the net, we can move that up to our
office in the interim.
However, we really don't have rack mount capability.
NH, but I figure that's close enough--:}

Hi Glyph: 
That sounds reasonable -- and a trip to Cambridge to pick it up is no problem. 
Parking, on the other hand is always an exciting prospect as I tend to drive larger vehicles 
(probably take our Sprinter Van for this trip). 

If you decide to have us do the temporary hosting I'm sure we can at least find a loading zone to pack up the systems. 
What sort of timeframe are you looking at (and we can take this off-list to exchange details).

hi

I use twisted to build some web services, using twistd to start a application.

When I start the twistd, and without any connection, the cpu usage of twistd process comes to about 10%.

I don't think it's normal. I think it should be much low than this num.

But I don't know how to find the problem is.Would anyone be pleased to help me?

Thanks.

Twisted doesn't use 10% CPU by default; chances are it's some code you 
wrote. Have you tried using a profiler (e.g. cProfile)?

How can i use cProfile with twisted?

Is there any guide or example? 

Thank you very much. I googled and stackoverflowed ,but didn't find any examples.

I was reading http://technicae.cogitat.io/2012/03/conversation-with-guido-about-callbacks.html
. I'm not done with it yet but I'm sure some of you would have already
read this. Would there be any changes required in Twisted code because

anything we can take from it that we can use to help make Twisted
better ?

I don't think so.  Most of what Guido wants is already available via inlineCallbacks, and the drawbacks of using that are documented pretty well in the comments there.  I also have some issues with the premises and conclusions of that article. For example, batching, pipelining and pooling are all easier to implement with a callback-driven style.

I think that article is mainly about aesthetic choices, and the culture of the Python community.  However, it does highlight the need to document the reasons why things are the way that they are in the Twisted world, so that the broader Python community understands that it's not weird for the sake of weird; but this is a documentation issue.  For example, Node.JS doesn't have this problem, despite having a much worse convention of callback spaghetti (as far as I know, they don't have an abstraction analogous to a Deferred yet); this is because the JavaScript community has already accepted callbacks and is intimately familiar with them before approaching Node for the first time.  There are a few analogues in Python (for example, GUI toolkit programming) but a smaller proportion of the community at large are familiar with that style.

But, if you can think of something actionable that would make Twisted better based on that blog post - or anything else, for that matter! - feel free to file a ticket.

Several large JS toolkits have the concept of a Deferred or a Promise.
MochiKit stole Twisted's, where it got forked into Dojo, and then
forked into Google's Closure library. jQuery has a separate Deferred
implementation that looks like Twisted's, and is similar enough that
we can call it a Deferred, although I know a few people who object to
that.

This is a bit off-topic, but generators are expected to be in Harmony
(they're already in Mozilla's JS, stolen wholesale from Python). The
latest specification draft has "yield" as a future reserved word, and
has a reference to an undefined "YieldExpression", though this may
just be an editing oversight.

Right now, you could implement inlineCallbacks in Mozilla JavaScript.

A few years ago, I confirmed that this actually works:

http://ludios.org/js-inlineCallbacks-POC/

(though the above is inconvenient to use because it relied on my fork
of Divmod's JS).

I think there has been similar work in the node.js world.  I recall
some node.js forks that run on SpiderMonkey just so that they can use
its `yield`.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Question : Listen to GPSD
Message-ID: <4F7B9D51.3080707@indoakses-online.com>

Dear all.

Recently, for my MDT project I use 2 twisted script.
one for the core process (XMPP, LineReceiver, SerialService), and
one for displaying msg (twisted with WxPython)
I need 2 of them .. since I cannot combine them in single script.
I Only familiar with 'service.Application' method.

Know I replace twisted+wxpython with Navit + dbus
With this method, I can display gps-things and display mysg using libnotify.

So .. currently only one twisted script needed.

The problem is : Navit use GPSD
GPSD will takeover my 'gps-port'.
This way, my twisted script can not listen to my gps-port anymore.

My question is :
Is there any way to make my twisted script to *listen* to GPSD ?

Sincerely
-bino-

Subject: [Twisted-Python] question : redis and twisteD application service
	framework
Message-ID: <4F7BDADF.1040001@indoakses-online.com>

Dear all

Currently I use wokkel to bridge SerialService to my Pub/Sub system 
(currently based on Jabber XMPP)
my co-worker is PHP guys, so it's hard to get access to XMPP from PHP.
he told me about Redis, and I found txredis and TxRedisapi

I want my application basically :
1. Send whatever received via serial port to redis pubsub system, and
2. Send whatever received via redis subscribe to serial port.

Is there any example on using redis with 'twisteD application service 
framework' so that I can run it using something like :

twistd -ny ./myapp.tac -l ./myapp.log --pidfile myapp.pid

Sincerely

Subject: [Twisted-Python] defer.inlineCallbacks dosn't work with cython,
	deferredGenerator does.
Message-ID: <CABkOF6TYw8M9Np7yMR0uD0O-fn=Ofij_MxAdjw3jSDbB22=6kw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

   I just to let you know that defer.inlineCallbacks can't work with cython
well. an example:


def await():
   d = defer.Deferred()
   reactor.callLater(3, d.callback, True)
   return d

@defer.inlineCallbacks
def host():
   thing = yield await()
   ""do sth"""

will fail to work on cython due to cython would change the function
name(here I refer to host()) which lead to generator can't send back the
result to the original function.

However, deferredGenerator does work with cython

like:

@defer.deferredGenerator
def host():
    d = await()
    thing = defer.waitForDeferred(d)
    yield thing


  It is not a common case to write such codes with cython, in case of need,
deferredGenerator may help.

 I personally hope deferredGenerator will be always there even python 2.4
support has been abandoned. deferredGenerator itself is not so elegant as
inlineCallbacks, at least I don't need

to struggle with a series of callback functions..

Regards

We would like to get rid of deferredGenerator eventually; it's worse than inlineCallbacks in pretty much every way.  It sounds like you have discovered a bug though, either in Twisted, or, more likely, in Cython.  Please narrow down the bug so it can be fixed and you can start using inlineCallbacks in Cython.

For now, just keep an eye on new deferredGenerator tickets and comment on any that appear to request its removal; there's an RSS feed at <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/timeline> which may be useful to you for that.  If you put a comment on any such ticket I'm sure we can wait a while for Cython to fix the bug.

Hi Glyph

    When trying to run inlineCallbacks with Cython, a TypeError would come
out like:

TypeError: inlineCallbacks requires <built-in function test> to produce a
generator; instead got <cy3.__pyx_scope_struct__test object at 0x02808848)

test is the function where inlineCallbacks uses.

It looks like cython changes the name test to  cy3.__pyx_scope_struct__test
internally so generator can't work properly.

inlineCallbacks doesn't care what the function name is.  The problem here is
that inlineCallbacks expects to be passed a generator function[1], and instead
it is being passed some other sort of object.  The ugly cy3.__blah name is a red
herring.

-Andrew.

[1] Without the check that produces this error, a common and very confusing
    error is to decorate a non-generator function (i.e. one with no yield
    statement) with @inlineCallbacks, which would appear to work but would then
    mysteriously fail to do anything useful when executed.

Aah, I see.  So Twisted's check is a bit overzealous in the context of Cython.

Could you perhaps wrap the Cython pseudo-generator in a function that converts it into something like a real Python generator, or disable the warning and see if it works as expected?  PEP 380 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0380/> does have some code which one might use to do general-purpose iterator-to-generator conversion.

In any case, please file a bug.  Search the tracker for duplicates first, of course, but there don't appear to be any.  There is some precedent for fixing this type of error, too: <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3132> was somewhat similar.

Hi Andrew
   Thanks for replying. the yield was actually there:  test function is:

def await(seconds):
    d = defer.Deferred()
    reactor.callLater(seconds, d.callback, True)
    return d

@defer.inlineCallbacks
def test():
   thing = yield await(2)
   print "hey"

  Do you have any idea how to work around? Thanks

Regards

Subject: [Twisted-Python] question : SerialService and an autostart
 application of autologin user, strange behaviour
Message-ID: <4F83D4B0.5050002@indoakses-online.com>

Dear All ..

My system is an ubuntu box with openbox and Slim.

in my tac file with a SerialService, I have this line

serial = SerialPort(ArduinoReceiver(), '/dev/arduino', 
reactor,baudrate=4800)

This tac file always run well when I start it manualy from xterm.
I call it using an sh script :

--> startcore.sh &

#!/bin/bash
twistd -ny /opt/sikat/scripts/core11.tac -l 
/opt/sikat/scripts/core11.log --pidfile /opt/sikat/scripts/core11.pid


Next ... I try to call that script from my openbox autostart.sh 
(/home/sikat/.config/autostart.sh) :
/opt/sikat/scripts/startcore.sh &
/opt/sikat/bin/navit &

This way I want that whenever the system is booted,
'sikat' is autologed in by slim, and
my twistd tac script is started by openbox's autostart

THe result is :
1. twistd tac file is started,
2. No error log complaining about serial port, but
3. Anything send by my arduino looks like did not received by TAC script.

Kindly please tell me how to (what to look for to) fix this problem

Sincerely

The next release will support it on client side (for TCP), though 
there's no support for IPv6 DNS lookups yet.

Helping students with design, planning and scoping, possibly doing code 
reviews if no code reviews are forthcoming, and then doing a review at 
the end."Five hours per student per week is a reasonable estimate." I 
suspect it's basically like managing an intern :)

The program runs from end of April to end of August.

The five hour estimate comes from the FAQ, and may be underestimate:

I'm interested, and have registered as 'mumak' on the linked GSoC
page. The only preference I have for project is to avoid the
"debugging UI" one like the plague.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] txws.py websocket and Python 2.4
Message-ID: <0a9b01cd18f9$f8da93d0$ea8fbb70$@com>

I do not quite know the most recent status of txws.py, whether it is being
merged to Twisted or not. 

But I noticed that it has it has two incompatibilities with Python 2.4:

1.       from hashlib import md5, sha1

2.       protocol = "wss" if self.isSecure() else "ws"

 

After fixing those, it works on 2.4.

Would it make sense to make that change on github?

Maybe you could commit that?

 

try:

    #python 2.6+

    from hashlib import md5, sha1

except ImportError:

    import md5

    from sha import sha as sha1

 

 

protocol = "self.isSecure() and wss" or "ws"

 

 

That would help to people with 2.4!

Hi

   Thanks for your info...It looks like they use twisted on the client side
mostly.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Coverage summary with trial
Message-ID: <2767461.k8T3pZtW7e@think>

Hi all,

I would like to collect coverage statistic for my twisted code with trial and 
was wondering how to achieve this.

I run something like:
	$ trial --coverage testdir/*_test.py

all tests are green and i can see coverage files in _trial_temp/coverage/.

After looking around a bit i learn that the python trace module is used under 
the hood and my assumption then is that i must use similar commands as those 
that are shown here:

http://docs.python.org/library/trace.html

I had to look at the source code to find this out. It would be nice if it was 
mentioned in the documentation somewhere.

So i try to construct a command like this:

python -m trace --summary --report --coverdir _trial_temp/coverage/

But it needs --file which seems not to be enabled by trial. I then make some 
changes in the trial script:


--- trial.py.orig       2012-03-30 06:32:08.627758872 +0200
+++ trial.py    2012-04-14 04:50:05.416382063 +0200
@@ -162,7 +162,8 @@
         directory specified by the I{trial-temp} option.
         """
         import trace
-        self.tracer = trace.Trace(count=1, trace=0)
+       countfile="countfile.txt"
+        self.tracer = trace.Trace(count=1, trace=0, infile=countfile, 
outfile=countfile)
         sys.settrace(self.tracer.globaltrace)

and i can finally see a summary if i remember to add the --missing option:

python -m trace --report --summary --missing --file countfile.txt --
coverdir=_trial_temp/coverage/

I assume i am missing something obvious, because it seems strange that one 
would have to change the trial script to achieve this. How do other people 
create such summaries?

coverage.py is  a much nicer tool: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/

You'd do "coverage.py [some arguments here] /path/to/trial mypackage",
more or less.

For example:

 $ sudo pip-2.7 install coverage
 $ cd ~/lab/txaws/trunk
 $ coverage run `which trial` ./txaws
 $ coverage report

Thanks for your answers.

I had already tried coverage this way, but it produced no output for me. After 
investigating it further, it turns out that the wrapper script gentoo 
generates for /usr/bin/trial was at fault. Using /usr/bin/trial-2.7 instead 
worked fine.

Message-ID: <30612594.24.1334447158541.JavaMail.root@verity>

We are very happy to announce the release of version 0.75 of MV3D! This was mainly a bug-fixing release with more than 65 bugs squashed. Also, in this release, MV3D gained support for Linux with the Ogre3D renderer along with Mac OS X with the Panda3D renderer. This means that MV3D's client, server, and tools are available on Windows, Linux, and OS X! With bug-fixes across the whole platform, this is also the most stable release of MV3D to date.

MV3D is an open source multiplayer game and virtual world framework written in Python using Twisted for networking. It encompasses a scalable server with dynamic load balancing, a robust set of content creation tools, and an extensible 3D client application. MV3D provides the foundation to build anything from 3D chat rooms to full MMORPGs with the goal of letting you concentrate on creating a unique virtual world instead of the infrastructure to support it.

For more information on MV3D and this or future releases, please visit the website at http://www.mv3d.com . The full release notes for version 0.75 are available online at this URL: http://www.mv3d.com/trac/browser/tags/mv3d-0.75/release-notes.txt . For further inquiries, feel free to stop by our IRC channel on irc.freenode.net #MV3D.

Here are some screenshots of MV3D running on OS X and Linux:
http://www.mv3d.com/trac/screenshots/51
http://www.mv3d.com/trac/screenshots/52

The next release is 0.80 which is set to include features aimed at improving MV3D's usability as a platform for traditional MMORPGs such as instancing along with increasing tool usability and functionality.

Enjoy,

Mike

I'm happy to help out with the Sphinx conversion project idea, if we have
an interested student.

Has anyone shown interest in this so far?

I've created a profile and applied.

BTW, I didn't mean to say above that I would _only_ be willing to work on
the Sphinx project.  I'm happy to help out wherever I can.

Apparently documentation projects are not acceptable for Summer of Code, so... no.  Sorry.

I wonder if they might differentiate between a project working on 
documentation tool-chain code and a project working on documentation 
content itself.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] call XMLRPC
Message-ID: <CANAxZ+OBq89z7UPgxETSZLOi2K5X74LH-ZAiLERvZZRvWTH-DA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I started to learn Twisted with the O'Reilly Book Twisted Network
Programming Essentials
I want to do a daemon to listen on port
- when a correct sentence is received, the daemon must to check by querying a
server XML_RPC
- if the answer from  XML_RPC is 1, the  HTTP answer will be OK else NOT
FOUND

I adapted the basic example HttpEchoProtocol.py

from twisted.protocols import basic
from twisted.web.xmlrpc import Proxy
from twisted.internet import protocol, reactor
import pdb

KEYS_ADDR="192.168.0.254"
KEYS_PORT=2101

# URL of the XML-RPC server
 OF_XMLRPC_URL="http://127.0.0.1/xmlRpc.rpc.php"
# HTTP Port from which the OF client contact the service
SERVICE_PORT=4080
# url sent  for test: localhost:4080/?sessid=dddddd&key=1&resource=2

class HttpProtocol(basic.LineReceiver):

    def __init__(self):
        self.lines      = []
        self.answer     = "HTTP/1.0 200 No value"
        self.gotRequest = False
        self.proxy      = Proxy(OF_XMLRPC_URL)

    def xmlRpcResponse(self, value):
        self.xmlRpc = value
        if self.xmlRpc == 1:
            self.answer = "HTTP/1.0 200 OK"
            print "xmlRpc : ",self.xmlRpc
        else:
            self.answer = "HTTP/1.0 406 Invalid key"
        self.xmlRpc = 0

    def xmlRpcError(self, error):
        self.answer = "HTTP/1.0 405 NOT FOUND"
        print "Error"

    def lineReceived(self, line):
        self.lines.append(line)
        if not line and not self.gotRequest:
            text = self.lines[0]
            startText = text.find("sessid")
            if startText>0 :
                endText = text.find("HTTP")
                text=text[startText:endText]
                data = text.split("&")
                sessionId = data[0][data[0].find("=")+1:]
                keyId = int(data[1][data[1].find("=")+1:])
                resourceId = int(data[2][data[2].find("=")+1:])
                self.proxy.callRemote('checkCommand', sessionId,
keyId).addCallbacks(self.xmlRpcResponse, self.xmlRpcError)
            self.sendResponse()
            self.gotRequest = True

    def sendResponse(self):
        responseBody = self.answer
        self.sendLine(self.answer)
        self.sendLine("Content-Type: text/plain")
        self.sendLine("Content-Length: %i" % len(responseBody))
        self.sendLine("")
        self.transport.write(responseBody)
        self.transport.loseConnection()

factory = protocol.ServerFactory()
factory.protocol = HttpProtocol
reactor.listenTCP(SERVICE_PORT, factory)
reactor.run()

XML_RPC answer is correctly  received ("xmlRpc :  1") but the HTTP answer
is always "HTTP/1.0 200 No value" (first initialization)

I tried a other example, based on requesthandler,py

from twisted.web.xmlrpc import Proxy
from twisted.web import http
from twisted.web.xmlrpc import Proxy
from twisted.internet import reactor
import pdb


# HTTP Port from which the OF client contact OpenKeys service
SERVICE_PORT=4080

# URL of the XML-RPC server
OF_XMLRPC_URL="http://127.0.0.1/openkeys.rpc.php"

class MyRequestHandler(http.Request):

    xmlRpc = 0
    def xmlRpcResponse(self, value):
        self.xmlRpc = value
        print repr(value)
        if self.xmlRpc == 1:
           self.setResponseCode(http.OK)
           self.write("<h1>OK</h1>")
        else:
            self.setResponseCode(http.NOT_ALLOWED)
            self.write("<h1>Invalid key</h1>.")
        self.xmlRpc = 0
        self.finish()

    def xmlRpcError(self, error):
        print 'error', error
        self.setResponseCode(http.NOT_FOUND)
        self.write("<h1>Not Found</h1>")
        self.xmlRpc = 0
        self.finish()

    def process(self):
        self.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html')
        data = self.args
        if 'sessid' in data:
            sessionId  = data['sessid'][0]
            keyId      = data["key"][0]
            resourceId = data["resource"][0]
            print "session = ", sessionId
            print "key = ", keyId
            print "resource = ", resourceId
            proxy.callRemote('checkCommand', sessionId,
keyId).addCallbacks(self.xmlRpcResponse, self.xmlRpcError)
        else:
            print "data = ", data
            self.setResponseCode(http.NOT_FOUND)
            self.write("<h1>Not Found</h1>Sorry, no such page.")
            self.finish()

class MyHttp(http.HTTPChannel):
    requestFactory = MyRequestHandler

class MyHttpFactory(http.HTTPFactory):
    protocol = MyHttp

proxy  = Proxy(OF_XMLRPC_URL)
reactor.listenTCP(SERVICE_PORT, MyHttpFactory())
reactor.run()

But in this case an error occur

error [Failure instance: Traceback: <class 'xmlrpclib.Fault'>: <Fault
-32602: 's
erver error. invalid method parameters'>

I try to declare the Proxy(OF_XMLRPC_URL) differently, without success

Where is my mistake ....
Thanks

That code is all wrong, and (to be blunt) pretty horrible too.

Why have you re-implemented a HTTP protocol yourself? You're bound to 
get this wrong (and in fact have, in several ways). Don't do this. Use 
the HTTP stack that comes with Twisted.

Anyway, your major mistake in the 1st example is that, at the end of the 
lineReceived method, you always call the sendResponse() method. This 
happens immediately, before the XMLRPC reply has come back, so your code 
sends "no value". You need to attach the sendResponse method to the 
deferred returned from the xmlrpc call.

I would junk it and start again, like this:

from twisted.web import server, resource, xmlrpc, http

proxy = xmlrpc.Proxy(XMLRPC_URL)

class MyResource(resource.Resource):
   isLeaf = True
   def render_GET(self, request):
     sessid = request.args['sessid'][0]
     keyid = request.args['keyid'][0]
     d = proxy.callRemote('checkCommand', sessid, keyid)
     d.addCallback(self._done, request)
     d.addErrback(self._err, request)
     return server.NOT_DONE_YET

   def _done(self, res, request):
     if res!=1:
       request.setResponseCode(406)
     else:
       request.setResponseCode(200)
     request.finish()

   def _err(self, failure, request):
     request.setResponseCode(405)
     request.finish()

reactor.listenTCP(8080, server.Site(MyResource()))
reactor.run()

Thank for your help

It's right, the code number 1 is not well structured that is the reason I
modified it for the code number 2
But in the first one the xml_rpc call retun the good answer and in the
second one I received a error message

I tried your code,this is a better structure (The Class Resource is in the
next example in the book)

 But the code doesn't work, I have the same error message about xml_rpc
answer

[Failure instance: Traceback: <class 'xmlrpclib.Fault'>: <Fault -32602:
'server error. invalid method parameters'>
C:\python27\lib\site-packages\twisted\internet\posixbase.py:263:_disconnectSelectable

C:\python27\lib\xmlrpclib.py:1137:loads
C:\python27\lib\xmlrpclib.py:793:close
]

The issue is how to call xml_rpc callRemote correctly ?

Thank again

That's an error from the server.  Without knowing how that server works there's
not much we can do to help you; that code will be issuing a well-formed XML-RPC
request, but we can't guess at what that particular server considers valid
method parameters.

At the least an example of an XML-RPC request that the server does accept would
help: we could then suggest how to adjust your code to emit the same request.

Message-ID: <56E63C9A-B1A1-42CD-90BC-E3F5D823F50A@twistedmatrix.com>

I'm leaving my home in the Boston metro area, and moving cross-country.  This move should take at least a couple of weeks.

I currently host buildbots for many of our supported platforms; everything with a 'bot-glyph-*' in front of it on this page: <http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/buildslaves>, and also bot-exarkun-1.  So, when I move (at the latest, 6 weeks from now) these will all go offline.

We need a volunteer who either:

lives somewhere in massachusetts and can plug these in to an ethernet port
wants to re-set-up all of these buildbots on some new hosting

The somewhat less palatable option 3 is to just let much of our build infrastructure be offline for a month.

Glyph,
What sort of resources are necessary for this box?  I'm obviously not in
MA, but could be interested in hosting on new hosting if you can't find
local resources.

Let me know,
Barry

Hi Barry,

A reasonably low-latency residential internet connection should be fine; it needs to be somewhere with a port accessible to the outside world, so a firewall configured to permit SSH traffic and some kind of DNS (dynamic DNS, of course, if it's residential) so that maintainers can SSH to it.

I don't think that's "obvious" to anybody, actually, even if there may be enough forensics in your email headers to help us figure it out :).

Thanks for volunteering.

Once I'm all moved we can just ship the box to my new address; the question is mostly about what to do in the meanwhile, so local resources are much preferred.  However, we'll keep you in mind if nobody else should volunteer.

Hello

I'm starting to learn twisted, I wanted to test the example of twisted
documentation:  finger11
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/tutorial/intro.html

Its is possible to use twistd in Windows console  ?
I tried
- twistd -y finger11.tac but twistd is not recognize
- python finger11.tac, it's run the script but stop and the prompt symbol
come back

How we can test this script ?

Thank

twistd does work on Windows, but doesn't support some features like
daemonization.

This works here:

C:\Python27\python C:\Python27\Scripts\twistd.py -y
./doc/core/howto/tutorial/listings/finger/finger11.tac

Hi

   I come up with a link about this problem
http://groups.google.com/group/cython-users/browse_thread/thread/295937ae99fdfebe/9b0872a76e0172d8#9b0872a76e0172d8

feel free to check it. Thanks

Roughly, It can be concluded that cython has a different generator
implementation so that it can't work well with inlinecallback

Regards

Yes, that is currently the case, but if someone wanted to fix the bug we'd be happy to review a patch.

Standard tower.

Yeah.  We just need the one inbound port (SSH) to fix stuff if it breaks.  The actual buildbot connections are all outgoing.

If you want to drive down to Cambridge to pick it up, I'll buy you dinner while you're here :-).

Hi Glyph,

I'm probably closer to you than Ray, but he sounds like he might have a
better environment.  I'm live in Belmont, 1 block from Cambridge.  I have
FIOS (20Mb, I think, but just a single IP and no A/C.  I haven't used any
dynamic DNS service, but can't imagine it would be too hard to set up. 

...

Another possibility would be my office in Lexington.  Real (though small)
computer room, A/C, limited UPS, etc. and lots of room since we just
consolidated a bunch of servers.  We have both FIOS and ComCast business
service and (at the moment) a couple of spare IP addresses.  We can
firewall it off from everything internal so it would look like it was
sitting on the Internet all by itself.  Or we could provide DNS service
and whatever for it.

We use a fair amount of Twisted and one of my coworkers was recently
saying we should kick in something to the Twisted project.  Maybe this
is a way of doing it.  He's also the guy (currently) in charge of our
network infrastructure, so he's the one I would have to talk it over
with him, but he's on vacation this week.  Also, I'm going to NYC
tomorrow (mini-vacation) so I won't be able to talk to him about it
until late Monday or Tuesday.  It looks like you are moving in early
June at the latest, I think that might work...


A little later...

I dropped him an email, and just heard back.  It sounds fine to him, so
I'm officially making the offer...

Hi Glyph: 
That sounds reasonable -- and a trip to Cambridge to pick it up is no problem. 
Parking, on the other hand is always an exciting prospect as I tend to drive larger vehicles 
(probably take our Sprinter Van for this trip). 

If you decide to have us do the temporary hosting I'm sure we can at least find a loading zone to pack up the systems. 
What sort of timeframe are you looking at (and we can take this off-list to exchange details).

Message-ID: <CEBEC57F-BFB7-4249-B6F3-A8BC6E044357@gmail.com>

hi

I use twisted to build some web services, using twistd to start a application.

When I start the twistd, and without any connection, the cpu usage of twistd process comes to about 10%.

I don't think it's normal. I think it should be much low than this num.

But I don't know how to find the problem is.Would anyone be pleased to help me?

Thanks.

Twisted doesn't use 10% CPU by default; chances are it's some code you 
wrote. Have you tried using a profiler (e.g. cProfile)?

How can i use cProfile with twisted?

Is there any guide or example? 

Thank you very much. I googled and stackoverflowed ,but didn't find any examples.

Hi

  you may look at http://docs.python.org/library/profile.html for some
details.

Hi Guys

I was reading http://technicae.cogitat.io/2012/03/conversation-with-guido-about-callbacks.html
. I'm not done with it yet but I'm sure some of you would have already
read this. Would there be any changes required in Twisted code because
of the views in this blog ? Or put it in another way, is there
anything we can take from it that we can use to help make Twisted
better ?

regards

I don't think so.  Most of what Guido wants is already available via inlineCallbacks, and the drawbacks of using that are documented pretty well in the comments there.  I also have some issues with the premises and conclusions of that article. For example, batching, pipelining and pooling are all easier to implement with a callback-driven style.

I think that article is mainly about aesthetic choices, and the culture of the Python community.  However, it does highlight the need to document the reasons why things are the way that they are in the Twisted world, so that the broader Python community understands that it's not weird for the sake of weird; but this is a documentation issue.  For example, Node.JS doesn't have this problem, despite having a much worse convention of callback spaghetti (as far as I know, they don't have an abstraction analogous to a Deferred yet); this is because the JavaScript community has already accepted callbacks and is intimately familiar with them before approaching Node for the first time.  There are a few analogues in Python (for example, GUI toolkit programming) but a smaller proportion of the community at large are familiar with that style.

But, if you can think of something actionable that would make Twisted better based on that blog post - or anything else, for that matter! - feel free to file a ticket.

Several large JS toolkits have the concept of a Deferred or a Promise.
MochiKit stole Twisted's, where it got forked into Dojo, and then
forked into Google's Closure library. jQuery has a separate Deferred
implementation that looks like Twisted's, and is similar enough that
we can call it a Deferred, although I know a few people who object to
that.

This is a bit off-topic, but generators are expected to be in Harmony
(they're already in Mozilla's JS, stolen wholesale from Python). The
latest specification draft has "yield" as a future reserved word, and
has a reference to an undefined "YieldExpression", though this may
just be an editing oversight.

Right now, you could implement inlineCallbacks in Mozilla JavaScript.

A few years ago, I confirmed that this actually works:

http://ludios.org/js-inlineCallbacks-POC/

(though the above is inconvenient to use because it relied on my fork
of Divmod's JS).

I think there has been similar work in the node.js world.  I recall
some node.js forks that run on SpiderMonkey just so that they can use
its `yield`.
