</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Aah, sweet sanity! Sorry about the delay in my reply, I wanted to wait 
until I could do this post justice (and it's not like PyCon is tomorrow).

&gt;<i> Off the top of my head, and only continuing until I get bored with making
</I>&gt;<i> this point, here's what a &quot;Twisted&quot; session could cover:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  * event driven programming
</I>
Please. I've used event-driven scenarios in GUI frameworks, but I've 
never seen anything (please note: this does *not* imply that nothing 
exists) that makes clear the relationship between the Twisted reactor 
and the code surrounding it.

&gt;<i>  * Deferreds (making them; using them; debugging them; defgen;        
</I>&gt;<i> locks/semaphors)
</I>
These are in essence the fundamentals, no? A complete picture of the 
lifetime of a failed and a successful deferred would, I feel, go a long 
way towards filling in the picture. Plus how deferreds can interact with 
each other?

&gt;<i>  * core reactor APIs
</I>
This too should go into the &quot;must know&quot; category, right?

&gt;<i>  * scheduling
</I>
If we could cover everything up to this point I'd be happy. Like you I 
think it's important to limit the scope if we want to achieve something 
worthwhile, and I can't spend *all* my PyCon time on Twisted. It will be 
up to you guys to make it enjoyable enough to keep me there :-)

Hopefully with community guidance I can lay the foundations for a 
mechanism (a pedagogy, if you will) that many people can use to flesh 
the rest out.

&gt;<i>  * implementing existing (TCP; UDP; IP) protocols
</I>
What, you mean they aren't all implemented yet? :-)

&gt;<i>  * designing new (TCP; UDP; IP) protocols
</I>
Good. That Twisted can get access to the raw network layer is something 
I wasn't aware of.

&gt;<i>  * using existing protocols in twisted core
</I>
Probably more essential than protocol design and implementation, I'd 
have thought.

&gt;<i>  * integrating a protocol implementation with cred
</I>
To make it an authenticated protocol? Haven't met cred yet.

&gt;<i>  * process control/interaction
</I>
I suppose one of the issues with twisted, like other asynchronous 
frameworks, is that you can screw things up really badly just by 
thoughtlessly blocking somewhere inside a handler. So this is probably 
important.

&gt;<i>  * implementing a realm
</I>&gt;<i>  * implementing credentials/checkers
</I>&gt;<i>  * writing services
</I>&gt;<i>  * writing plugins (twistd; lore; cred)
</I>&gt;<i>  * handy general-purpose python utilities
</I>&gt;<i>  * adding new kinds of event sources to the reactor
</I>&gt;<i>  * gui/pygame/etc integration
</I>&gt;<i>  * threading
</I>&gt;<i>  * using SQL databases
</I>&gt;<i>  * Perspective Broker
</I>&gt;<i>  * writing unit tests
</I>&gt;<i>  * using trial
</I>&gt;<i>  * extending trial
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>While the above remaining core issues are all valuable, I don't see us 
getting to them at PyCon.

&gt;<i> Wandering outside of the core of Twisted:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  * serving web pages
</I>&gt;<i>  * running a chat server
</I>&gt;<i>  * extending the chat server
</I>&gt;<i>  * jabber (jabber; jabber; jabber; sasl; jabber)
</I>
I gather you think jabber is significant?

&gt;<i>  * marking up documentation
</I>
The more widely this knowledge is disseminated, hopefully, the better 
the documentation will be.

&gt;<i>  * dns servers and clients
</I>&gt;<i>  * usenet servers and clients
</I>&gt;<i>  * ssh/sftp clients/servers
</I>&gt;<i>  * telnet clients/servers
</I>&gt;<i>  * asynchronous terminal interaction
</I>&gt;<i>  * terminal widget rendering
</I>&gt;<i>  * smtp client/server
</I>&gt;<i>  * imap4 client/server
</I>&gt;<i>  * pop3 client/server
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are any of these the things you have in mind?  Can I get you to pick
</I>&gt;<i> a very small number of them (1 or 2 per hour at most, I suspect; some
</I>&gt;<i> are smaller, others are quite large)?  Or did you have something else
</I>&gt;<i> in mind?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Your detailed knowledge of the structure of Twisted lays bare the huge 
amount of work that *could* be done. However, there may be perfectly 
adequate existing materials on some or all of these topics, and I am 
happy to be pointed towards them.

regards
  Steve
