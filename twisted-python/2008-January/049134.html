For my usage of twisted, these are important to me and I am
the most familiar with them. (See below)


I hate to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;a) Start off simple with a &quot;twisted.web2&quot; example (everyone &quot;gets&quot;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that this is actually something we should avoid in a tutorial.

</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/WebDevelopmentWithTwisted">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/WebDevelopmentWithTwisted</A>).  web2 in
</I>&gt;<i> particular is suffering from an extreme lack of maintenance and still
</I>&gt;<i> has never &quot;officially&quot; been released; work is just starting to get
</I>&gt;<i> underway to unify t.web2 and nevow into t.web and reduce the confusion,
</I>&gt;<i> but this is all still in progress and who knows when, how, or even if it
</I>&gt;<i> will be completed.
</I>

Oh yes, I know, I know.  While learning twisted I read *most* (that's alot
;)
of posts to the twisted-web mailing list.  So I am very familiar with the
state.

That said, oh how I wish you guys could make twisted.web2 the one and
only!!!
It would be good for beginners and others alike.

Note however: I can only barely imagine how hard that might be,
so I am *definitely not* complaining ... Twisted is excellent, thanks very
much for it.


If you get a group of experienced Twisted folks
&gt;<i> together to talk about writing web applications, you're more likely to
</I>&gt;<i> spark a debate than an educational session.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even if all these problems were fixed, and there were a really good,
</I>&gt;<i> well-supported, universally understood web server for Twisted, the
</I>&gt;<i> benefits of Twisted's programming model are not immediately obvious to
</I>&gt;<i> the bread and butter of the web programming world.  Learning how to use
</I>&gt;<i> some combination of Twisted tools to generate a web page will always be
</I>&gt;<i> at least a little bit harder than writing the sort of glorified CGI
</I>&gt;<i> script that most web frameworks require these days - unless you're using
</I>&gt;<i> something like Athena, which might be too much complexity to address in
</I>&gt;<i> a single tutorial session.  (And while Athena is more polished and &quot;one
</I>&gt;<i> right way&quot; than the lower-level HTTP stuff, there is still a painful
</I>&gt;<i> dearth of documentation, not to mention the fact that you need to write
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript as well as Python.)
</I>

&quot;Comet&quot; (aka what Athena does) is one of my main uses of twisted, see

<A HREF="http://svn.xantus.org/shortbus/trunk/cometd-twisted/">http://svn.xantus.org/shortbus/trunk/cometd-twisted/</A>

is some code that I use.

That and other ajax-y stuff.  Not much templating html, etc.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted really shines best when you're writing a client as well as a
</I>&gt;<i> server.  Chat is the quintessential application where Twisted makes the
</I>&gt;<i> most sense - and the lack of a well-documented chat server is much less
</I>&gt;<i> of a problem than the lack of a well-documented web server, since you
</I>&gt;<i> can easily define a wire protocol and wacky semantics for your purpose-
</I>&gt;<i> built tutorial chat application.
</I>
Yes!


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;b) then plug that into a simple sqlite database using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&quot;twisted.enterprise&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> twisted.enterprise is similarly a scary and inconsistent area, and
</I>&gt;<i> requires understanding the interaction of the DB thread and the reactor
</I>&gt;<i> thread.  (And at least part of this section would have to be dedicated
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;and never, ever touch anything in this package aside from adbapi&quot;.)
</I>

I only ever use 'adbapi'.  The reason I say this is database functionality
is pretty darn important for all non-trivial programs, so programmers
need/want
to know about this functionality, wouldn't you agree?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;d) Show how using &quot;twistd&quot; is really convient
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;(i.e. &quot;twistd -ny server.tac&quot; and &quot;twistd -y server.tac&quot;, with some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;logging
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;capability, etc)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This, however, is a great suggestion.  Twisted plugins should be part of
</I>&gt;<i> this discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes.


Thanks again for Twisted!

-Alex
