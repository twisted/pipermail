</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;Thanks Steve Holden for organizing this, it's a great idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Indeed!
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;Some nice topics might include:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Thanks for the suggestions.  Do you have any others?  :-) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For my usage of twisted, these are important to me and I am
</I>&gt;<i> the most familiar with them. (See below)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I hate to
</I>&gt;<i>     rain on your parade here, but I think maybe my explanation of why I
</I>&gt;<i>     don't like these suggestions will spark discussion of more different
</I>&gt;<i>     ones...
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;a) Start off simple with a &quot; twisted.web2&quot; example (everyone &quot;gets&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;http)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     I think that this is actually something we should avoid in a tutorial.
</I>&gt;<i>     The web situation in Twisted is complicated
</I>&gt;<i>     ( <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/WebDevelopmentWithTwisted">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/WebDevelopmentWithTwisted</A>).
</I>&gt;<i>      web2 in
</I>&gt;<i>     particular is suffering from an extreme lack of maintenance and still
</I>&gt;<i>     has never &quot;officially&quot; been released; work is just starting to get
</I>&gt;<i>     underway to unify t.web2 and nevow into t.web and reduce the confusion,
</I>&gt;<i>     but this is all still in progress and who knows when, how, or even if it
</I>&gt;<i>     will be completed.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Oh yes, I know, I know.  While learning twisted I read *most* (that's 
</I>&gt;<i> alot ;)
</I>&gt;<i> of posts to the twisted-web mailing list.  So I am very familiar with 
</I>&gt;<i> the state.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Interesting. I am also subscribed to the twisted.web newsgroup, and I 
have been surprised about how quiet it's been. I imagine that if 
twisted.web2 would be very good for things like high-volume web services 
work. It has relatively few advantages in the heavily-competitive 
templating world, and I have to say that my early experience with Nevow, 
while it caused me to admire the system, wasn't entirely trouble-free. I 
think that may be partly because it wasn't being used in a Twisted 
environment (I'm thinking of the python.org reorganization that was put 
in effect after PyCon 2006).

&gt;<i> That said, oh how I wish you guys could make twisted.web2 the one and 
</I>&gt;<i> only!!!
</I>&gt;<i> It would be good for beginners and others alike.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note however: I can only barely imagine how hard that might be,
</I>&gt;<i> so I am *definitely not* complaining ... Twisted is excellent, thanks 
</I>&gt;<i> very much for it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Hear, hear. And the world needs to know, hence my enthusiasm for &quot;Teach 
Me Twisted&quot;.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     If you get a group of experienced Twisted folks
</I>&gt;<i>     together to talk about writing web applications, you're more likely to
</I>&gt;<i>     spark a debate than an educational session.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Twisted's not alone there, of course.

&gt;<i>     Even if all these problems were fixed, and there were a really good,
</I>&gt;<i>     well-supported, universally understood web server for Twisted, the
</I>&gt;<i>     benefits of Twisted's programming model are not immediately obvious to
</I>&gt;<i>     the bread and butter of the web programming world.  Learning how to use
</I>&gt;<i>     some combination of Twisted tools to generate a web page will always be
</I>&gt;<i>     at least a little bit harder than writing the sort of glorified CGI
</I>&gt;<i>     script that most web frameworks require these days - unless you're
</I>&gt;<i>     using
</I>&gt;<i>     something like Athena, which might be too much complexity to address in
</I>&gt;<i>     a single tutorial session.  (And while Athena is more polished and &quot;one
</I>&gt;<i>     right way&quot; than the lower-level HTTP stuff, there is still a painful
</I>&gt;<i>     dearth of documentation, not to mention the fact that you need to write
</I>&gt;<i>     JavaScript as well as Python.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Right. I think a Django replacement might be a bit ambitious for an open 
space session or two ...

Maybe once I get into Twisted I'll be able to lend a hand with t.w2 
development (or maybe not).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Comet&quot; (aka what Athena does) is one of my main uses of twisted, see
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://svn.xantus.org/shortbus/trunk/cometd-twisted/">http://svn.xantus.org/shortbus/trunk/cometd-twisted/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> is some code that I use. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That and other ajax-y stuff.  Not much templating html, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>That's neat, but definitely a few too many layers for a starter project.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Twisted really shines best when you're writing a client as well as a
</I>&gt;<i>     server.  Chat is the quintessential application where Twisted makes the
</I>&gt;<i>     most sense - and the lack of a well-documented chat server is much less
</I>&gt;<i>     of a problem than the lack of a well-documented web server, since you
</I>&gt;<i>     can easily define a wire protocol and wacky semantics for your purpose-
</I>&gt;<i>     built tutorial chat application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes!
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>I'd suggest possibly a client/server game , but I am under the 
impression that's already taken care of.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;b) then plug that into a simple sqlite database using
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;&quot; twisted.enterprise&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     twisted.enterprise is similarly a scary and inconsistent area, and
</I>&gt;<i>     requires understanding the interaction of the DB thread and the reactor
</I>&gt;<i>     thread.  (And at least part of this section would have to be dedicated
</I>&gt;<i>     to &quot;and never, ever touch anything in this package aside from adbapi&quot;.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>We'll definitely stay away from that, then.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I only ever use 'adbapi'.  The reason I say this is database functionality
</I>&gt;<i> is pretty darn important for all non-trivial programs, so programmers 
</I>&gt;<i> need/want
</I>&gt;<i> to know about this functionality, wouldn't you agree?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>Important but not fundamental, I'd say.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;d) Show how using &quot;twistd&quot; is really convient
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;(i.e. &quot;twistd -ny server.tac&quot; and &quot;twistd -y server.tac&quot;, with some
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;logging
</I>&gt;<i>      &gt;capability, etc)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yes, yes, yes! If I could come away with a clear understanding of how a 
.tac file encapsulated one or more Twisted network services I'd be happy.

&gt;<i>     This, however, is a great suggestion.  Twisted plugins should be
</I>&gt;<i>     part of
</I>&gt;<i>     this discussion. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for Twisted!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>This is great. Keep it coming! Still looking for reading suggestions ...

regards
  Steve
