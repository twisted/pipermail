</I>How about a twisted version of the (in)famous &quot;webapp in 20 minutes&quot;? 
Maybe not a stupid blog but some kind of remote management by using 
conch? That would be:
- simple persistence (maybe just files but async)
- business logic (conch connecting to a host and doing stuff)
- presentation layer with web or web2

I did something like that a few month back and had a hard time gathering 
all the pieces of information ;) I still can't believe I have to parse 
raw response strings to handle POST ;))

cheers
