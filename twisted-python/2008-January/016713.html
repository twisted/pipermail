Having a canonical representation doesn't exclude having multiple
representations.

Looking at how these are actually used:
- str() is used only for copyright (and tests)
- short is used for __init__.py
- base is used for short, in _release._changeVersionInFile (don't know
why base rather than everyone else, actually) and dist.py
- repr is only used generically.
- getVersionString is used only by deprecate.

In summary, sometimes we want the project name, sometimes we want the
svn revno. This is perhaps better achieved by having a single function
/ method that takes a couple of params.

Personally, I think that having a project name in Version is silly.

&gt;<i> I was sort of hoping that we might have Version-alike objects at some

</I>&gt;<i> view out too much; inspecting the model directly binds any potential
</I>&gt;<i> view very tightly to the x.y.z versioning scheme.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
For the purposes of this discussion, that is a massive, massive YAGNI.

&gt;<i> But, this is somewhat obviously a bike shed, so I am not going to

</I>
Right. I propose we do nothing.
