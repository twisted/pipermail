Hi,

I hope some one could offer me some help on this. I am quite new to both
python and twisted.

The thing I do may sounds a bit wierd. I am using a pyicq-0.6-t. As
pyicq-0.6-t only works with twisted-2.2 or earlier, so I chose to install
twisted-2.2. However, I wished to use epollreactor as the default
selectreactor only supports 1024 file descriptors. So I copied the relevant
files of epollreactor which is installed on twisted-2.5 to the
site-packages/twisted-2.2 directory. I copied 5 files in the total,
epollreactor.py, epoll..pyx to the twisted/internet directory, _epoll.py
_epoll.pyc and _epoll.so to twisted/python directory. I can't remember the
exact file names. I copied it with a hope that it works. I am not sure
whether I am doing thing stupid here. correct me if I am.

The thing is, after I changed the reactor.py to import epollreactor,
pyicq-0.6-t seems to be using epollreactor but it still can only supports
1024 open sockets. I thought the problem is only in selectreactor? I
figured this out by doing a netstat -a -n on linux and found that
pyicq-0.6-t only opened about 1017 maximum concurrent sockets. I presume
that would mean only around 1000 connections can be made.

Although strange, but I do have a reason to use pyicq-0.6-t which is an
outdated version.

thanks a lot.

regards,
Steven
