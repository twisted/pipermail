<PRE>Hi Simon,

No offense intended, but what is so inaccessible about an event loop?   
Please
understand, I hear people say that Twisted is hard to grok all the time,
but I really don't get *why*.

I'm asking you because you didn't say &quot;I don't get Twisted&quot;; rather, you
said Twisted is an &quot;inaccessible concept&quot;.  I'd really like to know
what that concept is, as you see it, because I suspect there is something
useful in that.  I'm also betting that your concept of Twisted is different
 from mine, and that difference may help me do a better job of explaining
Twisted to people when I talk about it in my work.

&gt;<i> ... but if you persevere, its great! You just have to leave part of your  
</I>&gt;<i> brain behind in a field in hampshire :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, good stuff.  Which part do you have to leave behind?  The part that
expects code to execute synchronously, or something else?

&gt;<i> I'd suffer the pain, just for deferreds!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree, deferreds are a nice abstraction, which is why the recent spate
of inlineCallbacks-related posts alarms me.
