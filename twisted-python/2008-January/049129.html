Yes, I got something useful, it's going to be deployed soon but 
eventually I didn't come out with acls. Even though I have to say 
ldaptor fits well in my project and for some aspects I'm happier than 
with openldap.

&gt;<i> In short, is there a simple example of a server with a sql backend,
</I>&gt;<i> that implement searches ?
</I>
I have a web application I wrote with twisted web. This application 
saves data in a sqlite file. Whenever the user modifies it from the web, 
the application updates also the files used by ldaptor, since what I 
need is only to export them with ldap.

It does not have acls, but I managed to get something similar by 
patching how the ldap server works. Moreover, to prevent corruption I 
modified how operations different from search behave.

What do you want to do?

About doc: in ldaptor/protocols/ldap/ldapserver.py I found nearly 
everything I needed, give al look also to ldaptor/ldiftree.py to see how 
not to store everything in memory but in a filesystem. Also give a look 
at <A HREF="http://www.inoi.fi/open/trac/ldaptor/browser/trunk/test-ldapserver.tac">http://www.inoi.fi/open/trac/ldaptor/browser/trunk/test-ldapserver.tac</A>

I hope it is enough, I've been able to understand how it works from 
these files.

Bye,

Ottavio
