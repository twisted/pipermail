</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the recent spate of inlineCallbacks-related posts alarms me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Why? Using inlineCallbacks just helps writing convenient syntax
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; utilizing deferreds. If you ever wrote code which uses lots of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; deferreds, you know that the code is (visually) lacking a decent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; structure. It's just not the way you think and makes things hard to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; read. inlineCallbacks just turns this into a nice, linear piece of code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; again (linear not to be confused with synchronous!).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem I have with this is that I find that it actually obscures
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the flow of the code and data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The low-level flow of code (control going back to the reactor) is obscured, 
</I>&gt;<i> but I think that is an advantage rather than a disadvantage, since the 
</I>&gt;<i> high-level flow of code (the sequence of operations) becomes more clear. 
</I>&gt;<i> The flow of data is explicit in both cases: it is either passed as callback 
</I>&gt;<i> parameters or as return values from &quot;yield&quot;.
</I>
In the vast majority of network applications, I believe deferred
operations are not sequenced in a linear fashion; they're happening in
an overlapping and concurrent fashion. The problem with data flow in the
case of &quot;yield&quot; is that every time &quot;yield&quot; is invoked, all sorts of
state can get mutated around you that wouldn't normally happen when
calling another function. For a normal function, this also happens when
you return control to your caller, but by that time you don't care; but
in a generator, you're going to be resumed again. The &quot;yield&quot; keyword
doesn't seem to act as a very good &quot;red flag&quot; for this kind of context
switch, especially once it starts getting buried in a more complex
expression.

&gt;<i> &gt; Most deferred operations have no need to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be serialized, and shouldn't be; the linear nature of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inlineCallbacks-style makes it very easy to accidentally serialize
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; operations that could otherwise run in parallel instead. Even if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; write the generator correctly, it's not as obvious what the actual flow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is since it has been crunched into a linear-looking function.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are quite a few cases in which the dependencies between the operations 
</I>&gt;<i> force sequential processing. In those cases, inline callbacks are useful.
</I>
I've personally encountered very few cases where there are more than a
handful of operations in sequence.

&gt;<i> For example, to serve a web page, I want to authenticate the user, then run 
</I>&gt;<i> a database query and finally present the result.
</I>
Generally in my code, these are being handled by three different layers
of code that are mostly hooked up by Twisted and other frameworks; for
example, authentication is being handled by cred/guard in my web
applications. Thus, there isn't really any single function where all
these operations are plumbed together.

&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, it is extremely hard to unit test a generator using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inlineCallbacks, as there is no easy way of resuming the generator
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at certain points with certain state to test each part of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; generator.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the code using inline callbacks looks like this, there is no problem in 
</I>&gt;<i> testing the parts separately:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	result1 = yield function1(arg)
</I>&gt;<i> 	result2 = yield function2(result1)
</I>
But if it really looks like that, there's not much point in writing that
instead of this:

    result1 = function1(arg)
    result2 = result1.addCallback(function2)
