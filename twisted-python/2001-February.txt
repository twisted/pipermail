Subject: [Twisted-Python] spatial, graphical, RPG
Message-ID: <20010205213632.A5128@Fookidla.org>

(I CC-d this to reality@ because it's a cross-over subject, but since the
topic encompasses reality as well as twisted python in general, I suppose
it's best to continue it on twisted-python@)

Glyph and I have talked a bit about a project that I'm thinking about doing - 
a spatial, graphical (don't get your shorts all bunched up - I'll talk about 
this in a bit) RPG. I'd like to utilize much of the functionality in Twisted
Python, and I think even some features directly from reality could be 
useful.

Glyph and I have differing views on this. He mentioned integrating
the spatial relativity into twisted.reality directly, whereas I think
that this RPG should be in a different module, but maybe utilizing some
of reality. 

Before I give you my perspective, I'll tell you that I haven't worked with
TR a whole lot, but I've done a bit of code-reading.

This RPG is *meant* to be graphical. That is, it doesn't need lots of 
features that are in twisted.reality. It probably is possible to integrate
spatial relativity into TR, and it might even be nice for some situations,
but I don't think it'd be useful for mine. With the goals I have in mind,
stuff like English grammar and gender (for ie) are irrelevant in most cases - 
stuff that is built into the core of TR. 

I realize that there is probably a lot of naivete in this post, so I'm urging
everyone (especially glyph :>) to respond. I'm willing to do the best thing, 
even if it means completely changing my design :) But currently, I don't think
having the "cruft" (in this context) of text-based games in a spatial, 
graphical-based RPG is the best thing.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Bug involving Interface.pixel, Interface.box, and Method
Message-ID: <20010206175054.A5936@Fookidla.org>

Here's the low-down of a bug that I can't seem to squash. 
If you go to one of the pages in my site, ie 
http://twistedmatrix.com:8010/code , you'll see that the pixel images
around the table are referenced as /code/pixel (which doesn't exist).
This should be /pixel, but since the request that's eventually being passed
to Interface.box() is from /code, it's trying to get /code/pixel. If you'd
like to see the code for my site, it's at 
http://twistedmatrix.com:8010/mysite.py. I'm fairly certain that it's not
a bug in my code, but an issue involving both box() and Method.

I thought of a few no-good hacks to get around this.
1) I can just have box() reference /pixel rather than /requestpath/pixel, but
this obviously won't work for sites whose / isn't an Interface.

2) I can provide a Method.getChild that returns (basically, not literally) 
../request, or something like that. Blech. 

So. I'm clueless. Thanks for any help.

[ stuff about bugs, pixels, and boxes ]

This isn't a bug -- since those methods (box, etc) are designed to be used
by Interface, it expects that the current page will have a child called
'pixel' that will provide the image support that it needs.

Also, this starts to beg the question of creating an actual *good* HTML
generation library; the stuff in twisted.web is extremely hacky.  However,
it does outline a general philosophy that I'd like to preserve, so here
you go --

Twisted.Web was not, and is not, designed as a "content" (i.e.
design-heavy text) generation tool.  It is intended to be used to generate
an efficient, distributed interface to stateful Python programs.

To that end, it's desirable that whatever HTML generation API comes with
it should treat them as program interface elements; wherever possible
displaying a traceback if generating one of them fails (this is the
philosophy behind .runBox() -- segregating the page into elements both
visually and in code).

I am open to suggestions as to how to achieve that goal.

I checked in some stuff that allows multiple servers to answer web
requests.  It works with CGI requests.  It should be transparent to
authors of Resources, but it does start up a different kind of server (it
uses gloop).  There are some changes to the gloop protocol.  I'm tired, so
I'm going to bed.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.21.0102220151440.8457-100000@zaibach.twistedmatrix.com>

hi there, folks:

I'd really like to release 0.7.0 but I would like it to be at least a
little bit tested before I do so.  Could those of you with CVS trees check
everything out and see if it performs as advertised?  Deeper bugs than
that will have to wait for the next release, but I'd at least like to know
if it works for someone other than me.

Thanks.
