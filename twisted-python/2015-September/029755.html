<PRE>Hi all,

The Twisted project needs volunteers to help us with fundraising.

Although we have several sponsor logos on the front page of our website, all but only one of them, Variomedia (thanks Variomedia!) is actually current; every other sponsor has expired, and we just haven't gotten around to removing them yet.  (So if you work at Dyn, Olark, or CritSend please remind your employer to renew!)

As you may know, Twisted is a member project of the Software Freedom Conservancy <A HREF="https://sfconservancy.org">https://sfconservancy.org</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://sfconservancy.org/">https://sfconservancy.org/</A>&gt;, so that you can donate to the project as a tax-deductable 501(c)3 donation in the United States.

Unfortunately, the project leadership committee who interfaces with the SFC - including myself - is a very busy group of people who don't have a lot of time to dedicate to the nuts and bolts of working with a non-profit.  The SFC itself provides basic support for our sponsorship program, helping us write ad copy, updating the logos on the website, and reminding sponsors when their sponsorships have expired - but they can't do all of our fundraising for us.  We need someone to find potential sponsors, speak on behalf of the project, and generally be good at following up email requests and answering questions about the program, and to work with the SFC on the Twisted project's behalf.

In the past we've had a lot of success with sponsoring development; you can see our history of sponsored development on <A HREF="http://labs.twistedmatrix.com">http://labs.twistedmatrix.com</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://labs.twistedmatrix.com/">http://labs.twistedmatrix.com/</A>&gt;.  Dedicated reviewers and focused effort on specific problems have made the project much more long-term viable.  But if we run out of sponsors completely we will no longer be able to do that.

Would anyone like to volunteer to do some fundraising, and in the process, possibly save Twisted? :-)

Thanks in advance,

-glyph
