this. I also plan on resubmitting a reworked patch that addresses the
issues that glyph raised.

I have no issue with changing the name or if this patch lives as a
project besides twisted. I might even rework it into something more
forward-compatible as suggested by glyph. I think netstrings are a
decent option as it would make long value handling easier since values
would always be contiguous without &quot;continuation markers&quot; interspersed.
The main thing I dislike about netstrings are the variable-length ASCII
numbers, but that is not a big complexity. Could the next AMP version
use values framed using 32 bit or 64 bit integers ?


Transmitting long-ish values is a real use case and whatever extension
we do must retain the dead-simple, easy to implement nature of the
current AMP protocol. I now realise that I somewhat hijacked the
&quot;streaming values&quot; bug (2529). IMHO, streaming should be handled at the
application level, but I digress.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW this is also my suggestion for the PR trying to introduce support for
</I>&gt;<i> SMB.... have twisted SMB implementation in a separate project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>All the best,

Jonathan
