</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - It exposes a new top-level name rather than setting the protocol version
</I>&gt;<i> as a parameter
</I>&gt;<i> - The NEWS files are malformed which is going to lead to some confusing

</I>&gt;<i> - AMPv2 itself does not appear to be &quot;standardized&quot; - the page at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://amp-protocol.net/conversations_v2.html">https://amp-protocol.net/conversations_v2.html</A> appears to be a

</I>&gt;<i> something broadly implemented; for one thing, I'd never heard of it before
</I>&gt;<i> and for another the site itself doesn't link the document. This would be
</I>&gt;<i> fine as a first draft, but I think it needs to be given some more
</I>&gt;<i> revisions, given that (for example) there are a number of
</I>&gt;<i> backwards-compatible ways to do this.
</I>&gt;<i> - The layering is wrong because it puts the protocol-parsing into a leaf
</I>&gt;<i> class in the hierarchy, when the parsing logic was deliberately isolated to
</I>&gt;<i> a lower level to facilitate different framing mechanisms.
</I>&gt;<i> - As JP pointed out, the tests have a potential bug where they can leak
</I>&gt;<i> errors between cases.

</I>&gt;<i> I don't normally like to revert folks' work once it's been reviewed and

</I>&gt;<i> without much more context on who is implementing it and what other options
</I>&gt;<i> were considered, particularly when I personally (nominally the inventor of
</I>&gt;<i> AMP) don't like the direction it has taken :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do other folks think?  Anyone else have more of a finger on the pulse
</I>&gt;<i> of where the &quot;v2&quot; conversation has been happening?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Just my 2 cents

I think that whether this should be reverted or reworked should be between
the person raising this issue (Glyph) and the author of the PR (Jonathan).

I see that Jonathan has responded to the feedback inside the merged PR.I
hope it can be reworked.

Since AMP v2 is not standardized maybe is ok to have it as a separate
experimental top level name.

I have never used AMP ...I tried to use it via ampoule but ended up using
the stdlib process pool as I was not able see any performance difference.

Since `amp` is used by `trial -j`  we need to keep it inside twisted.

But since AMP v2 is experimental, I think that is best to have it as a
separate txamp2 project.
In this way, the twisted AMP v2 project can follow its own rules.
Once AMP v2 is &quot;mature&quot; it can be moved to core twisted

So my take is to revert it and move it to twisted/txamp2.

----

BTW this is also my suggestion for the PR trying to introduce support for
SMB.... have twisted SMB implementation in a separate project.
