It's not exactly that they're &quot;forcing&quot; users (or clients) to do anything. They're just notifying the user that they're in a particular channel.  In other words, the &quot;forcing&quot; is all done server-side, not in the protocol itself.

&gt;<i> These two things mean that you cannot have a Deferred-based API for

This is actually a better way to structure applications in general, even for much more sanely structured protocols than IRC.

One subtle point about Twisted is that while Deferreds make it a lot easier to manage sequential work-flow in an event driven system, it is sequential work-flow itself that is the problem in many cases.  You should always try to write your protocols so they can react to any valid input at any time, not rigidly structure everything so that your state is always shoehorned into a request/response structure so all your state is encapsulated in stack frames in closures that are added as callbacks on Deferreds.

If I were designing a new chat protocol today, I'd definitely make sure it had a &quot;you joined a conversation&quot; message that did not have to be a response to any particular &quot;I'd like to join a conversation&quot; message :-).
