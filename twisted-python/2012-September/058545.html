You don't need the clients to authenticate as anonymous; the XML RPC code
can say &quot;if there's no credentials from client, login as anonymous.&quot;



&gt;<i> I've got a bit further since my initial email, and my current approach is
</I>&gt;<i> to extend t.w.server.Site to accept a portal.  I'm currently trying to
</I>&gt;<i> separate the useful bits from the flash in the requestAvatarID and
</I>&gt;<i> _??Authenticate methods in dbcred.py.  It would be nice to have something
</I>&gt;<i> as straight-forward as cred.py that also implemented a realm and a
</I>&gt;<i> credentials checker so that I could see how all those pieces fit together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I would just add a Portal to the XML-RPC object, rather than the Site.

I'll try to write some example code later today, if I have time.
