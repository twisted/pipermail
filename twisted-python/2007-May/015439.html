Since it is used as a decorator, the @sequential line will be written by the 
same person who wrote the function itself. If the author of the function 
knows it is not a generator, why would he apply @sequential (or 
@inlineCallbacks) to it?

&gt;<i> For example, 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @sequential
</I>&gt;<i> def foo():
</I>&gt;<i> 	yield retval
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> should just behave the same as
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @sequential
</I>&gt;<i> def foo():
</I>&gt;<i> 	return retval
</I>
That behaviour would be: return a Deferred on which:
- callback is called immediately if retval is not a Deferred
- errback is called immediately if the function raises an exception
- callback or errback is called when the retval Deferred fires
And the result passed to the callback would be None, not retval.

Applying maybeDeferred to the return value sounds more useful, since that will 
do the Deferred part, but will also preserve the result.

By the way, without &quot;@sequential&quot; the closest non-generator equivalent of

def foo():
	yield retval

would be

def foo():
	return (retval, )

In other words, it would return a sequence containing retval rather than 
retval itself.

&gt;<i> I can't think of any case where passing a non-generator into
</I>&gt;<i> @sequential is intended to mean anything other than this.
</I>
But should it be given any interpretation at all? Unless there is a real use 
case for it, I think it's better to consider it an error.

Bye,
