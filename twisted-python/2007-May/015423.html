<PRE>Event loops everywhere&#8230;

I've inherited a small python utility that we use for system monitoring. It
uses CORBA to capture event traffic and report some status (using CORBA
EventService registration, status events) via a Tkinter GUI. The app is run
by the Tk &quot;mainloop&quot; and at frequent intervals calls the orb's
perform_work() method to process events. This approach of calling frequently
into the ORB seems to work OK and does not appear to hold up the GUI.

I need to update the app so that it can handle the event service
disappearing and re-appearing (i.e. Make it a bit more robust to handle the
remote end starting/stopping). We want this tool to run continuously while
the system we monitor is started and stopped. It needs to reconnect when the
system comes up and not crash when the system shuts down.

I would also like to take the opportunity to make the CORBA related code
somewhat more generic (not bound to the Tk mainloop) so I can use it for
other tools which will not have a GUI and hence no TK mainloop. The Twisted
framework seems ideal - I am familiar with Twisted, I think I could use it's
task.LoopingCall to perform the re-connections and the perform_work call,
the Tkinter mainloop can be integrated into the Twisted reactor etc. Many of
our apps are Twisted based so having a common code base is plus for future
maintenance too.

There is no point pursuing this approach if it is well known that the ORB
does not work within the reactor. So to possibly save me some prototyping
time, I was wondering if  anyone had (or heard of) any experience's of
running the ORB within the reactor? Specifically I'm using omniOrbPy and the
omniOrb ORB.

Regards,
Chris
