<PRE>I have an issue I am having some trouble figuring out. I have been using 
SSL and XML-RPC/SOAP for a while without any problem. I now have to go 
past the &quot;normal&quot; usage.

Inside of my XML-RPC/SOAP handler I need to get access to the X509 
certificate of the client (I need to get access to some of the fields 
inside the certificate).

When I asked before I was told the correct way to solve the problem was 
to use avatars. Immediately I started looking into how to do it. 
Yesterday I seemed to come to the conclusion that I don't see how 
avatars (and realms) will help me.

It seems the SSL validation happens way before any sort of realm would 
be involved (since realms seem to be tied into &quot;logging into&quot; the 
system). All the examples I have found seem to be exactly this model. 
What I can't seem to find is first, how to tie realms into XML-RPC or 
SOAP. Secondly, how does the client's X509 certificate get into the 
avatar. And thirdly, I just don't see how the avatar is even past into 
the XML-RPC/SOAP handler.

I was wondering if one of the creators of Twisted could provide some 
detailed guidance? If so, I will be more than happy to write  it up and 
add it to the Twisted documentation for all to see and understand.

Thanks,
Chaz
