Hey Eric,

Thanks for showing the Windows love.  The most pressing win32 issue
for me is the large number of reactor unclean warnings in the
win32event reactor.

&gt;<i>From #2091:
</I>    One other thing: the win32-win32er slave had about 250 more errors
    with this branch merged than without it. win32er may not be a
    completely supported reactor, but introducing this many new errors
    to even an unsupported reactor makes me very nervous and I think
    we should try to avoid doing it.


Another very important issue is the buildslaves. As a UNIX[1]
developer, the buildslaves are my primary point of interaction with
the Windows world. This leads to two things:

    1. It's hard to care about the win32er and iocp reactors when they
are always red.[2]
    2. It would be very nice for the &quot;remove-.pyc&quot; step to always work.


That's it from me. Thanks again for taking the time to look after win32.

cheers,
jml

[1] I feel justified in calling Mac OS X a UNIX. It helps me sleep.
[2] Perhaps we should have two buildbot pages: &quot;supported&quot; and
&quot;unsupported&quot;. win32er, iocp, tsr, pypy and friends can all hide on
&quot;unsupported&quot;.
