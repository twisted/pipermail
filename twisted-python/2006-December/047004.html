&gt;<i>They don't have that capability, no. I guess you could modify them to do

</I>This is a statistical algorithm I'm trying to parallelize to run on a 
cluster, and the serial version strongly suggests that the behavior I've 
asked for would be a big help.

I'll try to describe my serial algorithm succinctly, any advice on 
parallelizing it would be extremely welcome.

I have a bunch of objects which are nodes in a  directed acyclic graph. 
I've pseudocoded them in the attached file. What I'd like to do is push 
some of the nodes off to other processes running on the cluster and have 
them retain references to their parents. I'll then make repeated calls 
to all nodes' get_prob() methods and periodically update their values.

It would be nice to make Node.value something like a Cacheable. I'd like 
it to store n remote references, with a timestamp (this just needs to be 
an integer counter, as in the pseudocode) attached to each. When 
queried, it could return its timestamp and value as a tuple.

Thanks again,
Anand
