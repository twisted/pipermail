It depends if it's easier to keep track of when changes happen, or determine what the current state is.

If it's easier to keep track of when changes happen, I would recommend calling `setServiceParent` to add/remove the service to the active service hierarchy.  (This will call `startService` / `stopService` for you automatically, as well as cooperating with things like ^c so it's better than calling them yourself).

If it's easier to query the current state, then a conditional in the timer is a lot simpler.
