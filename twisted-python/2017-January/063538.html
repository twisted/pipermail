Thanks for the quick reply.

Can you point to some docs about setServiceParent being used to remove the service?  I couldn't find that anywhere.

I'm leaning towards that approach, because it would just consolidate where I write conditional (one place vs 9 services).  I had intended to run nagios, but got lazy and just installed monit, which was took under 3 minutes to install and configure to invoke an alert and touch/remove a marker on the filesystem to indicate state.
