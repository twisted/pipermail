</I>&gt;<i> implementations of DummyRequest (including more than a few I'm sure I've
</I>&gt;<i> written).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Though, note, the link I gave above was support code for something very
similar to this treq code:
<A HREF="https://github.com/ScatterHQ/flocker/blob/master/flocker/restapi/testtools.py#L460">https://github.com/ScatterHQ/flocker/blob/master/flocker/restapi/testtools.py#L460</A>

To clarify your point a bit (I think):


   - MemoryAgent (from Flocker) provides a testing IAgent by implementing
   an IRequest that does in-memory resource traversal to dispatch requests and
   generate responses.
   - RequestTraversalAgent (from treq) provides a testing IAgent by
   implementing (using) iosim to do in-memory protocol/transport interacts to
   drive an in-memory HTTP conversation that runs all of the regular Twisted
   Web HTTP processing machinery.

RequestTraversalAgent's approach is better because the protocol/transport
interface is better defined.  Because it's better
defined, RequestTraversalAgent doesn't have to touch pieces that we might
want to consider implementation details (whether they're _-prefixed or
not).  It also invokes a larger portion of the real implementation code
making it more likely to be a realistic simulation of real-world use of the
code.

Having spelled this out, what occurs to me now is
that RequestTraversalAgent is really just a step or so up the ladder and
there's further to go.  For example, RequestTraversalAgent only needs to
exist at all because `iosim` has a distinct interface.  This distinct
interface means you need a RequestTraversalAgent-like thing for each
reactor-using thing for which you want to provide a test double.  If this
adaption behavior were bundled up differently then I think we'd get a lot
more in-memory test doubles for free (or closer to it - we'd be another
rung up the ladder, at least).  That seems like it would be a big win given
how *few* of these testing helpers Twisted has historically managed to
provide (suggesting it's just too hard to do so given the current tools).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a set of ideas that I've been gradually arriving at over a long
</I>&gt;<i> period of time, but it's probably high time for some public discussion by
</I>&gt;<i> now, even if it's just everybody saying &quot;yeah, that sounds good&quot; :-).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
So, it pretty much sounds good, though with the above refinements. :)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a related note, 'proto_helpers' is in a super awkward place.
</I>&gt;<i>  'twisted.testing', anyone? :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes.  I almost suggested this about a week ago when I was preparing to
contribute some testing code but then realized I couldn't contribute the
code after all. :(
