Ideally we'd have a message-passing system that could use multiple 
backends (i.e. shared memory, mmap, or sockets).  Using sockets is 
probably a better solution for now -- you're likely to do a lot of 
copying anyway, cause it's Python and PIL :)

With sockets, you can scale right to multiple computers.. with shared 
memory, you're stuck on a single box.  The API that POSH exposes 
(proxied non-blocking objects) can't scale well to multiple machines, 
where a socket-based API could be scaled down to actually use an 
efficient shared memory implementation at some point.
