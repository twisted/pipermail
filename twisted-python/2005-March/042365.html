&gt;<i> oscar.py I explicitly pulled out after talking to the author.  I was also

Not so much &quot;pulled from Twisted&quot; as &quot;Twisted being pulled apart&quot;. See
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/upgrades/2.0/split.xhtml">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/upgrades/2.0/split.xhtml</A>
for more information.

&gt;<i> jabber tree... will this stay with Twisted core?  i'm not sure there is
</I>&gt;<i> anything we've actually changed with this tree.
</I>&gt;<i> oscar.py... is this indeed being pulled out?  We've done quite a few
</I>&gt;<i> enhancements to it so it's far from what it was in Twisted.  (at some
</I>&gt;<i> point when I consider it stable, I was going to send it back to the author
</I>&gt;<i> if he was interested)
</I>&gt;<i> msn.py... similar situation to oscar.py
</I>&gt;<i> domish.py/xmlstream.py... these are obviously important parts of twisted
</I>&gt;<i> itself but that weren't working well as is.  I can get more details on
</I>&gt;<i> this.  If both are fixed well in Twisted 2.0, we may be able to begin
</I>&gt;<i> pulling out tlib stuff and tell people to use Twisted 2.0 instead.  All in
</I>&gt;<i> all, we would like to be able to point people at a release, not an svn
</I>&gt;<i> tree.  Besides, I've run into numerous people that don't have/want svn
</I>&gt;<i> installed ( =( ), or who's company/whatever firewalls prevented getting to
</I>&gt;<i> svn trees.
</I>
None of this stuff is in &quot;Twisted Core&quot; any more, however, the chat
stuff is all in Twisted Words
(<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/words">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/words</A>) and domish is in Twisted
Xish (<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/xish">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/xish</A>). This split is to help
us remain agile in project management / release / development, so I
urge you not to look on it as a bad thing. Being pulled out of the
core is probably going to *help* you. And 2.0 is going to be released
any day now (I was going to release the third prerelease today, but
ran into a bug. It'll go out tomorrow. The actual release will go out
shortly afterward).

&gt;<i> Would it help if I popped in the irc chatroom for a bit to discuss these
</I>&gt;<i> things 'in person'?
</I>
Not a bad idea.
