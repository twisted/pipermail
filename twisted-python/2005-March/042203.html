This is a capability I'm interested in also.

Wouldn't it have more the character of a service than a
protocol?  I.e., a service that might have one or more
protocols associated with it, and be configured depending
on the environment and requirements of the application
that wants to use the connection.

Good points.  I guess auto-discovery is the only capability
I need in addition to what's already provided by PB, which
I would expect could manage the configuration of clustering,
etc.  Once autodiscovery was done, the peers could use PB
to work out the configuration details.
