</I>My goal is somewhat similar in that I have multiple CPU's that aren't 
being used very much, but the other problem is that certain libraries I 
use (PIL) grab the GIL for long-running operations like image 
modifications. I can thread them off, but it still liberally acquires 
the GIL and makes the server unresponsive for the duration of the operation.

I too had looked at using Perspective Broker to communicate with 
separate &quot;worker&quot; processes, and the only reason I'm not excited with 
that option is that the bandwidth between the master and worker 
processes involves a lot of large binary strings. Shared memory seemed 
more efficient than PB for transferring those strings.

So for that reason, finding out how many CPU's I have isn't that 
important, because I'll still want more worker processes than I have CPU's.
