<PRE>I plan on releasing 2.0 *for real* early next week.

First, please take a look at the bug tracker. There are a few urgent
issues left which I'm interested in, as well as a bunch of
trivial-looking [PATCH]es that would be cool to get in for 2.0. I plan
on doing some of that this weekend.

I'm also planning on getting the totally reworked project-oriented
website (thanks much to Mary Gardiner) polished off and deployed some
time this weekend.

I need help on doing the release notes for 2.0. Traditionally this has
been Itamar's job, but James also recently volunteered. It'd be really
awesome if someone could do this for me so I don't have to think about
it. :-)

Project Maintainers!

Twisted: Glyph, Itamar, Jp
Conch: Paul
Flow: Clark
Lore: Andrew, Moshe
Mail, Names, News: Jp
Pair: Tommi
Runner: Andrew
Web: Donovan
Words: Jp, Glyph, ...?
Xish: Uh, what's that guy's name? Dave or something? I don't think
he's been very involved.

Please update your README files and tell me what version number you
want your project to have. Currently I'm assuming everything is at
0.1.0 except for conch and web which are both at 0.5.0. Also take a
look at your setup.py file and any other topfiles for your project to
make sure they're what you want (In case you've been under a rock,
those are located in Twisted/twisted/&lt;yourproj&gt;/topfiles/ in the
repository).

Packagers!

Get cracking.


If I think of anything else, feel safe knowing I will bug you about it.
