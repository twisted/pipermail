<PRE>&gt;<i> None of this stuff is in &quot;Twisted Core&quot; any more, however, the chat
</I>&gt;<i> stuff is all in Twisted Words
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/words">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/words</A>) and domish is in Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> Xish (<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/xish">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/xish</A>). This split is to help
</I>&gt;<i> us remain agile in project management / release / development, so I
</I>&gt;<i> urge you not to look on it as a bad thing. Being pulled out of the
</I>&gt;<i> core is probably going to *help* you. And 2.0 is going to be released
</I>&gt;<i> any day now (I was going to release the third prerelease today, but
</I>&gt;<i> ran into a bug. It'll go out tomorrow. The actual release will go out
</I>&gt;<i> shortly afterward).
</I>
No no!  I don't look at it as a bad thing at all!  I think it's great! 
All I'm saying is I don't want to have to tell people to pull SVN releases
of anything.  Just &quot;pull X official release&quot;, even of X official release
is &quot;pull words, core, and XXXXXXX&quot;.  I also believe I misunderstood my
original conversation about oscar.py, I ended up thinking that oscar.py
wasn't long for your dists at all.  Dooh!  =)

&gt;&gt;<i> Would it help if I popped in the irc chatroom for a bit to discuss these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things 'in person'?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not a bad idea.
</I>
I've popped on there for the time being.  (though my attention isn't
entirely on that screen)

Do you all have any interest in my changes for oscar at some point . . .
or interest in me simply maintaining that particular module?  I have to
beat on it all the time so it's not like I don't have a vested interest in
making it be right.  ;)  No worries if that's not cool.

Daniel
