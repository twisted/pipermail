I think I'll just remove that warning. It's warning about a situation 
which I believe *may* never actually be able to happen: during final 
connection shutdown, the socket is reported writable, but OpenSSL is 
for some reason unable to write the final packet. I looked through the 
code, and while I wasn't able to convince myself it couldn't happen, I 
did convince myself that it was rather unlikely, at least. If that does 
happen somehow, (and you aren't using &quot;0.XX&quot; of pyOpenSSL), twisted has 
no way of ever finding out. Thus the warning telling you to upgrade.

About the &quot;0.XX&quot;: Back around the beginning of November, I sent some 
patches to the maintainer of PyOpenSSL to add the requisite new method 
to it. While he responded in the affirmative that the patches were 
good, there has been no activity since then. Thus the lack of a real 
version number.
