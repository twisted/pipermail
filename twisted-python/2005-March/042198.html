Yeah, that'd be me. I sort of wrote half an mDNS responder, posted it 
to the list, and got little to no feedback or interest.

I forget where I uploaded it last time, but for now, I've uploaded it 
again:

&gt;<i> I wanted to make sure I was not re-inventing the wheel before I start

</I>
The main reason I gave up and moved on was that I didn't have any real 
*need* for a ZeroConf implementation, I just thought it'd be neat to 
write. The second reason I gave up was that apparently only one process 
on a host can bind to a multicast UDP socket at a time, which means 
only one ZeroConf implementation per machine. Since I don't have easy 
access to any Linux boxes at the moment and my main home PC is a Mac 
G5, that makes development rather difficult.

The Right Solution, as far as I can see, would be to take Apple's 
ZeroConf implementation (Available for Linux under the Apple Public 
Source License), give it a pretty Python wrapper, and somehow integrate 
that with Twisted. That gives your application an extra dependency, but 
as ZeroConf gets more popular, your app becomes *less* likely to break, 
instead of *more*.
