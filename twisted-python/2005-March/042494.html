<PRE>The lack of detailed, current documentation for Twisted is an ongoing 
problem, especially given how revolutionary and difficult to understand 
its underlying programming concepts are.  Dave Cook's &quot;just use it for 
months&quot; comment is not at all off the mark, but it's a frustrating and 
unproductive way to learn.  It particularly annoys me that the code 
contains so few docstrings -- Python's especially useful and convenient 
way to document your code -- and there are so many nonsensical &quot;cute&quot; 
names like jelly, banana, etc.

Putting my money where my mouth is, I would be willing to contribute a 
few hundred bucks to getting some more docstrings in the code and, 
consequently, to a somewhat better lore-generated API specification.

One thought would be to run a &quot;bounty&quot; program using an 
actively-generated, hyperlinked web rendition of the latest Twisted SVN 
code.  For example, participant donors could mark defs, classes, or 
blocks of code to indicate where they're willing to &quot;sponsor&quot; 
docstrings, and they could also click on newly added docstrings in such 
&quot;sponsored&quot; code portions to indicate acceptance and make a bounty 
payment from their contribution to the fund or whatever to the person 
who wrote the docstring.  The proportion of docstring submissions 
accepted by a given donor could be a score that potential writers could 
look at when deciding whether to do the work or not.

Any thoughts on that idea?  Anyone willing to step up as a 
co-contributor to such an effort, both financially and with some Nevow 
coding?
