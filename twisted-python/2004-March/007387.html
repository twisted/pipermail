I don't know.  I'd like to have a centralized copyright structure so 
that we can move it to a foundation (in the ever-nearer future) but 
that still involves inconvenient paperwork.  Not to mention the fact 
that copyright is the only enforceable form of attribution, and I think 
it's unfair that so many major contributors don't really have a 
signature on Twisted in any significant way.  With BSD-licensed 
software, the possible problems with the license are so small that it 
seems unlikely that disparate copyrights would cause a problem...

I should really talk to a lawyer about this, and to a few key 
contributors.  I have a feeling I already know what some of them are 
going to say ;).  The lawyer I discussed this with last time has moved 
on, and the other intelprop lawyers I know aren't really in this space 
- does anyone know a good (cheap ^_^) lawyer with F/OSS experience who 
has the time to help?
