Yes, this does need to happen.  The code that creates shells, executes
files, and connects to file systems needs to be connected to ISSHUser,
not Session.  Unfortunatly, I can't think of a way to do it that doesn't
seem ugly.  Just adding methods like 'openShell(channel)' to ISSHUser
seems silly when there are many more possibilities of connections for a
Conch server.  There should be a clever way to do this with Interfaces
and Adaptors, but I can't think of it.

&gt;<i> I was hoping that Paul, or someone else may have some thoughts in this

The only thought I had was an LJ post
(<A HREF="http://z3p.livejournal.com/324865.html">http://z3p.livejournal.com/324865.html</A>), but I'm having trouble turning
that idea into code.  Maybe I can convince some Twisted folks at PyCon
to help me out ;)
