ftp isn't robust, either -- the multi-socket aspect of it means it often
breaks in the presence of firewalls.  It also has no agreed standard for
sharing metadata (like modification times or content types?).

&gt;<i> sftp - same as ftp but secure
</I>
That's almost entirely wrong :)

SFTP has very little in common with FTP.  The only similarities I can think
of are that SFTP clients are traditionally presented to look like FTP
clients, and that SFTP has per-session authentication (whereas with e.g.
HTTP you have to re-auth for every request, or at least pass auth
credientials like a session cookie for every request).  As far as I'm aware,
SFTP doesn't have the binary/ascii transfer mode gunk that FTP has, or any
of the nasty seperate data connection sockets issues.

SFTP is massively more secure than FTP, though :)

&gt;<i> smb - secureish, slow over wan, doesn't support resume, great to

</I>
I suspect that you can resume with SMB -- a network filesystem that doesn't
support accessing files in pieces (i.e. seek) is pretty limited.  Most
clients wouldn't expose this functionality, though.

&gt;<i> html - can be secure, slow non robust file transfer, doesn't support 
</I>&gt;<i> resume, easy to administer who has access to what, client access is 
</I>&gt;<i> universal
</I>
(I think you mean HTTP)

What's non-robust about HTTP, compared to FTP?  And it definitely *does*
support resuming downloads -- see the Range header:
    <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.35</A>

&gt;<i> I'm looking at defining a virtual filesystem that can be accessed

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>[...]
&gt;<i>

</I>
I just thought I should correct some misunderstandings about the protocols
you mentioned :)
