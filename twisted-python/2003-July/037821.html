</I>
My problem (besides just having a lot to learn) was that I was writing
the callbacks to use variables that were defined in the loop, thinking I
had no other option besides using results passed by previous callbacks. 
The results that were returned from doSomethingThatReturnsDeferred (and
thus were arguments to the next callback) were needed (not right away,
but I wanted the results to continue being passed down the callback
chain), and I wasn't aware of any other way to get &quot;item&quot; passed to my
callback.  However, I tried using callbackArgs to pass &quot;item&quot; in a tuple,
like this...

     for item in list:
         d.addCallbacks(onSuccess, log.err, callbackArgs=(item,))
         deferreds.append(d)

and then defining onSuccess like...

    def onSuccess(results, args):
        item = args[0]
        d = item.doSomethingElseThatReturnsDeferred()
        return d

Is this an acceptable way to accomplish this?  It is working in my code
but I'd like to do things the right way.

&gt;<i>

</I>
I'm not sure what you mean here.  I was adding my deferred to a list and
it seemed to be doing what I wanted (at least I think it was).

Your help is appreciated.
