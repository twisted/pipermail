I'm pretty sure no one is talking about randomizing...  One solution is a 
fixed interval check and the other is a &quot;as needed&quot; check.  The only ways I 
can imagine that a &quot;as needed&quot; check would be more costly is if the monitors 
were queued very frequently and the controller ended up waking up/sleeping 
very very short intervals or if a huge number of monitors were queued with 
start times far into the future and the controller took a long time to search 
the list for the next pending monitor.  An intelligent insertion routine 
could solve the second issue easily and if a five minute check is sufficient, 
I can't imagine the first issue being a problem...


btw, I couldn't find that doc with a quick look at <A HREF="http://www.nagios.org/.">http://www.nagios.org/.</A>  Do 
you have a direct link 'cause I'm curious regardless :)
