  Ideally, I'd like to see this parsed into a structure resembling this:

    [Header(peek=1, name=1, value=1, ['References', 'X-Ref']), UID()]

  The mailbox implementation should have as little knowledge of IMAP4 as
humanly possible.  The current implementation is an example of the &quot;just
enough to work&quot; philosophy.  parseNestedList was actually hacked pretty
awfully to support this after I initially wrote it, because I'd forgotten
about this particular aspect of the IMAP4 query syntax.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>     [['BODY.PEEK', ['HEADER.FIELDS', ['References', 'X-Ref']]], UID]
</I>&gt;<i> Or something like that, which keeps the body.peek information together.
</I>&gt;<i> (Note that BODY and BODY.PEEK are the only two FETCH args that have a []
</I>&gt;<i> part.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
  It does seem like a slight improvement, but I'm not sure it is significant
enough to merit a stop in the API roadmap.  On the other hand, if you're
willing to implement it... ;)


&gt;<i> This is both closer to what was requested, and much easier to parse (IMO).

  Parsing the current form isn't so bad.  Here's a snippet from the mailbox
I've written:

        i = 0
        r = {}
        L = len(parts)
        while i &lt; L:
            p = parts[i]
            fn = p.upper().replace('.', '_')
            f = getattr(self, '_fetch_' + fn, None)
            if not f:
                raise NotImplementedError, fn
            if i + 1 &lt; L:
                if isinstance(parts[i + 1], types.ListType):
                    r.update(f(msg, parts[i + 1]))
                    i += 2
                    continue
            r.update(f(msg))
            i += 1
        return r

  The key section of interest here is the isinstance() check (the loop
dispatches actual fetching to methods named like &quot;_fetch_BODY_PEEK&quot; and so
on).  I believe parsing an alternate form that continued to intersperse
lists with strings would be pretty similar, with just a few checks
re-arranged.

  Would you be interested in patching the fetch methods to generate a
structure like the one I described above?  Or if you have another idea for a
parsed query structure that is similarly abstracted away from the protocol,
I'd be glad to entertain it.

  Lastly, I definitely recognize this as a weak point in the IMAP4 code, but
fixing it has not yet become a priority, as I already have a working parser.
