It means that the user interfaces will be branded for the company I work
for.

&gt;<i> &gt; * multiuser 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what this mean either.
</I>
It means there will be more than one user that will use this service.

&gt;<i> &gt; * offer various ways of verifying the uptime and integrity of content on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a site:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     i. Can I open an HTTP connection to this site?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     ii. Is &quot;foo bar&quot; present on the page that I've retrieved?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     iii. Is the page I've retrieved the same size as it was before?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     iv. Is Basic Auth still working with this username/password? (for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     pages that do Basic Auth, of course :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Look at twisted.web.monitor.
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, most of this is fairly easy with Twisted.
</I>
This looks like a useful, albeit minimal, starting point.

&gt;<i> &gt; I write a &quot;monicron&quot;. monicron wakes up every five minutes and asks the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system &quot;are there any monitors that need to be performed right now?&quot; The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answer will either be &quot;Yes, here's the monitors that need to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; performed right now&quot; or &quot;No&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If No, monicron will just go back to bed for another five minutes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If the answer is Yes monicron will gather the monitors that need to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; run, and execute the all at once -- asyncronously. It would then need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; collect the results of all the monitors, and once they've all reported
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; back for a given site, send an error report if something went wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That sounds like the worst impelemntation strategy I could think
</I>&gt;<i> of. Wouldn't it be saner to have each task have its own scheduling?
</I>
Well, you didn't say anything about what specifically seemed bad about
the (very generic description of an) implementation I mentioned, so
there's no point considering other alternatives without having at least
considered the first one.

The metaphor I suggested maps well into the Real World (e.g. think of a
SWAT team that has to enter and &quot;clear&quot; a building; each cell is
deployed to their own piece of the building, but all have to report back
to one central command, otherwise there's no way to know if there's an
&quot;all clear&quot; or not).

&gt;<i> &gt; 2. If Yes, where should I start looking for the bits of the framework
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that will make my task as easy as possible?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Read the documentation?
</I>&gt;<i> Seriously, read all of it. I can't imagine many parts which wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> be relevant.
</I>
Well, there's loads of it that's not relevant to my problem. A more
constructive pointer than &quot;read all of it&quot; would be useful, but I'll
look to more pragmatic sources to find that pointer. :)
