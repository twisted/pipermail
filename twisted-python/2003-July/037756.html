Yes, it was relay control I was looking for.  I have seen some ISPs use SMTP 
AUTH to control relaying, but for our use of an e-mail server it will be fine 
to limit by IP addresses.  (That will also alleviate silly tech support 
issues that would arise from requiring SMTP AUTH :)


&gt;<i> 	Umm, I hope you do mean _authenticated (E)SMTP_, not just
</I>&gt;<i> 	ESMTP? Because the only real difference between SMTP and ESMTP
</I>&gt;<i> 	is whether the client says HELO or EHLO.
</I>
Yes.  Thank you :)  To put what I mentioned in my original e-mail another way, 
I haven't kept my brain up to spec regarding the details of SMTP vs ESMTP and 
where AUTH falls in, as well as related RFCs.  :)


&gt;<i> 	I've said this earlier, and I'll say it again. twisted.mail is
</I>&gt;<i> 	not really ready for production use yet. It can still lose
</I>&gt;<i> 	email.
</I>
That alone tells me that in the short term any efforts to use the existing 
Twisted mail would not be useful, and that I should be researching the use of 
more 'traditional' email server configurations :)

I might have perhaps run across this if I did an extensive search in the 
mailing list archives, but my resource was grepping the Twisted CVS for 
'twisted mail'.  The only thing I ran across that had any depth to its 
description was doc/historic/2002/ipc10/twisted-network-framework/index.html 
and it had no mention of not using Twisted mail in a production environment.

I'm not saying that it's a bad thing that I couldn't find more definitive 
information -- after all if something is not ready for production use then 
it's probably not a good thing to give people lots of easy ways to believe 
that it is :)


&gt;<i> &gt; How would one keep usernames on different domains separate in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  logging in with POP3 and authenticating with ESMTP?  E.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">jdoe at domain1.com</A>&quot; and &quot;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">jdoe at domain2.com</A>&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 	By authenticating as <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">jdoe at domain1.com</A>, not as joe.
</I>
'tis what I tried...

&gt;<i> 	Scalemail is quite close to first real deployment. It uses parts
</I>&gt;<i> 	of twisted.mail. <A HREF="http://scalemail.sf.net/">http://scalemail.sf.net/</A>  (I really need to update
</I>&gt;<i> 	the web site ;)
</I>
I will take a look at this and see what I can glean from it. I see CVS commits 
in the last 2 months, and a 'debian' directory in there, so I'm happy even if 
the website isn't up-to-date :-D

Thanks for the link and the info on the status of Twisted mail!
