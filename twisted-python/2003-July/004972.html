Philippe, I applaud this effort, but I think that you're working on 
something different than what you think you're working on ;-).

twistedmatrix.com is the central distribution site for the software and 
documentation.  That's not to say the site doesn't need help - far from 
it, it definitely needs a new maintainer! - but something authored with 
CMF or Plone is more of a &quot;community&quot; website; this is like the 
distinction between <A HREF="http://starship.python.net/">http://starship.python.net/</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.python.org/.">http://www.python.org/.</A>

I think it might be good to have a separate &quot;User Community&quot; and 
&quot;Developer Community&quot;.  If you launch such a site, I will gladly link 
to it from the front page of twistedmatrix.com.

These mailing lists are appropriate for much of the discussion that has 
happened on them so far, but I do occasionally feel as if the core 
Twisted development team is stifling experimentation outside the bounds 
of our original intentions for the software.

There has been much talk of the &quot;right way&quot; to do things of late.  
While I have strong feelings about what the &quot;right way&quot; is, and a lot 
more design vision than implemented code, having the user community 
veer off on some tangents to see what's possible and what &quot;fits&quot; 
outside the auspices of the central development community might let us 
exchange more fully-formed and coherent ideas.  Right now I feel like 
the discourse is too much like

	Application Author: &quot;Maybe-&quot;
	Developer: &quot;No.&quot;
	Author: &quot;But-&quot;
	Developer: &quot;Sorry.&quot;
	Author: &quot;Oh.&quot;
	Developer: &quot;See?&quot;
	Author: &quot;What's woven.guard?&quot;
	Developer: &quot;ARRRGH&quot; *bang*

If the application authors themselves had a community to discuss ideas 
and present them fully-formed, we might see something more like:

	Author[s]: &quot;Can we include advanced Frobnitz support in Twisted 1.5?&quot;
	Developer: &quot;It's too complicated.&quot;
	Author: &quot;But I have a working implementation and it's only 500 lines 
of Python.&quot;
	Developer: &quot;Oh, maybe that's not so bad.  Would you contribute it?&quot;
	Author: &quot;Sure.  But, what about woven.guard support?&quot;
	Developer: &quot;ARRRRGH&quot; *bang*

And eventually, we can omit the last exchange as some of us have more 
free time to actually document various APIs more clearly.
