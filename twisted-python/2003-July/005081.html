... unless you want, two years from now, to scan a service every five
seconds (bonus points: with exponential back-off) because you have a
fickle customer who needs that sort of reassurance.

Besides, if the jobs all have their own timing mechanism you can spread
them over your five-minute interval. You can also a small random offset to
each timeout, which means that you won't have problems with load spikes
every five minutes which might skew your answer time statistics. Not to
mention that a mostly-idle background job will mostly stay in memory,
while one which sleeps for five minutes may well be swapped out by the
time it runs again.

I respectfully disagree. It's a case of &quot;use the framework the way it's
intended&quot;, which is a skill you'll need in other areas too.

YMMV, but that is very much my experience, with Twisted in particular.
