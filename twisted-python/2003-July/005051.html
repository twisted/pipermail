I understand that SSL doesn't make something secure. I just ment does it
encrypt the data in some way? Etc. I actually just wanted a method of
determining that the machine is who it says it is. And SSL solves that
problem nicely (or some form of PKI.)

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It can run over SSL, yes. listenSSL and getObjectAtSSL work

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Ah. My fault, I didn't see getObjectAtSSL. Sorry.

&gt;<i> &gt; Am I able to reject connections with untrusted SSL certificates? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You'd need to work a little bit for that. I estimate an overhead

</I>&gt;<i> inherit from pb.BrokerFactoy to build your inherited Broker rather
</I>&gt;<i> than pb.Broker]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
OK. Thanks.

&gt;<i> &gt; Am I able to trust certificates programmatically? I want give the client
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a list of servers that are untrusted, and when the user clicks 'Trust',
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the connection is then permitted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is probably an issue of pyOpenSSL, because that's the underlying
</I>&gt;<i> layer for what Twisted uses. You will also probably want to save it
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere: Twisted is somewhat  on this issue. You will need to decide
</I>&gt;<i> where to save. Of course, files work :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is it possible to multicast from server --&gt; n*client? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not with PB. PB is TCP based, multicast is UDP based. Twisted does
</I>&gt;<i> support UDP, but you'll have to build your own layer on top of it.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, you can still use jelly, which is the secure marshaller used
</I>&gt;<i> internally by PB. Of course, UDP is inherently insecure in that
</I>&gt;<i> malicious meddlers can do whatever they want to it [listen in, capture
</I>&gt;<i> packets, etc.] You can, of course, encrypt/sign the jellied packets
</I>&gt;<i> you multicast using packages like pycrypto.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OK. I don't really mean &quot;multicast&quot;. I mean somehow call the same methods
with the same data on a bunch of different &quot;clients&quot; (OK, how do I
describe the non-servers? :-)

Can I do this efficiently? Is there a need to even worry about it?
Should I just:

for connect in connects:
	connect.callRemote(...)
 
&gt;<i> &gt; Can I call methods on the client from the server? (so that the server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can push information to the client asynchronously.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> You should probably convince yourself to stop saying the word &quot;server&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> or &quot;client&quot;. There's little difference between them, except the server
</I>&gt;<i> gives the client an initial object reference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'll try. I don't know how else to describe them. :-)
What I really meant was: can I callRemote from the initial object
reference provider to the ... &quot;client&quot;?
 
&gt;<i> &gt; How's the stability of the GTK2 compatible Perspective Broker code in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Twisted?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's no relationship between GTK2 and PB. GTK2 looks to Twisted like
</I>&gt;<i> a reactor -- basically, something very low-level, pushing the bits.
</I>&gt;<i> Perspective Broker is all protocol-level code, which means it only
</I>&gt;<i> cares someone is pushing the bits. Of course, there are specific GUI
</I>&gt;<i> classes for PB-based authentication, but there is a good chance you
</I>&gt;<i> won't want them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OK. What I really meant (hehe) was: Is the GTK2 reactor code stable?
Should I be aware of any surprises it might present?
Are there examples of usage?
Is calling gtk2reactor.install() all I need to do?
  
&gt;<i> &gt; Has anyone ever attempted to integrate Spread (www.spread.org) with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Twisted and use it as the transport?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not to my knowledge.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
OK. I've only just started looking at Twisted. So some of my questions may
seem rather superfluous. There's a lot in Twisted, and I'm trying to get
my head around it.

Thanks for your help.

Omar Kilani
