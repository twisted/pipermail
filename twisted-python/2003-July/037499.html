  The best solution would seem to be to get PB working with the new cred
code -- which doesn't use Authorizers, Identities, or any of that confusion.

  Here's a simple credentials checker that adds all unrecognized usernames
that are requested (untested):

    from twisted import cred
    import twisted.cred.credentials
    import twisted.cred.checkers
    import twisted.cred.error

    from twisted.python.components import implements

    class LazyCredentialsChecker:
        __implements__ = (cred.checkers.ICredentialsChecker,)

        credentialInterfaces = (cred.credentials.IUsernamePassword,)

        def userExists(self, username):
            # Return true if username exists, false otherwise

        def getPassword(self, username):
            # Implement appropriately

        def addUser(self, username, password):
            # Here, too

        def requestAvatarId(self, creds):
            if implements(creds, cred.credentials.IUsernamePassword):
                if self.userExists(creds.username):
                    if self.getPassword(creds.username) == creds.password:
                        return creds.username
                    raise cred.error.UnauthorizedLogin()
                self.addUser(creds.username, creds.password)
                return creds.username
            raise NotImplementedError()

  An even nicer way to do this would be to create an interface for creating
a new user, (eg, IChargen), have requestAvatarId check for this interface,
and create the required entries in its database, rather than relying on the
non-existence of a username to create a new one (what if the user mistypes
their user?)

  Hope this helps,

  Jp
