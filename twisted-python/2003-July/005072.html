Mentioning callLater makes this an implementation question now, whereas
I believe both Brad and I were talking from a more general point of view.
I was, anyway.  From a general point of view, I'm right ;-), because
you simply don't have to worry about issues related to adding or removing
items, or changing the time delays of them as you would if you calculated
the delay until the next activity and went to sleep for that long.

As for bandwidth: I'm of the &quot;premature optimization is bad&quot; school
of thought, and it's far too early in this discussion to be worrying
about a few microseconds of CPU usage per day...
