I'll name 3 common internet protocols which often in large
enterprises are hooked up to LDAP...

   IMAP, SAMBA, SMTP

Well, I agree here.   But *something* has to fill this role of
orgnization wide directory.  Perhaps a unixy LDAP replacement is 
needed down stream.

</I>|<i> &gt; to mean an object in the LDAP database.

</I>|<i> 	supposed to really ever instantiate them yourself.
</I>
Well, I'd rather see ldap.Entry ... &quot;entry&quot; is far superior
to &quot;object&quot;.   You don't call a tuple returned by the database
an &quot;object&quot;, you call it a &quot;row&quot; (not an ODBCRow).  There 
really isn't a 1-1 correspondence between object and 
LDAP's entry.

</I>|<i> &gt;         1.  state machine

</I>|<i> &gt;              ldaptor.protocols.ldap3.server
</I>|<i> &gt;       
</I>|<i> &gt;         2. wire format
</I>|<i> &gt; 
</I>|<i> &gt;              ldaptor.protocols.ldap3.wire.ber
</I>|<i> &gt;              ldaptor.protocols.ldap3.wire.request
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> 	Pureber and pureldap should be applicable to all LDAP versions

</I>
    ldaptor.protocols.wire.ber
    ldaptor.protocols.wire.request

</I>
Assume for a moment that a foundation (similar to Apache) is
formed for Twisted.   What characteristics of this organization
are required for you to be 'comfortable' with the code being
donated?

|<i> 	Let me repeat myself. If installing one library is too
</I>|<i> 	much effort for you, you are using the wrong OS.
</I>
I'd rather not have twisted require a package management
service to download all the third party components necessary.

Best,

Clark
