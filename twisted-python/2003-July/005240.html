The whole point of those discussions has generally been that the 
current structure is important to make relicensing a possibility :-).

While twisted as a whole is being very actively (one might even say 
&quot;agressively&quot;) developed, some portions of the framework, like the core 
reactor, seem to be extremely stable at this point.

(Please, chime in if you disagree.)

I have been considering approaching the Python team to ask about 
relicensing / including portions of twisted.internet in core Python at 
some point, since it seems to have eclipsed asyncore in terms of 
popularity, but I am sure that such discussions would be fraught with 
subtle corner cases and versioning issues, and I am very, very short on 
time at the moment.  However, if another member of the Twisted team 
would like to take up this discussion, either about core Python or 
about Zope 3, I'd be more than willing to appoint a proxy.
