While I agree that it's better to use a component on the resource than 
to randomly set a junk attribute, I'd also like to caution against 
using this too much.  Unless you're doing something like computing 
relative links, it's a lot safer and less surprising to explicitly pass 
references around in your application.  This might involve more typing, 
but trying to &quot;throw&quot; objects to other parts of your application, using 
the registry, the Componentized request, or the session makes it 
dependent upon an execution context.  That context is often present, 
but it's an undeclared requirement, so it can be a very surprising 
impediment to using a particular kind of resource from some other code 
that does a related but not identical thing.
