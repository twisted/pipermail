That's why I putted the logo twisted powered in footer. I'd love to see
some apps running on such website.


&gt;<i> Please understand, I am not trying to belittle Twisted in any way, but

</I>
There's no -- known -- success story about twisted. I saw Issues, but
it's maybe the only plugin / product / app which is not deprecated.

You shouldn't forget that Twisted has not only developers, but USERS too
! The current website and mailing are designed for developers, not users
(which is a good starting point btw).

&gt;<i> Reinventing the wheel that is Plone is by no means a trivial task, yet 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that moving to a solution that is not powered by Twisted 
</I>&gt;<i> would be a very bad move in terms of public relations.  Of course, 
</I>&gt;<i> writing a bridge layer to make Plone run on top of Twisted would be 
</I>&gt;<i> really cool, too.  Insane, maybe, but cool.  ;)
</I>
I agree, that would be great. Now, we don't have known products. Making
such a bridge would be too much efforts.

We really need some working exemple, some uptodate apps that show how to
use Twisted.

Plone would help us to set a dynamic community, and that the only point
I see. Twisted.web is not designed to make content management
applications, so please let zope and plone do their job.

&gt;<i> For what it might be worth, I would suggest using Twisted in all areas 
</I>&gt;<i> that you possibly can.  For instance, Twisted has an NNTP server.  So, 
</I>&gt;<i> why aren't we (or are we, I don't know?) mirroring this mailing list as 
</I>&gt;<i> a newsgroup?  Stuff like this provides great advertising opportunities.
</I>
Would be a good idea. New users don't use the mailing list just to give
twisted a shot. They are often disappointed by the lack of uptodate docs
and exemples.



(sorry for my english)
