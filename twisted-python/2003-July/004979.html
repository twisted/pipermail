<PRE>I have some questions which seem to be related to this.

I have a webserver which serves as a newsaggregator etc. Once a while a
&quot;worker&quot; ( being a thread or not ) must go out and collect, parse and store
new items served by rss/rdf-feeds from around the net. Using a
SQLite-database which takes one connect at the time, at least as I
understand it, using threads could pose a serious problem if do-able at all.
I have another &quot;worker&quot; collecting information about files in given folders,
generating sha1-checksums etc. which is *very*  time consuming on large
amounts of data. This info must also go into the database.

So far I got the code that schedules a call and re-schedules it after the
call has finished. But the method that's called is blocking and has to be
re-written using deferreds or threads or something.

&lt;dream-mode value=&quot;on&quot; requirements=&quot;stupidity filter&quot;&gt;
The utlimate goal would be to have some way of letting the user easily and
quickly define new workers doing user-defined things without hoggin the
server and by using as little as possible of strange, weird, technical,
complicated Twisted-things like deferreds, callbacks, threads etc.

My question is; is there a generic way to make old-style blocking Python
code twisted-friendly non-blocking using deferToThread or deferreds wrapped
around it?
&lt;/dream-mode&gt;

I'm going to look into tnntprss.py which was mentioned yesterday or
something on the lists, which does some of the things I need, but any
example on how to go about this would be nice.

PS! Another question; should these workers be located in an
ApplicationService-subclass?

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;What I would like to do is a type of server that will serve a number of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Answer: *
</I>&gt;<i> Network clients and servers in Twisted are pretty easy, and its very good

</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/clients">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/clients</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Being a server and a client at once is as easy as:

</I>&gt;<i>     reactor.connectTCP('host', 4321, MyClientFactory())

</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/threading">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/threading</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The key tool you probably want to use when working with threads is
</I>&gt;<i> twisted.internet.threads.deferToThread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, be aware that threads aren't necessarily the only solution to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;time-consuming tasks&quot;, although it would help to know what these tasks
</I>&gt;<i> actually are :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Question: *
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;...and database related tasks&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Answer: *
</I>&gt;<i> The twisted.enterprise package has support for using standard Python
</I>DB-API
&gt;<i> 2.0 compliant modules.  You probably just want to use
</I>&gt;<i> twisted.enterprise.adbapi, which is described here:
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/enterprise">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/enterprise</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That document is a little out of date, unfortunately -- it doesn't mention
</I>&gt;<i> that you can avoid adbapi.Augmentation if you don't like that approach,
</I>and
&gt;<i> just use adbapi.ConnectionPool directly, although the its API is fairly
</I>ugly
&gt;<i> and not very Twisted-like.  That module could probably do with an
</I>overhaul,
&gt;<i> but that's not your problem ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope I've helped at least a little.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
