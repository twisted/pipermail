IUsernameHashedPassword, I believe.  It got added after I wrote this and
whinged to Jp, iirc ;)

Regardless, UsernamePasswordWrapper has its credentials checker class
hardcoded to UsernamePassword (which implements IUsernamePassword) in a
nested function in the middle of a forty-line function, so it's still rather
useless to me.  It might be nice if that aspect of UsernamePasswordWrapper
was parameterised...

UsernamePasswordWrapper also assumes form-based authentication, if I'm
understanding correctly.  I'm not hugely wedded to HTTP basic auth, but it
is useful for some things, so it would be nice if UPW was able to return
something other than form.FormProcessor in the &quot;INIT_PERSPECTIVE&quot; case (and
I'm not certain I like the login URL being hard-coded... 'perspective-init'
strikes me as an implementation detail, like '.html' or '.asp', that users
shouldn't have to see -- 'login' would make more sense to most people).

Anyway, it was clear to me that the existing stable version of Twisted
couldn't support what I needed via guard, which is why I took the route I
did.  If someone who understands this stuff wants to incorporate htpasswd
and/or HTTP basic auth in such a way that I can use it from guard, I won't
complain :)
