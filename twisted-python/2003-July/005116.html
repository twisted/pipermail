<PRE>Hello, twisted users!

I'm newbie to twisted and after reading documentation feel somewhat a 
little bit confused, don't know where to start.
Can you give an advice on the following:

I need to have a server and a GUI client(wxpython), which communicates 
using ssl.
Server:
    - it should take requests for establishing connection from a lot of 
GUI clients using ssl
    - the request for connection method will pass to server simple types 
(strings and dicts)
    - server will ask radius  server if such user exists, and if so then 
it writes some info to database(MySQL) and adds some rules to firewall. 
If such user doesn't exist in radius, then it raises exception to remote 
client or just return error code.
    - If client succeded in connection, then server should every 3 
minutes call method 'checkpoint' on client. If it doesn't receive 
response from client, it deletes rules from firewall and writes some 
info to database.

Client:
     - wxpython gui based client, that tries to connect to remote server 
using ssl(Connection means connecting to some port on the server, 
passing parameters to remote method 'connect' and if there is no 
exception or return code == 1, connection is successfull and message 
printed to happy user).
     - client contains method that will be periodically(each 3 minutes) 
called by server after successful connection

I just don't know where to start. Should client implement Root.pb as 
from Chapter 5(Perspective broker), so that it can pass reference to 
server and server can call methods on it or maybe i need implement some 
protocol? And how ssl fits in all this? Is it high-level or low-level 
twisted to impelemt features i've described?
Thanks in advance.
Your help is very, very appreciated.

Best regards,
Ruslan
