I'm not sure what this mean either.

Look at twisted.web.monitor.
Basically, most of this is fairly easy with Twisted.

&gt;<i> I write a &quot;monicron&quot;. monicron wakes up every five minutes and asks the
</I>&gt;<i> system &quot;are there any monitors that need to be performed right now?&quot; The
</I>&gt;<i> answer will either be &quot;Yes, here's the monitors that need to be
</I>&gt;<i> performed right now&quot; or &quot;No&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If No, monicron will just go back to bed for another five minutes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the answer is Yes monicron will gather the monitors that need to be
</I>&gt;<i> run, and execute the all at once -- asyncronously. It would then need to
</I>&gt;<i> collect the results of all the monitors, and once they've all reported
</I>&gt;<i> back for a given site, send an error report if something went wrong.
</I>
That sounds like the worst impelemntation strategy I could think
of. Wouldn't it be saner to have each task have its own scheduling?

&gt;<i> 2. If Yes, where should I start looking for the bits of the framework
</I>&gt;<i> that will make my task as easy as possible?
</I>
Read the documentation?
Seriously, read all of it. I can't imagine many parts which wouldn't
be relevant.
