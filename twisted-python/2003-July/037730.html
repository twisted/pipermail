	Well, the UI won't really freeze; self.transport.write()
	will just buffer that 2MB inside the transport, and send
	from the buffer whenever the socket is ready.

	Of course, 2MB is quite a lot to buffer, and 100MB would
	be insane in a &quot;normal&quot; application. That's why, when you have
	lots of data, you use the producer/consumer pattern. See
	twisted.internet.interfaces classes IConsumer, IProducer and
	friends; though they are quite rarely used in normal apps,
	and you won't likely ever need them.

	There's no such thing as &quot;easy complex&quot;. That's why protocol and
	application designers should avoid design decision that require
	complex code to support.

	However, for the easy cases, it goes something like this:

	1. simplest: single process, single protocol chat
	2. quite easy: asynchronous single process, many protocol chats
	3. starts as easy and explodes later: threads, many protocol chats

	Asynchronous programming removes most the time-related
	variance in program behaviour; that is, it helps you write
	more predictable code (very few race conditions compared to
	threads). And when you get used to it, the state machine
	thinking is just nice.

&gt;<i> I've written various C programs using select() and have a good idea

</I>
	Twisted actually removes most of the pitfalls you fight with
	when doing your own event loop from scratch; that's the main
	reason to use Twisted for me. Of course, the bundled protocols
	etc. are nice, too.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Now, I'm assuming that these problems do not actually exist.  Yet I

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hope I've shed some light for you -- let us know if you need more :)
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks -- all I need now is a small flashlight :-)
</I>
	We could always get some rags and lighter fluid, and make torches
	from our cluesticks ;)


/me notes he writes too much drivel. Blame it one the sunday morning.
