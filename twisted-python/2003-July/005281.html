For most client-ish things, it's just not appropriate.  I wish it could 
be, but the vaguaries of GUI development prevent it :).

The case where it's useful is when &quot;deployment&quot; is a separate task from 
&quot;installation&quot; - for offlineimap, I don't gather that this is the case.

</I>
The general idea behind twistd is that it's a unix-centric way of 
managing Twisted services.  It's a daemon.  For an application like 
this, you don't want a daemon, because in at least some circumstances, 
you don't want to daemonize :-).

In general I think that trying to present a programmatic interface to 
twistd is a waste of time.  There should be different service-managing 
programs for different operating systems, and suggesting front-ends to 
twistd will instantly destroy that kind of portability.
