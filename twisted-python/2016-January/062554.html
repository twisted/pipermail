<PRE>So expanding on the &quot;Should the CFFI wrapper and functions for win32 be a
separate project&quot; thread from six months ago I think I'd like some
feedback.  The pywincffi &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/opalmer/pywincffi">https://github.com/opalmer/pywincffi</A>&gt; project,
which I'm planning to use to start replacing pywin32 in Twisted, is getting
close to its first release.  At this point there's enough code in place
that it could probably be used to replace pywin32 in
twisted.python.lockfile and other parts of pywin32 in Twisted.  Before
proposing any patches however, I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome
feedback from people on this list.  Although pywincffi will not be a
'Twisted project' Twisted will be the primary consumer of pywincffi so I'd
like to make sure developers here are happy with the direction that has
been taken.

For some background, the core objectives and intended design features are
below (nothing all that special mostly):

* It should be easy to build and retrieve the binary files (wheels for now,
easy to add more later).
* Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.x are supported from a single code base.
* Type conversion, error checking and other 'C like' code should be the
responsibility of the library where possible.
* APIs provided by pywincffi should mirror their Windows counterparts as
closely as possible so the MSDN documentation can be more easily used as
reference.
* For contributors, it should be possible to work on any platform.  It
should also be possible to contribute without having to manually build a VM.
* For consumers, documentation and error messages should be descriptive,
consistent, complete and accessible.  Examples should be provided for more
complex use cases.

&gt;<i>From a functionality and design standpoint, I think the above are more or
</I>less achieved and can be maintained going forward.  With that in mind, I'd
like to know if anyone here has other ideas that they believe should be
incorporated.  Of course if anyone happens to look at the code and find
functional issues with it now would be a good time to address those issues
too.

Thanks in advance for the help!
