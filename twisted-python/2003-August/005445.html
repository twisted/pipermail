</I>
I would question this. I have used a few systems that used redirects to
perform logins (via Apache, Resin) and I have yet to find a browser in
which this was an issue. Do you know specifically which ones?

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; session?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It should happen automatically.  Isn't it?
</I>
No it doesn't, which is an issue. I perform an /xxx/yyy, and I get the
page with no cookie set or placed in the URL.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also noted a page talking about sandbox and pathargs, and : separated

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is available in sandbox/cce/pathargs.py .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What I am looking to do at the end is support sessioning whether or not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cookies are being allowed, and to allow URLs to be taken.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;allow URLs to be taken&quot;?  Say again?
</I>
Sorry, &quot;allow URLs to be bookmarked&quot;. I am trying to ensure that if a
person bookmarks a URL, that the next time they come in, they are
sessioned properly and that they will be logged in properly.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Question 3: I assume that all of this works similarly for perspective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wrappers? I was trying one Guard example I found on the net, and I am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having trouble actually causing the login page to appear (basically, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using the &quot;perspective-init&quot; in the URL, and I seem to get some other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; page with three input fields, rather than the supposedly specified
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; login
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; page).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PerspectiveWrapper is old, dying code.  Use the (badly-named)
</I>&gt;<i> UsernamePasswordWrapper.  An example is in sandbox/glyph/dynademo/ .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Aside Question: Is there a way to setup default error pages? I checked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How To's and looked in the archives for a simple example, and couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; find any.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, but this is in the bugtracker:

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/users/roundup.twistd/twisted/issue135">http://www.twistedmatrix.com/users/roundup.twistd/twisted/issue135</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some patches are available.
</I>
The above seems to be a problem related to a &quot;if I cannot find the next
piece here through getChild, what do I do now?&quot;. Is there a possibility
of a model such as, &quot;cannot do this, call my parent object in some manner
and tell it to deal with the issue&quot;? Basically, a model with some
form of exception (&quot;I did not return a fragment, but rather an issue&quot;) or
a callback (&quot;yeah, you wanted me to do something, and I can't, so you deal
with it&quot;)?

In this way, the root object could have a &quot;if a page cannot be found for
any reason, then do the following&quot;, and this could be overridden at each
level if desired.

Not sure if this follows the Twisted way of things.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the dearth of documentation here.  The folks responsible for
</I>&gt;<i> these bits of code have been very busy lately :)
</I>
No probs. I understand extreme development. I figure with a mixture of
hacking snippets up to experiment, and hopefully answers to some of my
not-so-brilliant questions, that I can muddle through this evaluation.

Regards!
Ed
