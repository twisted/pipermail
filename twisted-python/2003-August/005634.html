We shouldn't swallow errors in these situations.  If it's a security 
risk, provide a way for the server administrator to turn it off, but 
this is a _bad_ default.

If you doubt the wisdom of making this default, please consult any 
number of Perl FAQs of the form:

	Q. &quot;I wrote a CGI and it works perfectly, but now I moved it to 
another server and I get nothing but a &quot;500 Internal Server Error&quot; 
page.  How do I tell what went wrong!?!?!?&quot;

	A. Look in your apache logs.

	---

	Q. &quot;I looked at my apache logs and nothing makes sense!  How do I tell 
what the error was??!&quot;

	A. ...

Also, could you clarify the security risk of displaying stderr from CGI 
scripts?  I've never heard of a CGI that puts security-critical 
information on stderr rather than stdout and makes it a risk to display 
to users.
