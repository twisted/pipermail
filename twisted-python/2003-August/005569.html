Honestly, I don't care which cred I use, I just want to get something working.  
I chose new cred only because webhappyrealm.py was available too look at.  If 
new cred is too unstable, I'll happily use old cred - if I can ever figure 
out how to get it to work.

Anyway I updated to the latest alpha (1.0.7aplha4) and webhappyrealm.py still 
failed (even worse as I was unable to access /site2 either).

&gt;<i> Also, please check out Quotient (www.divmod.org) for a more complete
</I>&gt;<i> example.

They require Python 2.3.  Unfortunately, because I'm using gentoo, it will be 
a real pain in the ass to upgrade.  I'll certainly take a look at the source 
code though.  Thanks.
