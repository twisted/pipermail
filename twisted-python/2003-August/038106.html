The problem with twistedmatrix.com is that it is currently hosted on
768kbit/sec SDSL...

&gt;<i>

</I>
Woven's API is approaching stability. LivePage is currently the only
portion of the API which will still be changing significantly, and it is
possible to make complex apps without even knowing what LivePage is.

&gt;<i>  - Good HTML / XHTML support
</I>
Woven templates are XML and woven itself outputs XML.

&gt;<i>  - Scales to multiple web servers / load balancing
</I>
Whether this works is really up to how you design your app. Is your 
back-end
data store designed to support scaling across multiple machines?

</I>
Apache will be faster for serving static files because that is what it 
is designed
for; twisted + woven will be faster for large, very complex, very 
dynamic web
applications because that is what it is designed for. Really, the 
biggest
increase you will see is in programmer and designer productivity; woven
is engineered to cleanly separate the template from the code so that 
skinning
becomes trivial; and to support compositing of small components into 
large,
complex components so that your programmers focus on the functionality
of the app, not the complexities inherit in generating HTML and handling
form input.
