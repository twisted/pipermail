&gt;<i> - check that there are no more scheduled events that need to be run *in
</I>&gt;<i>   this iteration*.  It *won't* pull anything off the delayed call queue
</I>&gt;<i>   that wasn't there before it started processing delayed calls.  Let's
</I>&gt;<i>   assume there's nothing else to do here.  [I'm guessing this is the bit
</I>&gt;<i>   you weren't getting, but I'll tell complete story anyway, just in case]
</I>&gt;<i> - then the reactor will finish that iteration, so it'll start a new one.
</I>&gt;<i> - it'll peek at the first thing on the delayed call queue, to see how
</I>&gt;<i>   long until something needs to be called
</I>&gt;<i> - it will then check for IO events using select (or poll, or kqueue, or
</I>&gt;<i>   ...).  It passes the time to the next event as the timeout for the
</I>&gt;<i>   select call, so if there's been no unprocessed network activity since
</I>&gt;<i>   the last   iteration, it will block until that timeout, or there is
</I>&gt;<i>   some activity (which ever happens first).
</I>&gt;<i> - If there's any IO events to be processed, it calls the relevant event
</I>&gt;<i>   handlers.  In my example above, perhaps a message from a client just
</I>&gt;<i>   arrived, this will lead (via a few layers of abstraction) to a
</I>&gt;<i>   protocol's dataReceived method being called (which in turn may call a
</I>&gt;<i>   'messageReceived' handler and spawn a database query, or something).
</I>&gt;<i> - After the IO events have been processed, it will finally turn its
</I>&gt;<i>   attention back to the delayed call queue, find all of them that are now
</I>&gt;<i>   due, and run those.
</I>&gt;<i> - And then the next reactor iteration will happen.
</I>
So, the reactor goes back and forth between the select and the call queue at
each iteration, that's what I was overlooking.


&gt;<i> I hope I've made things clearer, rather than just confusing them :)

Yes, you've been most helpful, thanks.

&quot;Unlike some other scripting languages, Python syntax tends to be in
words rather than typographical syntax - it's very unlikely you'll be
writing lines of code that look like comic book curse words. As a result,
when you have to come back to your code six months later, odds are you
will still be able to understand it.&quot;  Samuele Pedroni and Noel Rappin
