There are a couple of different use-cases here that need to be 
separated; for example, shutting down an active thread pool requires 
waiting, otherwise you will deadlock - and yes, this is due to the fact 
that OS threads are a basically flawed concept, but we've been over 
that one before :).

Sometimes it's also useful to be able to send out a descriptive message 
before dying, like, &quot;The service is going down!  Please hurry up.&quot;  I 
admit that the deferred-from-stopService is probably not the best way 
to handle this, though; there should be a different canonical way to 
shut down a Twisted server that allows those sorts of messages to be 
sent.

However, as long as the deferred in the latter case always comes with 
the timeout, I think the use cases are about equivalent.  Thoughts?
