<PRE>Thanks dp,

&gt;&gt;<i> It seems the twistedmatrix.com website tends to be pretty slow.
</I>&gt;<i>The problem with twistedmatrix.com is that it is currently hosted on
</I>&gt;<i>768kbit/sec SDSL...
</I>
Ok - makes sense.

&gt;&gt;<i> Is Twisted + Woven ready for production web apps?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - Is Woven API stable?
</I>&gt;<i>Woven's API is approaching stability. LivePage is currently the only
</I>&gt;<i>portion of the API which will still be changing significantly,
</I>&gt;<i>and it is
</I>&gt;<i>possible to make complex apps without even knowing what LivePage is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  - Good HTML / XHTML support
</I>&gt;<i>Woven templates are XML and woven itself outputs XML.
</I>
Is there anyone doing XSLT in Twisted? Any xml comparison to say 4suite?

&gt;&gt;<i>  - Scales to multiple web servers / load balancing
</I>&gt;<i>Whether this works is really up to how you design your app. Is your
</I>&gt;<i>back-end data store designed to support scaling across multiple machines?
</I>
I was thinking in comparison to using Apache loadbalancing - mod_proxy?

&gt;<i>Apache will be faster for serving static files because that is what it
</I>&gt;<i>is designed
</I>&gt;<i>for; twisted + woven will be faster for large, very complex, very
</I>&gt;<i>dynamic web
</I>&gt;<i>applications because that is what it is designed for. Really, the
</I>&gt;<i>biggest increase you will see is in programmer and designer productivity;
</I>woven
&gt;<i>is engineered to cleanly separate the template from the code so that
</I>&gt;<i>skinning becomes trivial; and to support compositing of small components
</I>into
&gt;<i>large, complex components so that your programmers focus on the
</I>functionality
&gt;<i>of the app, not the complexities inherit in generating HTML and handling
</I>form input.

How would you compare getting web programmers up to speed on twisted vs with
.Net, webware, and zope.

My impression with zope seems to have everything, but also a mess.

Developed using .Net - pretty easy, but buggy.

Webware, seems simple and has a similar clean style to twisted. But, twisted
seems more capable / flexible.

Richard
