I don't think so, but there isn't any reason why you can't use the 
4suite modules (they're in python, right?).

</I>
Theoretically, you would want to do backend load balancing with Twisted 
in a different way, because it has really convenient ways to talk over 
a network (perspective broker, primarily).  If you're just doing round 
robin load balancing or something you might as well use squid on the 
front end or something of that sort.  Unless the application is CPU 
dependent you can probably get away with one or more squid servers and 
a single Twisted server.  It's been a long time since I've seen a site 
/ load that really crawls because of CPU reasons though, it's usually 
the database's fault or just a bandwidth issue.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apache will be faster for serving static files because that is what it

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for; twisted + woven will be faster for large, very complex, very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dynamic web
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applications because that is what it is designed for. Really, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> biggest increase you will see is in programmer and designer 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> productivity;
</I>&gt;<i> woven
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is engineered to cleanly separate the template from the code so that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> skinning becomes trivial; and to support compositing of small 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> components

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> large, complex components so that your programmers focus on the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the app, not the complexities inherit in generating HTML and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handling
</I>&gt;<i> form input.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How would you compare getting web programmers up to speed on twisted 
</I>&gt;<i> vs with
</I>&gt;<i> .Net, webware, and zope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My impression with zope seems to have everything, but also a mess.
</I>
I couldn't really find a reason to use Zope, unless it was just to make 
a Plone site ;)  I tried though, but it's just too awkward for me.  
Maybe someone who wasn't used to programming &quot;real&quot; python would have a 
better time with Zope.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Developed using .Net - pretty easy, but buggy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
C# is probably one of the most painful web languages I've ever 
developed with for oh so many reasons.   Microsoft really designed some 
horrible to use APIs.  They all seem pretty much ok theoretically, but 
the syntax you end up writing is god awful and long.

&gt;<i> Webware, seems simple and has a similar clean style to twisted. But, 
</I>&gt;<i> twisted
</I>&gt;<i> seems more capable / flexible.
</I>
No experience with it..
