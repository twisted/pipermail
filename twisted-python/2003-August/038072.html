If you are using new cred, please upgrade to the latest alpha.  (There 
should be another one coming out tonight.)  It is new code, and while 
the core isn't changing very much, a lot of other systems that use it 
are being updated, and new examples are being added.

Also, please check out Quotient (www.divmod.org) for a more complete 
example.

I have noticed that about 1/3 of the traffic on this mailing list is 
now &quot;I am trying to understand  cred (usually in the context of 
woven.guard) and the docs seem incomplete.  Help!&quot;.  It's is my fault 
that it's so badly documented, and I am duly apologetic, but I simply 
don't have the time to fix this in the near term, and we need a 
solution in the near term.

Thankfully, Travis has agreed to take over the issue for me for a 
while.  I'd like it if some of you that are having problems with the 
state of the documentation could coordinate with him to produce a 
sensible tutorial (and probably some patches to guard!) that will 
reduce the future volume of these questions :)
