Hi,

I&#146;m currently evaluating &#145;Twisted&#146; to make cross-platform network developments.

The targeted OS are: Win32 (W2K and above), Linux. More Unix flavors would have 
to be supported later on.

&gt;<i>From what I&#146;ve read about &#145;Twisted&#146;, it should work on those platforms as it is 
</I>python-based. Could you confirm that my own .py scripts will run as-is under 
those different platforms (provided I myself don&#146;t use platform-specific 
features of course) ?

I will need to implement the ping protocol (client side), and most probably 
also the traceroute &#145;protocol&#146;. I didn&#146;t see those protocols in the doc, but 
would it be possible to implement them with Twisted ? I saw some classes 
related to raw sockets, so I&#146;m confident it should be manageable. I would like 
some confirmations it&#146;s possible and &#145;cross-platform&#146;ly.

Note: for traceroute, the TTL of the packet has to be set with each packet: 
with the socket API, you can use a setsockopt() call to set it, I don&#146;t know 
how it is managed (if it is) with Twisted. Another way would be to build our 
own IP packet, so that we can set the TTL field.

If answers to those questions are positive, then you may have won a new twisted 
user :).

Thanks for any reply.
