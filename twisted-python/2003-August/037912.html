You can look in widgets.py to see what basic widgets are available. 
view=&quot;None&quot; is aliased to DefaultWidget by the view-lookup machinery. 
You can see by the volume of code in Widget vs. DefaultWidget that 
widget is a lot more functional. DefaultWidget is supposed to exist 
only to minimize the amount of processing that happens on Widgets that 
aren't doing any work. DefaultWidget doesn't know a thing about 
deferreds but Widget does, which is why you had your problem.

I consider it a bug that you had to say view=&quot;Widget&quot; in your case; 
normally you shouldn't be required to know about implementation details 
of Widgets in order to get deferred-model support to work.

Someone could even file a bug which says something like &quot;DefaultWidget 
needs to know about Deferreds&quot;
