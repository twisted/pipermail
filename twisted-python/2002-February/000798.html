It's not &quot;slightly more typing&quot;, it's a massive blow to the elegance and
transparency of spreadable object code.  I guess you're saying that the
transparancy has become a liability, as you can't necessarily tell if
you're invoking a local or remote object (...but I thought that was the
point?).  I'm also a little suprised because this is the first time I've
seen you vouch for any sort of &quot;safety&quot; mechanism to protect the
programmer from doing wayward things with eir data.

It also sounds like that this use case is inherently insecure.  You're
passing privledged information to
some-object-passed-to-you-from-who-knows-what.  I'm not sure there's
really anything you can do about that.
