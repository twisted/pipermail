</I>
Does that provide enough flexibility?  Your possible configurations
would be limited by the things the server can think of.  That means you
probably can't program a configuration like &quot;If it's during working
hours and I don't have anything scheduled on my appointment calander and
I don't have a personal chat session with Cindy open and I'm not
listening to my deth metal playlist, then let Ross see my status as
'available'.&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt; There's no way for a Words client to determine the online status of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another Participant without adding that person to their contact list. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let the user-who-is-being-queried specify how they want this to be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; More user information.  Should a Words client be able to look up another

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, let the client specify.
</I>
Ok, that at least means &quot;Yes, we need to add this to Participant's
remote interface&quot; for each of those features.

&gt;<i> OK, I'm noticing a pattern here. This &quot;capabilities&quot; issue has been
</I>&gt;<i> popping up a *lot* recently, so maybe some sort of generalized
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;capability system&quot; might crop up out of this (ie, a way to grant or
</I>&gt;<i> deny capabilities between perspectives (or identities?)). something to
</I>&gt;<i> think about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Server descriptions.  The best I've seen is something like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; self.service.serviceName, which in practice always yields
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;twisted.words&quot;.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure where you're going with this point,
</I>
I just want to stop seeing &quot;welcome to twisted.quux&quot; on whatever service
I sign on to, and instead see something that identifies whose service
I'm connected using.

&gt;<i> I *definitely* don't want to allow clients to get IPs of other clients
</I>&gt;<i> without explicit consent. After living on dalnet for a few years, where
</I>&gt;<i> kiddies DDoS you for looking at them the wrong way, I've been locked
</I>&gt;<i> into this opinion.
</I>
You're right about client IPs, I think.  There are only two reasons
those are useful on IRC.  1) to help identify the user, which you have a
hard time doing due to IRC's non-existant authentication 2) DoS
attacks.  Since we'll actually have authentication, reason #1 goes away.

&gt;<i> And the server thing - I don't see any harm, but why
</I>&gt;<i> does it matter?
</I>
I can think of two reasons for publishing the server address.  One is
for advertising, you might be thinking &quot;Gee, my server sucks.  What are
other people using?&quot;  The other might be to help track down problems. 
&quot;That server is administered really poorly.  Lets add it to our
blacklist.&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt; Away messages and idle times.  Words doesn't have these.  Should it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah.
</I>
