I didn't mean for the wiki to be the place for users to go to view the
documentation, only a place for collaborative development. See my
response to point #3 for more info on this.

Also, note that it is possible now to convert Moin to formats such as
DocBook, and once you get to that point, you can basically get to any
format (LaTeX included).

&gt;<i> 2: It tends to collect editorial annotations, and there's no structured
</I>&gt;<i> way to remove them easily.  This will be confusing.
</I>
Nafai brought up this point, and I told him it was actually good that
they were there since it would be an incentive to fix stuff like &quot;XXX:
This isn't clear!&quot; before a release. But yeah, it's just not practical -
so if you really think it's ncessary, I'll write a tool to automatically
rip out editorial notes. It shouldn't be hard at all, and I don't think
it would be hard to get people to write editorial notes according to
some convention.

&gt;<i> 3: Partially because of 1: and 2:, Wikis are good for tightly knit
</I>&gt;<i> communities, but what we need is external, end-user documentation, that
</I>&gt;<i> will be read by people with no knowledge of how the system works
</I>
I of course would not have the wiki be the actual medium for
distribution/viewing by regular people. It will be released per-version
in the TwistedDocs package, and the API docs will only be a section
inside your main skeleton.

I'm also thinking of adding a user/password protection to the wiki so
only developers (or people we designate as documenters) can work on it.

&gt;<i> Wiki might be a great way to get the documentation process started, and
</I>&gt;<i> a good place to publish drafts, but we already have IRC and cryptic
</I>&gt;<i> references to the mailing list -- we need something that's a more
</I>&gt;<i> gradual, high-quality introduction.
</I>
I don't see how wiki doesn't meet this.

And of course, as I probably don't need to mention, I think wiki is
great for this, because it makes documentation easy to work with through
a unified interface...

I'm also planning on putting the data on CVS so people can hack it with
their regular editors. I'll have to work something out where the wiki's
CVS repository will automatically update itself whenever someone commits
through CVS, but it shouldn't be a problem.

So, I'm going to attempt to submit a lot of documentation, to force you
to use the wiki! Then I will be the uber-documentation Twisted guy, and
you will all bow to me!! In the words of Moshe: &quot;Muhahahahahaha!!!&quot;
