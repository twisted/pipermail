Nah.  We already have to manually frob the interface -- peeling off
methods of a remote reference and sticking them to a copy.  It would
probably look cleaner if we were more explicit about it, anyway :)  I
suppose each of those one-line assignments would turn into a two-line
method declaration (and gasp!  a newline to separate them) but it would
also provide for more flexible emulation of the request interface.  I
think that the existing code there may be an example of the
&quot;poltergeists&quot; antipattern.

Well, yes.  We need a documentation standard for return types (the sound
you hear there is another section of the coding standard being exploded
in a concrete bunker, several miles away) and we might as well use that
to enforce interfaces when we find them.  However -- any sort of
polymorphism is a potential security hole in that regard.  I would like
to see some exploit demonstrations of the sorts of holes that one could
create by passing the wrong serialized data, provided that remote calls
were more explicit.  I don't think it's really serious, or could be
resolved by stricter type-checking.  (After all, any behavior besides
&quot;blow up&quot; pretty much assumes that the client is going to be passing an
object that adheres to a correct interface.)

&quot;Cannot stand to be one of many -- I'm not what they are.&quot;
