You're confusing &quot;objects&quot; and &quot;people&quot;.

I don't trust the remote objects because (A) the communication to them
is potentially visible over the wire and (B) they don't actually exist
on physical hardware I control, e.g. their behavior might have been
tampered with.  They are under the complete control of another person,
who might as well be speaking the wire-protocol personally.

Thinking from a security viewpoint, they *have* already been tampered
with, and the question is &quot;how do I reduce the impact of that on my
service?&quot;.

&gt;<i> Perhaps this _can_ be reduced to &quot;Because it's local and hence I or some
</I>&gt;<i> other local object I trust created it&quot;. However, I think once you start
</I>&gt;<i> going down the path of secure transactions between objects, it's better to

</I>&gt;<i> authenticated and secured communications between objects can be implemented,
</I>&gt;<i> and perhaps even made &quot;translucent&quot;.
</I>
What gave you the idea we were talking about secure distributed
transactions?  I'm just talking about making our current implementation
of remote communications more secure (by default).
