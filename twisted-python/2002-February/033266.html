<PRE>Some quick notes. They're really ideas and opinions, even though it
sounds like I'm telling you what to do. :D

&gt;<i> One central question is &quot;Do queries about a participant get answered by

Let the server handle user-status queries, but let the client tell the
server how to respond to them.

&gt;<i> More specific points:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's no way for a Words client to determine the online status of
</I>&gt;<i> another Participant without adding that person to their contact list. 
</I>&gt;<i> Should there be?  Almost definately.  Unless for some reason you *want*
</I>&gt;<i> them to have to go through the hurdle of getting you added to their
</I>&gt;<i> contact list.
</I>
Let the user-who-is-being-queried specify how they want this to be
answered.

&gt;<i> More user information.  Should a Words client be able to look up another
</I>&gt;<i> Participant and maybe find out what their Identity is, and maybe get a
</I>&gt;<i> few bits of meta-data out of that?  Anything from a single IRCNAME-style
</I>&gt;<i> string to a contact-manager VCard.
</I>
Again, let the client specify.

OK, I'm noticing a pattern here. This &quot;capabilities&quot; issue has been
popping up a *lot* recently, so maybe some sort of generalized
&quot;capability system&quot; might crop up out of this (ie, a way to grant or
deny capabilities between perspectives (or identities?)). something to
think about.

&gt;<i> Server descriptions.  The best I've seen is something like
</I>&gt;<i> self.service.serviceName, which in practice always yields
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;twisted.words&quot;.  How can we get something more descriptive, like &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> Official Words Service Of The 2002 Olympics&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;<A HREF="pb://192.168.0.2/twisted.words/">pb://192.168.0.2/twisted.words/</A>&quot;?
</I>
I'm not sure where you're going with this point, but I get an odd
pleasure out of seeing &quot;<A HREF="pb://">pb://</A>&quot;. 

&gt;<i> When we get inter-server connections going, do we want to disclose which
</I>&gt;<i> server a participant initially signed on to?  Do we want to disclose the
</I>&gt;<i> internet address of the participant's client?
</I>
I *definitely* don't want to allow clients to get IPs of other clients
without explicit consent. After living on dalnet for a few years, where
kiddies DDoS you for looking at them the wrong way, I've been locked
into this opinion. And the server thing - I don't see any harm, but why
does it matter? (that is, if you can think of a reason to do it, I don't
think there's any problem with doing it)

&gt;<i> Away messages and idle times.  Words doesn't have these.  Should it?
</I>
Yeah.

&gt;<i> That's all for now,
</I>
So yeah, unless there's some reason to give access to information about
a user/server other than &quot;because it's in /whois&quot;, then I don't really
see the point.

&gt;<i>  - Kevin, 
</I>&gt;<i>    (who is still NOT wasting coding time on IRC servers.)
</I>
We believe you. Keep up the good work on hacking not-IRC, anyhow. :-D
