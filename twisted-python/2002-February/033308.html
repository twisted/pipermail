For as long as I remember, that was *never* the point. Haven't you ever

It's a different matter when you're talking about networked-app
security.

Well, the point was, the code wasn't *meant* to pass privelaged
information to an object across the wire - notice that it was a Copied.
This could also be done for more things than Copied - imagine a method
that takes a list as one of its arguments and appends some secure data
to it. You could spoof a list with a remote object that has an append()
method.

While I think 'callRemote' is slightly less aesthetic than previously,
this is still a serious issue that needs to be dealt with. I guess I can
live with callRemote if it's the best way to explicit-ize remote
methods.
