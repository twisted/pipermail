Is there a way to fix this?  My lack of education, that is.  There's
more code within the Twisted repository left more me to read, but IIRC
there are actually very few PB interfaces defined there.  (We have Words
and Manhole and...?)   More pertinant here would be other applications
(from the &quot;wilds&quot;) which employ Twisted technology.  Are there any such
0775 codebases I should be aware of?  The accusation has been made that
no one actually *uses* Twisted for anything (not to name names, but he's
Canadian and works in Japan), but assuming that's not the case, maybe we
could beef up the &quot;sites using Twisted&quot; list a little.
