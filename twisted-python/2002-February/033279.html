Interesting. Maybe we could have an option to say &quot;let the client
respond to this query&quot;, but maybe that would just be a bunch of added
complexity. *shrug*.

[snip...]

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Server descriptions.  The best I've seen is something like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; self.service.serviceName, which in practice always yields
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;twisted.words&quot;.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure where you're going with this point,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I just want to stop seeing &quot;welcome to twisted.quux&quot; on whatever service
</I>&gt;<i> I sign on to, and instead see something that identifies whose service
</I>&gt;<i> I'm connected using.
</I>
That probably shouldn't be the service name, but some sort of MOTD
feature.

&gt;<i> &gt; I *definitely* don't want to allow clients to get IPs of other clients
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without explicit consent. After living on dalnet for a few years, where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kiddies DDoS you for looking at them the wrong way, I've been locked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into this opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're right about client IPs, I think.  There are only two reasons
</I>&gt;<i> those are useful on IRC.  1) to help identify the user, which you have a
</I>&gt;<i> hard time doing due to IRC's non-existant authentication 2) DoS
</I>&gt;<i> attacks.  Since we'll actually have authentication, reason #1 goes away.
</I>
Not allowing viewable IPs allows DoS attacks? Hmm. I guess when it comes
to ops trying to ban a join-flood, or something. Of course, you can
always have programmed DoS-stoppers, as well as &quot;wordscops&quot; who can see
the IPs of participants. Or am I way off?

&gt;<i> &gt; And the server thing - I don't see any harm, but why
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does it matter?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can think of two reasons for publishing the server address.  One is
</I>&gt;<i> for advertising, you might be thinking &quot;Gee, my server sucks.  What are
</I>&gt;<i> other people using?&quot;  The other might be to help track down problems. 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;That server is administered really poorly.  Lets add it to our
</I>&gt;<i> blacklist.&quot;
</I>
OK.
