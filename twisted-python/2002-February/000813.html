Distributed twisted.web, but you're right, that's about it.

It is indeed unfortunate that much Twisted-using code is closed.  Not my
decision, I assure you ;).

I believe Itamar is using PB, so you could ask to look at his code -- I
know that Sean was planning on releasing a small demo at some point. 
However, this is a circular problem.  Much of this past week for me has
been spent working on a new website for tm.com and trying to come up
with introductory documentation for PB.  It needs to be documented,
standardized, and released as 1.0 before we can really expect droves of
people to come flocking to it.

Does anyone else on this list have some code to reference?  The other
folks I know of using Twisted are mostly using the other components at
this point.

&gt;<i> &gt; Who would want to replace me with another evil robot?

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Do not trust the Shover-robot, he is malfunctioning,&quot;
</I>
&quot;Do not trust the Pusher-robot, he is doing a little too much of his own
stuff.&quot;

-- 
&quot;Cannot stand to be one of many -- I'm not what they are.&quot;
