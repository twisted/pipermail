coming completely out of the blue with no experience or understanding to
give me enough qualifications to even comment (but doing it anyway :-).

Just a thought; why is a local object any more trustworthy than a remote
one? To me the local vs remote trust boundary seem to be a bit arbitary. It
is better to think about the trust relationship between the objects than
where they are located. Why and how do the objects trust each other?

Perhaps this _can_ be reduced to &quot;Because it's local and hence I or some
other local object I trust created it&quot;. However, I think once you start
going down the path of secure transactions between objects, it's better to
try and provide a generalised solution. There are various ways that
authenticated and secured communications between objects can be implemented,
and perhaps even made &quot;translucent&quot;.
