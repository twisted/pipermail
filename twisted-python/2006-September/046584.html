<PRE>Hi Glyph. I have recently added a post to the wxpython list to see if
other folks can make themselves available to assist with this effort.

<A HREF="http://lists.wxwidgets.org/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?11:mss:55602:200609:hafkbkhbehmbhikjmmaf">http://lists.wxwidgets.org/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?11:mss:55602:200609:hafkbkhbehmbhikjmmaf</A>

Perhaps the first thing will be the deprecation warnings since these 
should be relatively simple. Then try and see what is happening with the 
failures. If the failures are as the result of reactor iterations for 
tests not relevant to the reactor, what direction should be taken? I 
raise this since this seems to run through Bob's comments and others 
concerning the qt reactor.

Please let us know about the buildbot once it is set up. I see Stephen
has offered support for a buildbot for windows which is excellent. Thank
you Stephen! Stephen - my sentiments about windows too but I am also in
the same boat as far as potential consumers of my app. I am also trying 
to keep my code crossplatform for mac (second most important) and linux.

Regards,
David

</I>&gt;<i> This is as much as anyone could reasonably ask.  I'm sure that if you 
</I>&gt;<i> start trying to track down the issues within Twisted and asking 
</I>&gt;<i> questions, you will find that people on this mailing list and #twisted 
</I>&gt;<i> on chat.freenode.net would be more than happy to help you learn more 
</I>&gt;<i> about the reactor's internals.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wxpython and twisted are both important toolkits. Twisted integration 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is important to me for my own projects. I am hoping someone from the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Chandler project thinks so too and feels that sharing in this effort 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is the right thing to do. I know there are a number of folks using 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wxreactor or threadedselectreactor in their wxpython code. It is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasonable that we shoulder some responsibility to help ourselves.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I really appreciate this sentiment.  I'm glad you're interested in 
</I>&gt;<i> helping out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I think that Chandler uses Twisted in a rather idiosyncratic 
</I>&gt;<i> way; it doesn't necessarily make sense for them to help, since this 
</I>&gt;<i> isn't code that they're using.  If you can interest them in doing so, of 
</I>&gt;<i> course, that's great :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you are aware of other uses of wxreactor though, the more the merrier.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now that you've volunteered to at least start looking at the problems 
</I>&gt;<i> here, I'll see if I can set up a buildslave to test these reactors.  
</I>&gt;<i> However, I will probably only be able to set it up on one platform, and 
</I>&gt;<i> given wx's nature we'll need a few other buildbots to make sure it works 
</I>&gt;<i> consistently on mac/win/linux, so if any wxreactor users want to 
</I>&gt;<i> contribute an additional buildbot that would be great.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please keep us all appraised of your progress and let us know if you 
</I>&gt;<i> need help!
