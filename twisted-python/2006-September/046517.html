<PRE>It's been pointed out to me lately that, while the general procedures in
place for Twisted development are somewhat understood, specifics may be
lacking.  So, specifically, the development process Twisted has adopted
is this:

  Commits to trunk/ must be the result of the review process outlined
below.  The only exception to this is the Twisted.Quotes file.  There
are no other exceptions.

  Changes to Twisted must be accompanied by a ticket in the tracker.

  Changes must be reviewed by a developer other than the author of the
changes.  If changes are paired on, a third party must review them.  If
changes constitute the work of several people who worked independently,
a non-author must review them.

  A reviewer can be anyone who is familiar with the Twisted codebase,
coding standard, and review requirements.  A reviewer need not
necessarily be familiar with the specific area of Twisted being changed,
but he or she should feel confident in his or her abilities to spot
problems in the change.

  A reviewer must reject a set of changes in any of the following
circumstances:

    The test suite fails on any of the supported* platforms as a result
of the changes.

    The changes alter the behavior of code in a way which is not tested.

    The changes add new behavior without adding test coverage for that
behavior.

    The changes modify public APIs which are undocumented (ie, a
function which has no docstring is modified, or a class which has no
docstring has methods added to it).

    The changes modify the behavior of a documented API without updating
the documentation.

    The changes violate the coding standard.

  A reviewer may reject a set of changes for other reasons, most of
which are hard to quantify.  Basically, use your best judgement, and
don't be afraid to point out problems which don't fit into the above
list.

  After a reviewer has given a change set the okay, the author (or
another developer, if the author is so inclined or lacks commit
privileges) may commit the change set to trunk.

  The trunk commit must include the name of the author or authors,
reviewer or reviews, and the tickets which are being resolved by the
changes being committed.  The suggested format for this is:

    Author: &lt;names&gt;
    Reviewer: &lt;names&gt;
    Fixes #&lt;ticket number&gt;

  Only the &quot;Fixes&quot; line actually *needs* to conform to this (since it is
automatically processed in order to update the ticket's state in the
tracker).  The commit message should also describe the change being made
in a modest amount of detail.  This should be detailed enough for
someone doing a release to formulate a changelog entry.

  If a change set somehow introduces a test suite regression or is
otherwise found to be undesirable, it is to be reverted.  Any developer
may revert a commit which introduces a test suite regression on a
supported platform.

  If a branch is used, it should be deleted a short time after after it
is merged into trunk (leaving enough time for the buildslaves to run to
completion is a good idea, in case a regression has been introduced and
the merge must be reverted).

Chris has put this onto the wiki:

Developers, please ask questions if any part of this remains unclear.

Apologies for not posting this sooner,

Jean-Paul
