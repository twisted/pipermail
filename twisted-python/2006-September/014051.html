It would be annoying to me if I could not use Twisted and PyObjC
together.  Currently I have a couple of noddy applications (the GUI
equivalent of 5 line shell scripts) doing this (using tsr) and they
work fine.

I understand why you want to have less untrustworthy code in Twisted,
but I think throwing out both tsr and cfreactor in 2.6 would be a step
back, not forwards.

I could claim that I'll try to look at cfreactor, but it's not
especially realistic...

Cheers,
