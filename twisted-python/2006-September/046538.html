All of this sounds doable, either with PB or with XML-RPC.  Certain parts
will be easier with PB, like permissions (since PB gives you remote objects
which can represent the capabilities available to a particular user - with
XML-RPC you don't have remote objects, but you can cobble together something
equivalent, it'll just be either slightly messier or slightly harder).  Other
parts will be easier with XML-RPC, like accessing the system from a C or C++
application, since there are numerous XML-RPC implementations for those
languages, and as far as I know no complete PB implementation for either.  A
third choice to consider may be AMP, which would be easy to implement in C or
C++ (and someone else may have done it by the time you actually get around to
that part of your project), although it also does not provide a remote object
system natively.
