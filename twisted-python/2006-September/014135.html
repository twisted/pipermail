Yep, it's unfortunate that we were forced to use such an ugly API.  However, the *correct* way to do this is to use IOCP, and good IOCP support has been *years* in the making.  We still haven't got a reliably working IOCP buildbot.

You're welcome to contribute a patch which cleans this up on the select reactor, but frankly I don't se any approach which would be better.

&gt;<i>I really can't believe that win32 support for asynchronous I/O works

</I>
Yeah, Windows is pretty terrible.  It's only a problem in some versions, but I forget where and when it was fixed.

&gt;<i>By the way, instead of using a polling, why not to use a separate thread
</I>&gt;<i>that puts data into a DeferredQueue?
</I>
Because interrupting a blocked thread is a dangerous and error-prone task.  It was hard enough getting the thing to just work with non-blocking pipe IO.

&gt;<i>&quot;&quot;&quot;Anonymous pipes are implemented using a named pipe with a unique
</I>&gt;<i>name. Therefore, you can often pass a handle to an anonymous pipe to a
</I>&gt;<i>function that requires a handle to a named pipe.
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>
The word &quot;often&quot; is the killer there.

&gt;<i>&quot;&quot;&quot;A child process can inherit [...]
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>
&gt;<i>So, why not to create a named pipe with an unique name, know to both the
</I>&gt;<i> parent and the child process, as an example using an enviroment variable?
</I>
Because that would not be usable as standard output using the usual APIs.  This is not just for running other Twisted-using programs in a subprocess, but any program which attempts to adhere to UNIX conventions around standard IO.

&gt;<i>I think that using named pipes can simplify the _dumbwin32proc.
</I>&gt;<i>Moreover polling a named pipe is not an efficient operation
</I>&gt;<i>(reading the author of &quot;Windows System Programming&quot;).
</I>
The goal of _dumbwin32proc is obviously not efficiency, it is correctness in a configuration which is not well-supported on Windows.  Why do you think its name begins with &quot;dumb&quot;?

&gt;<i>Lastly, the parent process, after creating a named pipe instance, can
</I>&gt;<i>wait for a client connection using ConnectNamedPipe.
</I>
... as long as it can wait for the completion event.  Which it can't, because it's using select().
