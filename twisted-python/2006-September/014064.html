&quot;If it's not tested, it's broken.&quot;

The point is not that I want to drop this code from Twisted.  In fact, far from it, I would like Twisted to support as many toolkits as possible.

The point is that these reactors are currently excluded from automated test coverage, and have no maintainers.  That means that they do not currently work as well as the other reactors, but more seriously, if they were to be *completely* broken (say, start raising exceptions upon import), nobody on the Twisted team would know until users started complaining, and most likely users would not complain until well after we had already produced a broken release.

We could add automated test coverage relatively easily, *IF* someone would volunteer to at least look at the results of that coverage and contribute some fixes.  Perhaps you were not even aware that there are reliability problems with threadedselectreactor.  To see an example of the problem, run &quot;trial --reactor threadedselect twisted&quot;.

Would you volunteer to have a look at some of these problems and try to fix them?  I have no idea how many people are using Twisted in conjunction with wxwindows today, but you would be a hero to all of them, I'm sure :).
