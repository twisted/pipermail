Thanks very much for that pointer.  I knew this was possible but it is the first working example I've seen of it!

It does &quot;import&quot; qt in the sense that there is an import line at the top of the file which will load the library.  IANAL, but as far as I know it is a matter of debate whether this sort of reference constitutes a &quot;derivative work&quot; under copyright law.  As such, it would be best to get Riverbank and Trolltech on the record as to their respective opinions on whether licensing such code as MIT is a GPL violation, since I believe PyQt is clearly a derivative work of Qt itself, and therefore both companies are potential enforcers of the license in this case.  Is anyone aware of the correct point of contact for these inquiries?

If they do indeed consider it a violation, we'd have to remove it from Twisted.  However, in that case, I would be happy to contribute the qt reactor to Riverbank and have them distribute it (under the GPL) with PyQt rather than us distributing it together with Twisted.  This might be a good excuse to finally make reactors properly pluggable.

As for this thread, I'd appreciate it if only people with relevant legal expertise and/or information from a responsible party at Trolltech or Riverbank would reply.  I know license debates are always fun to get involved in, but this is not the appropriate forum.  Twisted's MIT license is a matter of policy and is not open to debate.
