<PRE>Well, for me the threadedselectreactor works quite nicely with wx.
It has it's flaws and I've spent some time working around them. On the other 
hand if that reactor is dropped, I'd rather drop Twisted from my application 
than rewrite the GUI part with a toolkit that kind of sucks and looks like 
crap on most platforms (i.e. GTK or TK).
I like Twisted PB and I like wx - that's pretty much all I have to say about 
this.  Let's say it this way: the network part of an application is what 
makes it work, the GUI part is what makes the money - guess what's dropped 
first :-(

</I>&gt;<i> included) only care about this toolkit, so it's the one that is likely to

</I>&gt;<i> GTK to the Cocoa APIs for OS X at some point in the near future.  Then I
</I>&gt;<i> can cease caring even about corefoundation ;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Win32 event loop is also supported, although its buildbot still isn't
</I>&gt;<i> green yet.  That is a &quot;toolkit&quot; of sorts.  I think that it might even work
</I>&gt;<i> with MFC but I'm a bit murky on the details.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, yes, the situation is even worse than you suggest; unless someone else
</I>&gt;<i> volunteers to help, we will have 2 supported toolkits: GTK, and GDI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted's architecture was developed with GUI toolkits in mind, and I would
</I>&gt;<i> like it to support as many as possible.  I hope that one day, all toolkit
</I>&gt;<i> developers will actually care whether Twisted supports their code or not. 
</I>&gt;<i> Until now, though, it seems that we have been unable to attract the
</I>&gt;<i> attention of even one member of each community with the appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> experience and motivation to help out.
