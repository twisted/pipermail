The alternative is to eventually ship a version of Twisted where that reactor doesn't work at all.  (Heck, maybe it doesn't work now, I don't know.  I haven't heard from anyone using it yet.)  As I said to Uwe, I am saying that these reactors should not be distributed with Twisted because we don't know whether they work; I am not saying that we should aggressively attempt to destroy all copies of this code present anywhere.

&gt;<i>I could claim that I'll try to look at cfreactor, but it's not

</I>
If you think that tsreactor is the right way to go for mac apps, by all means, have a look at that instead.  It doesn't sound like you'd care if cfreactor went away.

Ideally, you could write a &quot;macreactor&quot; which would set up the appropriate interleave and shutdown with tsreactor so that we could run a buildbot in the context of a mac gui, similar to what itamar's wxreactor does, and start fixing tests from there.
