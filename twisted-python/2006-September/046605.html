Twisted is ostensibly a derivative work of all of the parts of Twisted.

And that's your professional legal opinion?

It may be that riverbank and trolltech agree with this interpretation.  The response I received wasn't entirely clear.  However, you are making a number of assumptions about intellectual propertly law which are both outside your expertise and, to my knowledge, still undecided by any case law.

I've asked the fellow at Riverbank for a clarification of his intent before reviewing and committing the removal.  However, the impression I got from my first exchange is that Trolltech regards the QT API as their intellectual property, so the presence of phrases like &quot;QObject.connect&quot; and &quot;QSocketNotifier.__init__&quot; would make qtreactor a derivative work of their intellectual property, much like simple mentions of a fictional character's name in a short story can also classify as a derivative work.

</I>
If we distribute it separately, I believe it will create license confusion due to the interaction of Qt and PyQt commercial licenses.  However, I'll let the people who are actually interested in Twisted and Qt integration work this out with the PyQt maintainer; I don't care, personally.
