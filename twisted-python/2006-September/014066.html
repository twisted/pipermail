That it's broken according to the test suite, and that nobody has  
volunteered to fix it.

Perhaps the bugs are in the tests (a cursory glance at the qt  
failures suggests this might be the case for that reactor), or  
perhaps the tested functionality is something that should be expected  
to not work for that reactor, but in any case, either the tests or  
the reactor should be fixed. Tests that have been failing for a long  
time indicates that nobody cares enough about that code to fix them.

Clearly the best resolution of this would be to have all the  
mentioned reactors fixed. Then, nobody would propose that they be  
removed.
