</I>
Hate to break it to you, but I tried a preview build of soon-to-be- 
released (I think) wxPython 2.7, and the twisted code raised  
exceptions on import :) I reinstalled 2.6.3.3 so can't show you the  
traceback. Dailies are available here if anyone wants to see what I  
mean.

Anyway, I am currently using wxPython and Twisted in a project and I  
would sorely miss either of them!!! I just wanted to cast my vote as  
another developer using this (killer) combination! wx and Twisted  
(especially PB) are making short work of writing a multi-user client/ 
server app. From what I've been able to find, wx is the only GUI  
toolkit that is cross platform and rich. Qt isn't an option for me  
because of it's expensive commercial licensing, and Tk just looks  
plain horrible. There must be many other users wx/Twisted, surely.

I haven't experienced any problems using wxPython and Twisted  
together, except perhaps for this.  Normally, a wx app will shutdown  
when the last window in your applciation closes. Since the reactor  
stops this from happening I workaround this by maintaining a list of  
open windows and on close of a window I remove it from the list and  
then check if it's empty. If it is, I shutdown the reactor.
