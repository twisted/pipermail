   To be clear, the need for tsr or cfr is not limited to GUI  
applications; it's needed by anything using CoreFoundation and  
therefore requiring CFRunLoop.  Many non-GUI applications require a  
CFRunLoop.  Server applications that want to use any of the above-BSD  
OS X toolkits (eg. via PyObjC) will fall into this camp.

   I expect to be in this category eventually, though I have been  
avoiding it to date because PyObjC isn't presently included in OS X.

   Well, you just got this spiffy XServe.  Is it not capable of  
running a tsr buildbot?  Would it be hard to maintain?  (I seriously  
have no clue.)
