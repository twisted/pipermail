Fair enough.  I meant to say that the way Twisted apps are designed is to treat all events as events.  This would require writing extra glue code for certain tyes of events.

&gt;<i>Okay.  I'm willing to do without that.
</I>
In that case, more power to you :)

&gt;<i>I think *that* is the real problem ... not technical, just interest

I've done a lot of waiting too.  Now I'm starting with the yelling and hollering, see if that strategy works better :).

&gt;<i>I completely agree that it should not be part of Twisted
</I>&gt;<i>at all ... but if I succeed with it, I'll certainly document what I

</I>
Sounds great to me.

&gt;&gt;<i>One major reason I'd like a WX reactor to continue to exist in some form is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>OSAF's usage of Twisted and WX.  They have a similarly baroque model for 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>handing data back and forth between Twisted code and GUI code, ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>... and everything else (sorry, couldn't resist ;) ...
</I>
Heh.  Let's just keep it straight on the record - *I* didn't say it! :-)

&gt;<i>... hmmm ... I've been on all the OSAF Chandler/Scooby/Cosmo lists
</I>&gt;<i>since April (and that's a lot of freakin' mail ;), and not *once* in
</I>&gt;<i>that interval has &quot;twisted&quot; occurred in the subject line of a
</I>&gt;<i>message, and no substantive discussion of it in the bodies either.
</I>
Yeah, I don't think that this is really a high priority issue for them.  Their application works fine in its current state, and they have a LOT of programmers working on it.  A change to the architecture at this point would be so expensive that any other benefits which might come along with it wouldn't be worth it.

&gt;<i>I know about their zanshin twisted-based framework for WebDAV/CalDAV,
</I>&gt;<i>and that it's used in their Sharing architecture, which is used by
</I>&gt;<i>the Chandler wx GUI, but I just updated my chandler svn checkout, and
</I>&gt;<i>I counted 17 occurrences of the zanshin &quot;blockUntil&quot; function in the
</I>&gt;<i>Sharing.py module ... if it's so clean, how come they need those?
</I>
I was just trying to be nice :-P.

&gt;<i>(In zanshin's docs, &quot;blockUntil&quot; is billed as &quot;for test purposes&quot; ... ;)
</I>
Oh yeah, I remember that &quot;test&quot; function... heh heh.  I wish them much luck in the 5-year 1000-man project it takes to remove it.

&gt;<i>Well, yeah, but I don't think OSAF has the resources to put into it
</I>&gt;<i>either, and Robin *works* for OSAF.
</I>
I just don't think it's a relevant issue for them.  They're not even using the code I'm talking about removing.

&gt;<i>As if there's going to be some other &quot;tested, robust integration
</I>&gt;<i>support&quot; ... nothing on the horizon that I can see (and as I say,
</I>&gt;<i>I've been watching for a long time).
</I>
Understandable...

&gt;<i>Process spawning!  Rusty code!  Spawning threads, *and* blocking!
</I>&gt;<i>My, you do paint a rosy picture.  All your handwaving and FUD makes
</I>&gt;<i>me want to try it, because it's probably quicker and easier than
</I>&gt;<i>discussing it.  But thanks for the warnings, anyway!  ;)
</I>
What can I say?  Everything is completely terrible.  Still, good luck trying to make that work; let us know how it goes.
