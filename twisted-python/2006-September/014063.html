<PRE>Hi all. I am also using the threadedselectreactor in wx without 
problems. I have only just read these posts and cannot understand any 
reasoning to drop it. What am I missing?

Regards,
David

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GTK is supported, has a buildbot, and is currently green.  Frankly, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people who currently do at least 90% of the maintenance on Twisted (myself
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> included) only care about this toolkit, so it's the one that is likely to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GTK to the Cocoa APIs for OS X at some point in the near future.  Then I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can cease caring even about corefoundation ;).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The Win32 event loop is also supported, although its buildbot still isn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> green yet.  That is a &quot;toolkit&quot; of sorts.  I think that it might even work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with MFC but I'm a bit murky on the details.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, yes, the situation is even worse than you suggest; unless someone else
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> volunteers to help, we will have 2 supported toolkits: GTK, and GDI.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Twisted's architecture was developed with GUI toolkits in mind, and I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like it to support as many as possible.  I hope that one day, all toolkit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers will actually care whether Twisted supports their code or not. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Until now, though, it seems that we have been unable to attract the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attention of even one member of each community with the appropriate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experience and motivation to help out.
