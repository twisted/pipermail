Sorry, I wrote this while rather tired.  Let me clarify.

	I know that twisted.web 1.0 is stable and production proven.
	And I know people are happy with it and love it.

	Right now I have a bunch of existing scripts that crunch analytics  
and are already built on mechanize and run as cronjobs.
	I'm transitioning some to a job queue system , trying to optimize  
some resources by handling it all within twisted.
	My winwin situation on choosing mechanize is in part , because
		a) it involves copy-pasting a few lines and reusing classes I  
already have -- hopefully wrapping it into the event loop -- vs  
porting a bunch of stuff to twisted.web.client1
		and
		b) its actively maintained, which means i get some random new  
features on their development list that I need already ( like  
integrated beautful soup support ).  most that  stuff is  trivial and  
easily implemented in twisted, but i don't have to do that work.  its  
done (in mechanize ).

So I'd like to stay within mechanize.   and I think i've got a way to  
wrap it into twisted.

Thanks for the suggestions and trying to put me on the right track.
