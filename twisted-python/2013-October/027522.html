<PRE>&gt;<i> I would like to announce the first release of txThings. It is a simple library
</I>&gt;<i> for Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). CoAP is a relatively new protocol
</I>&gt;<i> designed for &quot;Internet of Things&quot; and M2M communications.
</I>
Cool! 

&gt;<i> Internet of Things is currently very interesting field of development. It is
</I>&gt;<i> approaching
</I>&gt;<i> a phase where many opportunities for both large and small players. I think
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted is
</I>&gt;<i> well suited for development of IoT apps:
</I>&gt;<i> - it's stable
</I>&gt;<i> - it's Python based and portable
</I>&gt;<i> - it has good support for UDP and TCP, which makes it ideal for proxying IoT
</I>&gt;<i> protocols to HTTP
</I>&gt;<i> In my opinion in the next three years, at least 20% of Twisted apps will be
</I>&gt;<i> IoT related
</I>&gt;<i> (educated guess, no hard data :) )
</I>
I fully agree that Python/Twisted may have a particular competitive
advantage in embedded / IoT (see below).

And if so, why not take that opportunity and actively embrace / promote
specifically IoT from the Twisted community?

Why I think Python/Twisted has an edge:

- the (more pure) Web play languages like PHP and Ruby don't fit well with
processing serial port data or doing UDP (if possible at all)
- Perl - shudder;) Python is easy to approach for beginners and sane and bla
bla bla
- C: is here to stay, and has it's place in IoT
- C++: can't see a particular competitive advantage for IoT
- same goes for (great) stuff like Haskell or Erlang

Whats your take on the stuff below?

There is .NET driven by MS. I wasn't aware that they created a .NET Micro
under _Apache 2.0_ (!):

Then there is Oracle with Java ME

Then there is .. JavaScript. Put v8/node on your Pi. However, Node has
quite a different focus. Last time I checked e.g. the support for serial
was not in main project (I had read comments they don't _want_ to have it).

And then there is the Lua universe that has a bunch of brilliant stuff:

If above sounds OT for this list, in one way probably, but when looking from
the angle: competitive advantage of Python/Twisted and opportunities for
expanding the community and actively promoting Twisted, I'd say it's on
topic.
