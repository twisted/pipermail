<PRE>Hi!

I filed a ticket (Log the log events in twisted.internet.protocol.Factory
using the new logging system &lt;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7897">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7897</A>&gt;)
and I have also submitted a patch for it. However, while working on the
patch, I had some concerns that I have already summarized in a ticket
comment. I would really appreciate it if someone could please take a look
and give me some advice as to how to move further with this ticket so that
I can start working on other patches for porting to twisted.logger. :-)

About a week ago, I sent a similar email to the mailing list (quoted
below), but did not get a reply, so I thought I would send another one.

&gt;<i> Hello everyone!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am aware that I have sent an email with a similar subject line before,
</I>&gt;<i> but this time this involves a particular ticket (&lt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7897">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7897</A>&gt;) that I have submitted for
</I>&gt;<i> review. The ticket is about logging the log events in
</I>&gt;<i> twisted.internet.protocol.Factory using the new logging system, and it is
</I>&gt;<i> one of the first tickets about modifying existing logging statements in the
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted code base to use the new system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While working on this ticket, I ran into some issues that I have
</I>&gt;<i> summarized in a comment on the same ticket &lt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7897#comment:2">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7897#comment:2</A>&gt; and it would mean a
</I>&gt;<i> lot to me if someone could take a look.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I recall that HawkOwl had some concerns regarding moving to the new
</I>&gt;<i> logging system. And so I thought that it would be better if I share my
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts on the mailing list as well and not just on the particular ticket,
</I>&gt;<i> so that anybody who is interested in sharing their concerns can do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Eeshan Garg
</I>&gt;<i>

Let me know what you think!

Thanks &amp; regards,
Eeshan Garg
