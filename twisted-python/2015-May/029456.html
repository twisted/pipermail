<PRE>Hello there,

if you wish to make a pull request, file a bug report or ask Ldaptor
specific questions, you can contact the developer directly here:
<A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/ldaptor/issues">https://github.com/twisted/ldaptor/issues</A>

Not everyone who works on Ldaptor is a member of this mailing list.

I'll try to answer inline:

</I>&gt;<i> ldifftree.py and after some debugging i got a search() method that is able
</I>&gt;<i> to do an indexed search of OTPme's directory (which is not in svn yet)
</I>&gt;<i> which allows fast search results for a directory with more than 2048 users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Congratulations! :) How are you going about this? Are these additions
backwards compatible with OpenLDAP? Are you also writing test-cases to
cover these?


&gt;<i> but as this is just a start there will be more problems to solve i guess.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There always are, when I first started using Ldaptor, startTLS was broken
which was a requirement for me to do any work with it.


&gt;<i> one issue i have is that an ldapsearch against ldaptor which requests just
</I>&gt;<i> some attributes instead of all always returns all object attributes.
</I>&gt;<i> for example the ldapsearch below returns the complete ldif of each found
</I>&gt;<i> user in ldaptor (tested also with ldiftree.py):
</I>&gt;<i> ldapsearch -H <A HREF="ldap://localhost:8080">ldap://localhost:8080</A> -b &quot;ou=users,dc=domain,dc=intern&quot; -w
</I>&gt;<i> abcd -x '(uid=*)' givenName
</I>&gt;<i> Running the same search against my openldap server it returns just the dn
</I>&gt;<i> and givenName attributes of each found user.
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a missing feature or do i just miss something in my db class?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Please file an issue on github with an example (ldif entries in a txt file
would work) that can be used to test with a real OpenLDAP server. Then the
ldapsearch like you provided above and a snippit of your ldaptor code so we
can try to reproduce it.


&gt;<i> another important part i haven't looked at yet is how to implement
</I>&gt;<i> authentication. as OTPme focus on OTPs i dont want to add any user
</I>&gt;<i> passwords to the ldap tree. the smoothest solution would be to get
</I>&gt;<i> username+OTP from ldaptor to do authentication. maybe you can give me some
</I>&gt;<i> hints in the right direction? :)
</I>

Another issue/question for github, there are others that have spent more
time in this area of the codebase.


&gt;<i> and the last question for now is related the licensing. OTPme is licensed
</I>&gt;<i> under GPLv2. do i run into any licensing issues when using ldaptor with
</I>&gt;<i> OTPme?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ldaptor is MIT/Expat license, if you would like to commit code then that
too must be MIT/Expat otherwise it won't be accepted. As for using Ldaptor
to talk with OTPme, there shouldn't be a license problem as they are two
separate applications/services. What exactly is your concern there?
