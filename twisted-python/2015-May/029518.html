<PRE>Hi glyph and exarkun,

[1] The compose syntax is the least interesting part for me here, and seems
to cause the most bike-shedding, so I think I will punt on that. Instead, I
will write a function called &quot;compose()&quot; which can be used from .tac files
or possibly other plug-ins, leaving the issue of the syntax for a different
day.
[2] It seems like the biggest inconsistency in the docstrings is that they
mention the parent without having an attribute for it. (E.g., the docstring
for setServiceParent *says* &quot;parent attribute is set&quot;, but there's no
&quot;parent attribute&quot; in the interface. Glyph, if you want to open a ticket
with the issues you found, please assign it to me -- otherwise, more
specificity is useful!
[2a] Since the docstrings do refer to the parent attribute, and since I
would be surprised if services just implemented the interface without
inheriting from &quot;Service&quot;, I wonder if people object *too* much if I &quot;fix&quot;
it by documenting the parent attribute as part of the interface?
[3] I think that with the compose() function available in .tac files, maybe
needing .tac *with* subcommands is not quite as important? Maybe I'll leave
that off of the initial sprint.

So bottom line, current plans:
[4] Implement compose() as a function that takes an iterable-of-iterables,
treats them as command-line arguments for services, and builds a
MultiService() with them all.
[5] Document the parent attribute in IService (and possibly other issues,
depending on Glyph opening a bug for [2]
[6] Implement provides() the way I wanted to (now that parent is documented)

Since it seems like compose-as-a-function is the least controversial bit
here, I'll start with that while the other issues settle down.

Moshe Z.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You could also find some other way to split the argument list but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;+&quot; doesn't seem particularly obscure in this context to me.  (If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there's really a need to pass a literal &quot;+&quot; to a plugin we could add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;an escaping syntax as well.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;I think if we are adding syntax, then we should also add escaping at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;same time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;On a related note, when designing this kind of syntax, I think it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;often valuable to explictly leave some of the space as an explict
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;error,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;to leave freedom to extend the syntax in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I think this is 100% correct.  This is part of why I don't want the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;syntax added to `Options`.  If it's a feature of, say, a &quot;compose&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;twistd plugin then you can always throw the whole &quot;compose&quot; twistd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;plugin in the trash and start again.  That gives you quite a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;space for syntax changes. :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;(And of course, not introducing a syntax at all leaves you even more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;room... but talking this crowd out of inventing weird syntaxes is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;probably an exercise in futility.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Much as I love weird syntaxes, using &quot;+&quot; as a separator for a 'compose'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;plugin seems about as straightforward as I could imagine such a thing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;working.  Do you have an alternate proposal that is less 'weird'?  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;wouldn't promise to accept it but I wouldn't want to go with something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;unnecessarily weird just due to a failure of my imagination.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's possible this is a case of necessary weirdness - at least, if
</I>&gt;<i> you're dead-set on some kind of option-based CLI interface to this
</I>&gt;<i> functionality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Think about other CLI tools that try to offer this kind of composition.
</I>&gt;<i> Only two really come to mind for me and one of those is not exactly well
</I>&gt;<i> regarded for its novel syntax (hint - it rhymes with &quot;schmestreamer).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not to say that this kind of composition is a bad thing - or
</I>&gt;<i> even that no other widely-used software supports the kind of invoke-
</I>&gt;<i> several-things-of-stuff behavior that we're talking about providing
</I>&gt;<i> access to here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I do think it is the case that most of the world tries to solve
</I>&gt;<i> this problem without trying to force everything into a world-view framed
</I>&gt;<i> by GNU getopt().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With that in mind, here are some alternatives:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   (0) The null proposal
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     $ twistd compose \
</I>&gt;<i>         web --port 80 +
</I>&gt;<i>         manhole --auth foo + \
</I>&gt;<i>         logging --path /var/run
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   (1) Borrow `--` which already means &quot;stop parsing options here&quot;.  It
</I>&gt;<i> makes sense if you think about sub-commands as existing on a stack and
</I>&gt;<i> `--` meaning &quot;pop the stack&quot;.  Possibly not actually feasible since I
</I>&gt;<i> think `Options` already knows what `--` means (by virtue of actually
</I>&gt;<i> *using* getopt()) and uses it to separate options from positional
</I>&gt;<i> arguments (and therefore it's not an unambiguous separator - but I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't double-checked this).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     $ twistd compose \
</I>&gt;<i>         web --port 80 -- \
</I>&gt;<i>         manhole --auth foo -- \
</I>&gt;<i>         logging --path /var/run
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   (2) Put things into strings which already have well-defined escape
</I>&gt;<i> syntax:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     $ twistd compose \
</I>&gt;<i>         'web --port 80' \
</I>&gt;<i>         'manhole --auth foo' \
</I>&gt;<i>         'logging --path /var/run'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   (3) Load things from a file (really just a variation on (2)):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     $ cat myapp.compose
</I>&gt;<i>     web --port 80
</I>&gt;<i>     manhole --auth foo
</I>&gt;<i>     logging --path /var/run
</I>&gt;<i>     $ twistd compose myapp.compose
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note these aren't really syntax ideas.  Apart from (1), they're ideas
</I>&gt;<i> for not needing a new syntax.  As soon as you actually invent a new
</I>&gt;<i> syntax you invite comments like &quot;Well, maybe you should use `;` instead
</I>&gt;<i> of `+` because `;` is already kind of ingrained as a separator and
</I>&gt;<i> people are used to having to escape it&quot; (which, see, I put in quotes,
</I>&gt;<i> because I'm totally not saying that, even if it is totally true) to
</I>&gt;<i> which you can only really reply that your gut agrees or your gut
</I>&gt;<i> disagrees and it's always a bummer when the best support you have for
</I>&gt;<i> some programming decision is some gut feeling you had.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I might actually be somewhat attracted to (3) because:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * I don't really want to build up giant piles of configuration on my
</I>&gt;<i> command line and then rely on my shell history for being able to find it
</I>&gt;<i> again.  myapp.compose is something I could even put in my version
</I>&gt;<i> control system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * Despite shell quoting and escaping rules being perfectly well
</I>&gt;<i> defined, I'd really much rather not have to deal with an automatic extra
</I>&gt;<i> layer of quotes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And a last point to consider about new syntaxes - what are the security
</I>&gt;<i> considerations of a command like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     $ twistd compose \
</I>&gt;<i>         web --port ${WEB_PORT} +
</I>&gt;<i>         manhole --auth foo + \
</I>&gt;<i>         logging --path /var/run
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll grant there's a bug there (the shell variable should be quoted -
</I>&gt;<i> but I only know one person who consistently gets that right).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regardless, I think any proposal would greatly benefit from a much
</I>&gt;<i> greater consideration of use-cases and examples than I've yet seen
</I>&gt;<i> discussed in this thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
