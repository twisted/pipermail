The correct next step here would be for you to take Aron's patch and address the review feedback mentioned on 6371.  It sounds like you want to wait around for the patch to be completed by someone else - if everyone does that, then no patches ever get finished :).

You may be concerned that it's somehow rude to pick up someone else's work and complete it.  It isn't - quite the opposite.  If a patch has gone more than a week without being acted upon, it is almost certainly not going to get any attention unless someone else picks it up.

If you are looking for assurance that it &quot;works&quot; - no, it doesn't.  If it were of sufficient quality to be included within Twisted and be said to &quot;work&quot; to that standard, it would already have been included.

Thanks for your interest, and I hope you'll step up to complete this work!
