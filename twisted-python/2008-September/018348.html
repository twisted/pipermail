Hmm, it is kind of hard to say what the problem could be, without
seeing the code that is using adbapi and cx_Oracle.

When you say you are receiving ConnectionLost exceptions from cx_Oracle,
are they *really* from cx_Oracle, i.e., &quot;ORA-03135 - Connection lost...&quot;,
or are they just the result of adbapi calling its connectionLost method?

&gt;<i> Has anyone seen this kind of behavior before? What we're probably going

</I>&gt;<i>

I've used cx_Oracle with twisted many times, with many different workloads,
including stored procedures with OUT parameters, and it has always worked
as expected.  If you are able to provide some code, this list might be
able to provide you with more prescriptive advice.

Hope this helps,
