I did look at wokkel. I must be honest, first time round I found it a 
bit difficult to decipher, though that might be because it took a while 
to realise that lots of the pieces were in fact server-side ;o)

Once I'd gone to the effort of re-inventing the wheel however, a 2nd 
look back at wokkel made a lot more sense, and I'll certainly use it 
instead of the code I wrote.

The actual project was for ESB-like use, though that's now been put on 
hold (frankly I think XMPP pubsub might be a little new for that, and 
will probably look at ActiveMQ. It didn't help that ejabberd's 
collections are &quot;funny&quot;).

What I *did* end up doing was start on a basic Nevow/Athena XMPP client 
with basic roster/message functions and also pubsub support. That might 
make a nice example app.

The notion of an all-twisted XMPP server is intriguing, especially if 
some integration with <A HREF="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/txLoadBalancer">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/txLoadBalancer</A> were to 
appear!

</I>
Thinking about it, you're probably right - the list has been quiet 
because not much has been going on, but that doesn't mean it need remain 
quiet if things are now going to be moving.
