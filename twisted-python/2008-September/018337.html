I agree with Chris and JP here: I certainly plan to discuss XMPP issues 
here on the main Twisted mailing list.  I _want_ to &quot;drag&quot; these folks 
into general Twisted discussions - and with over 1000 people on this 
list already, with a hugely divergent array of interests in Twisted, 
somehow I am guessing those 50 won't need to be dragged too hard :).

There is still a lot to be decided as to how Twisted's XMPP code will 
integrate with the rest of Twisted: what is the (protocol-agnostic) 
common domain model for chat?  How should different XMPP components and 
modules use twisted.cred?  I think that these core integration 
mechanisms are a huge part of what makes Twisted great.  These questions 
need to be answered by people who know Twisted's abstractions as well as 
those who know XMPP's.

What to do with the twisted-jabber mailing list is certainly up to you, 
and perhaps current discussion of wokkel, palaver, and idavoll does not 
belong here; but certainly development of twisted.words should be 
discussed in as general a forum as possible.
