<PRE>We're very close on the theory.  My point wasn't to discourage upgrades.
Even regulated entities can and should upgrade their security libraries as
part of their annual audit cycle.  My point was to promote a more
deliberate depreciation cycle with better visibility for regulated entities.

I'm not clear the age of the library we're talking about, but for the sake
of argument consider something like:

   - On Jan 1 every year, we mark the &quot;current&quot; version of the library
   - On Jan 1 two years later, we deprecate everything older than that
   version
   - On Jan 1 three years later, we kill off support for everything before
   that version

The worst case scenario is a library from Dec 31, 2015 is killed on Jan 1,
2018, a two year (plus one day) window.  That would mean a minimum of two
annual cycles to make the upgrade.  It would be easy to plan upgrades. It
would be clear which versions were dying when.

On the flip side, it would strongly discourage use of a library older than
3 years.  Most folks would go from a 1.5 yr old library to a 0.5 yr old
library each year.  Even a luddite (who wanted to guarantee support) would
be replacing a 2.5yr old library with a 1.5yr old library.

</I>&gt;<i>    - Has to work with our lawyers to negotiate Information Security and
</I>&gt;<i>    Business Associate agreements with customers
</I>&gt;<i>    - Has to provide implementation details in request to our customers'

</I>&gt;<i>    so it was top-of-mind for me)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When there's a vulnerability, you can fast track an upgrade because
</I>&gt;<i> there's a non-theoretical risk to doing nothing.  The problem is an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;optional&quot; version bump.  It's all CYA.  If I don't follow my P&amp;P, the
</I>&gt;<i> federal government, state government, and customers all have (extra)
</I>&gt;<i> grounds to sue my company (cofounder so literally *mine*).  If the
</I>&gt;<i> consequence of waiting are a transient Twisted bug or a delayed feature
</I>&gt;<i> depending on a feature in a blocked version, it's an easy choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem with this perspective is that it inappropriately assigns risk
</I>&gt;<i> by default to upgrading but no risk by default to not-upgrading.  For
</I>&gt;<i> example, it is well known that various adversaries stockpile 0-day
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerabilities in popular libraries.  Of course new releases don't ever
</I>&gt;<i> *empty* this stockpile, but they quite often reduce it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Often fixes to this type of secret vulnerability are not identified as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;high severity&quot; because severity classifications are often incorrect,
</I>&gt;<i> almost always in the direction of having a lower severity than they ought
</I>&gt;<i> to.  See for example this paper:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/hotos09/tech/full_papers/arnold/arnold_html/">https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/hotos09/tech/full_papers/arnold/arnold_html/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  It shows that (under the range of data collected, 2006-2008) there is
</I>&gt;<i> _always_ a non-zero number of misclassified bugs impacting &quot;stable&quot; kernel
</I>&gt;<i> versions' security.  The same is almost certainly true of OpenSSL.  Not to
</I>&gt;<i> mention the fact that being stuck on old OpenSSL means being stuck without
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental improvements such as TLS 1.3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, it may be possible to show that there is absolutely always
</I>&gt;<i> a vulnerability being fixed by new versions, even when you are pretty sure
</I>&gt;<i> there isn't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that certain regulatory regimes do still give a huge
</I>&gt;<i> financial incentive to bias your change management decisions towards
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;status quo&quot;; my comment earlier indicated that this is *starting *to
</I>&gt;<i> change, not that that process is complete.  Even if you were to agree with
</I>&gt;<i> me completely it might not be reasonable to risk the entire future of your
</I>&gt;<i> business on a fast upgrade cadence if you are liable for the risks of
</I>&gt;<i> upgrading but not liable for the risks of not-upgrading.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, in a situation with perverse incentives like that, an equally
</I>&gt;<i> significant risk is building a process that punishes even *preparing* to
</I>&gt;<i> make a change.  Inasmuch as it's feasible should always have a codebase
</I>&gt;<i> which is ready to roll out upgraded versions of every dependency, *as if* the
</I>&gt;<i> regulators were to allow the upgrades, because when security researchers
</I>&gt;<i> identify that a vulnerability is high-impact after the fact, you don't want
</I>&gt;<i> to have to make big changes or retrofit your tooling or your codebase in
</I>&gt;<i> the moment of that impact.  Presumably all the governments and the
</I>&gt;<i> customers could still sue you if you hadn't managed to fix e.g. Heartbleed
</I>&gt;<i> after &lt;some span of time that a layperson would think is unreasonable&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another great example of why you want to be ready to upgrade: if you can
</I>&gt;<i> run your tests against a new Twisted in its pre-release week and report a
</I>&gt;<i> regression (or better yet, run continuously against trunk and report
</I>&gt;<i> regressions that affect your code as they occur) then you can offload the
</I>&gt;<i> work of actually keeping your application running onto us, and force us to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid ever releasing a version that breaks you.  But if you only identify
</I>&gt;<i> bugs years after the fact, there's no longer anything we can do except fix
</I>&gt;<i> them with the same priority as everything else.
