<PRE>(disclaimer: this is after several hours on an aeroplane, this may all be nonsense)

So, I'm currently looking into adding some features to twisted.web -- something that historically hasn't had the best support for pluggable reactors, and which requires levels and levels of monkeypatching (see the top level of <A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/compare/trunk...deferreds-in-resrender-3711">https://github.com/twisted/twisted/compare/trunk...deferreds-in-resrender-3711</A> ). So, I was thinking, what if we made a new way for things to get their reactor, rather than extending all these concrete implementations everywhere?

Currently, you'd pass a reactor instance through to protocols by making the factory understand it, and the protocol calling self.factory._reactor or whatever. I never thought this was a supremely helpful or useful interface -- especially for one-shot classes -- so what if instead we made a new IProtocol-extending interface, which signals to tcp.Port/etc that the protocol, once created, should have a reactor set on it (maybe through some &quot;setConnectingReactor&quot; or something). This would mean that the factory doesn't know about the reactor in most cases (with things like HTTPFactory doing logging as an exception) -- but we could also have an IClient/ServerFactoryWithReactor, that Endpoints (which needs to know about the reactor, and which reactor it is listening on) can then check for and call a similar function, telling the Factory what reactor it is actually running under.

This, I think, would reduce a bunch of duplicate code in __init__s of factories, and could be implemented in the base class of Protocol or ServerFactory, possibly. What do people think?
