I don't take it personally.  I do a little coding (hello startup) but I'm
actually the guy who:

   - Had to develop our Policies and Procedures (P&amp;P) in conjunction with
   our Compliance consultant
   - Has to work with our lawyers to negotiate Information Security and
   Business Associate agreements with customers
   - Has to provide implementation details in request to our customers'
   security groups (I spent all day working through a 160 item self-assessment
   so it was top-of-mind for me)

When there's a vulnerability, you can fast track an upgrade because there's
a non-theoretical risk to doing nothing.  The problem is an &quot;optional&quot;
version bump.  It's all CYA.  If I don't follow my P&amp;P, the federal
government, state government, and customers all have (extra) grounds to sue
my company (cofounder so literally *mine*).  If the consequence of waiting
are a transient Twisted bug or a delayed feature depending on a feature in
a blocked version, it's an easy choice.

</I>&gt;<i> I don't object to this specific change (we're on shiny new code), but want
</I>&gt;<i> to offer some food-for-thought:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Is newer really better in cryptography?  Heartbleed affected 1.0.1, but
</I>&gt;<i> not 1.0.0 and there are a bunch of vulnerabilities that only affect the
</I>&gt;<i> newer libraries (<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html">https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html</A>).  It
</I>&gt;<i> even makes sense that the older libraries have been more-thoroughly
</I>&gt;<i> tested... so new code may just mean new vulnerabilities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can understand the point here - that upgrades are not zero-risk - but
</I>&gt;<i> this is a very dangerous line of reasoning.  (I think &quot;in cryptography&quot; you
</I>&gt;<i> really mean the general english word &quot;cryptography&quot; and not like &quot;PyCA™
</I>&gt;<i> Cryptography™&quot;.)  It's dangerous because, as application developers, you
</I>&gt;<i> and I aren't really _qualified_ to evaluate whether newer versions of
</I>&gt;<i> security-critical libraries are more or less secure; the best we can do is
</I>&gt;<i> always, always, always upgrade.  The solution to heartbleed was to upgrade
</I>&gt;<i> to a newer version of 1.0.1, not to roll back to 0.9.8.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More importantly, heartbleed itself is not a general category of defect,
</I>&gt;<i> in the sense that heartbleed itself shone a bright light directly on
</I>&gt;<i> OpenSSL and exposed the real problem, which was massive underinvestment in
</I>&gt;<i> critical security infrastructure.  The issue isn't that upgrading is
</I>&gt;<i> dangerous, it's that letting critical infrastructure decay is dangerous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One way that you can *promote* the decay of critical infrastructure is to
</I>&gt;<i> defer upgrading out of vague fears about the upgrade going poorly rather
</I>&gt;<i> than specific technical issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I should take the opportunity to point out that if you're a professional
</I>&gt;<i> network software developer, you should really be giving a couple of bucks
</I>&gt;<i> to the OpenSSL foundation: &lt;<A HREF="https://www.openssl.org/support/donations.html">https://www.openssl.org/support/donations.html</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> The most direct way to fight the decay of critical infrastructure is to
</I>&gt;<i> fund it with cash money.  (And, for that matter, &lt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/#DonatetoTwisted">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/#DonatetoTwisted</A>&gt;...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) How does this impact regulated industries.  In healthcare (my current
</I>&gt;<i> industry), changing a library (especially cryptography) could mean:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - An internal review to select a new version of the library
</I>&gt;<i>    - An internal change management process
</I>&gt;<i>    - Technical testing (perhaps a 3rd party audit)
</I>&gt;<i>    - A notification to clients of the change
</I>&gt;<i>    - Secondary reviews/testing at clients
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The intensity of this process depends on the risk level of the system and
</I>&gt;<i> this could be a long and complicated process for some organizations.  Seems
</I>&gt;<i> like a more deliberate deprecation policy would make it easier to plan
</I>&gt;<i> ahead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem with a lot of the regulatory standards that require this sort
</I>&gt;<i> of laborious change-control is that during the entire period where all this
</I>&gt;<i> redundant analysis and re-analysis of the change is happening, customers
</I>&gt;<i> are still vulnerable (and in a health care context, this may mean even that
</I>&gt;<i> lives remain at risk!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My (entirely secondhand) understanding is that recognition is dawning in
</I>&gt;<i> many compliance fields (HIPPA, PCI-DSS, SOX) that there is a mismatch
</I>&gt;<i> between the realities of software development (delay in making changes ==
</I>&gt;<i> risk) and industrial change control (every change == risk), and auditors
</I>&gt;<i> and regulators are beginning to take this into account.  This means that
</I>&gt;<i> the ability to make changes *quickly* to ensure safe operation is slowly
</I>&gt;<i> gaining ground over the ability to delay changes until sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> evaluation has taken place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This recognition is dawning because many of these reviews are, in fact,
</I>&gt;<i> nonsense.  For example: &quot;an internal review to select a new version of the
</I>&gt;<i> library&quot; - does every healthcare project have a qualified cryptographer and
</I>&gt;<i> penetration tester to each independently spend the 6 months of careful code
</I>&gt;<i> audits required to actually evaluate the relative security of new versions
</I>&gt;<i> of OpenSSL, or does this internal review consist mainly of unqualified
</I>&gt;<i> people pontificating about hypothetical risks, divorced from the technical
</I>&gt;<i> realities of the upgrade in question?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My own experience has taught me that fear of changes like this is mostly
</I>&gt;<i> developers being afraid of audit or compliance, rather than audit or
</I>&gt;<i> compliance actually requiring it.  If you tell your auditor &quot;we absolutely
</I>&gt;<i> have to upgrade OpenSSL every week if an update is available&quot;, they'll
</I>&gt;<i> usually figure out a way to do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't mean to jump down your throat here; the tone is definitely harsher
</I>&gt;<i> than I would like, but I want it to be very clear why I have such strong
</I>&gt;<i> feelings about upgrading security-critical dependencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, the Netscape SPKI APIs are disappearing from OpenSSL itself
</I>&gt;<i> eventually, so this specific issue isn't just about upgrading - it's about
</I>&gt;<i> preventing it from being difficult to upgrade in the future.  If we wait
</I>&gt;<i> until the APIs are actually gone, rather than just deprecated, this may
</I>&gt;<i> create friction around a critical security update.
