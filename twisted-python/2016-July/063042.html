<PRE>Hi,

We now have automated tests running on Windows an Appveyor for any PR.

In this way team and non-team member can get some feedback about their
changes... and also see the coverage report for windows.

Some tests are failing on the Appveyor env, while they pass on the the Win7
and Win2012 buildbot slaves.

Here is the ticket <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/8612">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/8612</A>

Keeping buildbot running and Windows slaves running takes a lot of time.

Coverage reports from Windows7 are broken... and I don't know why, while
python processes on Win2012 are left running and some of them using up to
1.2G of memory.

If you care about running Twisted on Windows please consider contributing
to improve the Appveyor test or to manage the Windows slaves.

I was the one pushing for the Win2012, but I don't have time to keep it
running. If someone want to take care of it, please let me know. Otherwise
I will remove it as I don't have time to monitor it and kill stray
processes.

I added Win2012 to get coverage reported from Windows, but now that we have
Appveyor, the Win2012 slave is no longer that important.

Many thanks to Rackspace for sponsoring the Win2012 slave and for Appveyor
providing a great free service.

Regards,
-- 
Adi Roiban
