Whew :).

</I>&gt;<i> When there's a vulnerability, you can fast track an upgrade because there's a non-theoretical risk to doing nothing.  The problem is an &quot;optional&quot; version bump.  It's all CYA.  If I don't follow my P&amp;P, the federal government, state government, and customers all have (extra) grounds to sue my company (cofounder so literally *mine*).  If the consequence of waiting are a transient Twisted bug or a delayed feature depending on a feature in a blocked version, it's an easy choice.

The problem with this perspective is that it inappropriately assigns risk by default to upgrading but no risk by default to not-upgrading.  For example, it is well known that various adversaries stockpile 0-day vulnerabilities in popular libraries.  Of course new releases don't ever empty this stockpile, but they quite often reduce it.

Often fixes to this type of secret vulnerability are not identified as &quot;high severity&quot; because severity classifications are often incorrect, almost always in the direction of having a lower severity than they ought to.  See for example this paper: <A HREF="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/hotos09/tech/full_papers/arnold/arnold_html/">https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/hotos09/tech/full_papers/arnold/arnold_html/</A>  It shows that (under the range of data collected, 2006-2008) there is _always_ a non-zero number of misclassified bugs impacting &quot;stable&quot; kernel versions' security.  The same is almost certainly true of OpenSSL.  Not to mention the fact that being stuck on old OpenSSL means being stuck without fundamental improvements such as TLS 1.3.

In other words, it may be possible to show that there is absolutely always a vulnerability being fixed by new versions, even when you are pretty sure there isn't.

I understand that certain regulatory regimes do still give a huge financial incentive to bias your change management decisions towards &quot;status quo&quot;; my comment earlier indicated that this is starting to change, not that that process is complete.  Even if you were to agree with me completely it might not be reasonable to risk the entire future of your business on a fast upgrade cadence if you are liable for the risks of upgrading but not liable for the risks of not-upgrading.

However, in a situation with perverse incentives like that, an equally significant risk is building a process that punishes even preparing to make a change.  Inasmuch as it's feasible should always have a codebase which is ready to roll out upgraded versions of every dependency, as if the regulators were to allow the upgrades, because when security researchers identify that a vulnerability is high-impact after the fact, you don't want to have to make big changes or retrofit your tooling or your codebase in the moment of that impact.  Presumably all the governments and the customers could still sue you if you hadn't managed to fix e.g. Heartbleed after &lt;some span of time that a layperson would think is unreasonable&gt;.

Another great example of why you want to be ready to upgrade: if you can run your tests against a new Twisted in its pre-release week and report a regression (or better yet, run continuously against trunk and report regressions that affect your code as they occur) then you can offload the work of actually keeping your application running onto us, and force us to avoid ever releasing a version that breaks you.  But if you only identify bugs years after the fact, there's no longer anything we can do except fix them with the same priority as everything else.
