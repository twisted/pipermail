</I>&gt;<i> So, I'm currently looking into adding some features to twisted.web -- something that historically hasn't had the best support for pluggable reactors, and which requires levels and levels of monkeypatching (see the top level of <A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/compare/trunk...deferreds-in-resrender-3711">https://github.com/twisted/twisted/compare/trunk...deferreds-in-resrender-3711</A> ). So, I was thinking, what if we made a new way for things to get their reactor, rather than extending all these concrete implementations everywhere?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, you'd pass a reactor instance through to protocols by making the factory understand it, and the protocol calling self.factory._reactor or whatever. I never thought this was a supremely helpful or useful interface -- especially for one-shot classes -- so what if instead we made a new IProtocol-extending interface, which signals to tcp.Port/etc that the protocol, once created, should have a reactor set on it (maybe through some &quot;setConnectingReactor&quot; or something). This would mean that the factory doesn't know about the reactor in most cases (with things like HTTPFactory doing logging as an exception) -- but we could also have an IClient/ServerFactoryWithReactor, that Endpoints (which needs to know about the reactor, and which reactor it is listening on) can then check for and call a similar function, telling the Factory what reactor it is actually running under.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This, I think, would reduce a bunch of duplicate code in __init__s of factories, and could be implemented in the base class of Protocol or ServerFactory, possibly. What do people think?
</I>

First off, I think a clearer articulation of the problem would be helpful :).  Is it &quot;I don't want to take parameters in __init__&quot;?  Or &quot;I don't want to have duplicated code to grab the global reactor everywhere, but I still want to grab the global reactor everywhere&quot;?  Is it &quot;most factories don't need the reactor except to hand it to their protocols, therefore they shouldn't have to have code to deal with it at all&quot;?

I definitely don't think we should address any of these issues with 'setConnectedReactor'.  This is using a side-effect rather than just constructing the object with the things that it needs.  We also shouldn't do it with a base class.  Depending even more on inheritance would be movement in the wrong direction.

If we want to address the issue of duplicated code in constructors, how about something like a @reactorParameter(name='reactor') decorator, which does the grab-the-current-global-reactor-if-it's-not-passed thing?  A better pattern is 'just pass in the reactor', of course.

Or, perhaps what you want is this 7-year-old ticket? :) <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3205">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3205</A>
