Hi Eric,

We generally don't issue new pre-releases for issues that are not regressions.  Thomas is the release manager in this case so it is his call, but it would be nice to get the 12.* releases all out within 2012 :).  I think it'd be a lot better to focus on this for 13.0, and try to push for 13.0 to be released sooner rather than 12.3 to be released later.

Not only is this ticket not a regression, and is OpenBSD not a supported platform for Twisted, but it looks like we don't even have an un-supported builder for that platform, so other developers would have a hard time reviewing the ticket without setting up their own personal virtualization infrastructure.  In the meanwhile you might want to consider provisioning and contributing an OpenBSD buildbot, so we can start the process of transitioning it from unsupported to supported.

As far as getting your ticket reviewed, The best way to get your tickets reviewed is to do code reviews for other people, so that when a reviewer with some free time comes around, you'll be first in the queue.  Unfortunately it looks like your ticket is dead last at the moment, so clearing out any other reviews would be extra helpful in its case!

Since clearing the _whole_ queue is probably an impossible amount of effort, personally I'd be happy to offer you the same deal that Martin van L&#246;wis pioneered on the Python core mailing list: if you do five code reviews, I'll review a ticket of your choice, virtualization infrastructure hassles notwithstanding :).
