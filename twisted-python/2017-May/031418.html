FWIW this kind of thing was, more or less, what I was thinking. It seems 
unlikely that stealing the TCP connection from Response for a few bytes 
was wise...

IIUC IResponse.deliverBody *does* guarantee (currently) to provide a 
transport implementing IPushProducer to the supplied IProtocol, at least 
as far as the docstring says?

Obviously that doesn't make accessing the private _transport safe - an 
implementation could wrap the transport to implement the IPushProducer 
semantics.

Thanks for confirming this. I suspected as much, but was not certain (I 
make relatively little use of producer/consumer APIs in my own code).

</I>
How does that square with deliverBody providing an IPushProducer? Is it 
the case that the transport may just disobey the pauseProducing requests 
as you've noted above?
