Juggling with buffering/data by hand seems even more risky to me.
Your implementation seems to do things which twisted should do, which 
(also) doesn't seem to be right. :)
It would be nice if this could be solved in an elegant way.

</I>It seems to do what I want to do. :)

BTW (without reading it), I've tried your solution (thank you very much 
for it!).
 From a 1073741824 bytes source file, it transferred a 1056490639 
destination file.
Another run made a 1044534695 bytes destination file.
Well, each run yields a different size.
