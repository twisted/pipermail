Aah.  That's a very good reason, come to think of it.  Maybe we should default to daemon threads at some point in the future, for that matter; it would make exiting easier, by allowing us to still join() all the threads, but still exit if attempting to do so times out.

Trusty is shipping Twisted 13.2 which doesn't have vital TLS improvements that arrived with 14.0 and that are used in said example.

I strongly recommend against using Twisted older than 14.0 for code involving TLS.  Please use the version from PyPI (14.0.2).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] porting twisted.spread to Python3
Message-ID: <4121201.VS1rzsEyV3@i5>

I now have a local git branch with about 70 commits, always 
rebased onto current trunk.

Those test suites pass with Python2 and Python3:

test_banana, test_jelly, test_pb, test_pbfailure, test_persisted

I also have a real app using PB (kajongg, a KDE game). Running
the server and the client with any combination of Python 2 and
Python 3 works but more testing is needed there. Especially
transferring failures with non-ascii test, so I need to inject
random errors.

spread.banana is now fully covered by tests (was at 85% before).
There is still a lot of code in twisted.spread which has no
tests yet.
I do not think I want to add missing tests for everything,
only for those regions where I do changes or where it is not
too difficult. And of course if an application triggers a bug
yet uncovered by tests.

Can you point me to other PB applications I could use for testing?
Preferrably ones that are already mostly compatible with PY3
themselves, but that is not a _must_, I would try porting them
unless it turns out to be too much work. And preferrably ones
developed by people with a non-ascii native language. I do not
yet trust Failures and logging with non-ascii.


Below is the current list of commits. Everything you see
there is still much in flux. This includes shuffling code
between commits, combining and splitting commits, changing order.
I want to open one ticket per commit. Simple things hopefully 
not needing much discussion first.

Estimating one week per review/commit to trunk, this process 
will take more than one year. Often I can only add a new ticket
after the previous one has been integrated because they 
depend on each other.

So if it really seems to take that long, at some point I might
just decide to put what I have to github and not care anymore.
Which of course means I might have to distribute a patched
twisted version with my application. I really want to leave
Python2 behind, and only twisted is in the way. Latest versions
of KDE do not have Python2 bindings anymore (KDE Frameworks 5).

This log of course includes things being in tickets up for review.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] my branches merged by you (itamar)
Message-ID: <2059527.qlDuKEiMrr@i5>

Thanks for fixing my mistakes!

Based on your fixes I started a personal checklist, see below.
Is that list correct so far? (it will not include things I already
did right)

I noticed that you also changed 'x' to b'x' in some places. I did
not do that yet because it is not needed for those tickets, I wanted
to keep them small and focussed.

Instead I am planning tickets for just that: (after minimizing the
number of places to be fixed)
twisted.spread.banana and tests: literal strings become bytes where appropriate
twisted.spread.jelly and tests: define *_atom consistently for all atoms, change them to bytes
twisted.spread.pb and tests: literal strings become bytes where appropriate

The current checklist:

Line length max. 79
*.rst doc: One line per sentence, no length limit
fully qualified names in doc and news, twisted.*
no __ in Twisted. Everything in a test case is private anyway.
if possible __execute__ (not __define__) only one assert per test
document changed API like raising more or different exceptions
use new print() formatting syntax
Document and isolate test code using the private API of the module to be tested.
test everything with PY2.6 too
did twistedchecker add new warnings?
news: most frequent form: Qualified now does ...
news about spread belong into twisted/topfiles
doc: not pb but PB
Epydoc
docstring ends with point
break docstring lines not sooner than needed
avoid the word ?test? in test docstrings
do not use the ?I am? form in docstrings
test docstring: describe what happens, including exceptions
doc: avoid mentioning the private API

It makes me sad to learn you're carrying so many patches to Twisted.  It 
might be useful to the project if you could share why this development 
was easier to do outside the tree rather than contributing it to the 
project as you developed it.

For testing?  Probably not random - instead, comprehensive.

The coding standard only requires you to add tests for code you're 
changing.  Python 3 mixes things up a bit though - by changing 
everything.  Calling a module "Python 3 compatible" without changing it 
at all still changes lots of things how about it works.

I think that before the Twisted project wants to call a particular 
module ported, we want it to have test coverage that can run on Python 
3.

I'll let other people volunteer projects they know of - but I strongly 
suspect there are few or no such applications.

If twisted.spread were completely supported on Python 3 in only another 
year I'll be very impressed. :)

That's too bad.

Again, it seems unfortunate that you have all of this work ... 
somewhere.  Somewhere only you  (as far as I can tell) can see it. 
Somewhere only you can test it.  Somewhere only you can work on it and 
get it contributed to Twisted.

I think I only did this where new uses of 'x' was being introduced to 
represent a bytes object.  My goal is for new code being added to be as 
correct as possible so that it doesn't increase the burden of making 
these fixes later.  The time when the code is being first introduced is 
the time when it's easiest to make sure these things are correct.

Hmm.  Yes?  I'm not sure.  What do you have in mind here?

This is just my personal style of development. A bit chaotic. Sometimes
trial and error. And really a lot of git rebase -i. Whenever I find
some necessary or helpful change that could be done before porting,
put that at the top of the patch list and readjust everything.
The methodic part comes last: Look at what I changed, rethink why that
is really needed, and look for similar places I overlooked. Then generate
tickets for things that seem ready.

BTW what about Ticket 7628, news extension "port"? I could soon start
feeding porting tickets but if this extension is useful, I guess it
should be applied first.

I was afraid you'd say that.
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Plan/Python3 does not explicitly
say so, maybe this should be changed. I can do that, but then I
have no write permission for the wiki.

That makes me wonder if I really should have used PB at all. But
now I do and have no plans to change that.

I believe I saw some mailing list posts where many years ago somebody
said he has spread running with PY3 but as it seems nothing of that
got into trunk. Be assured that I want to avoid that.

What is the preferred place for Twisted public repositories?
No svn please, only git.

But first I want to do some more cleaning and reshuffling, I cannot
really do that anymore with commits already pushed to a public
repository. Maybe 2 or 3 weeks.

Then I would not have mentioned this. Three such changes in svn r43220.
b'remote' and two banana encoded strings. I knowingly left it at 'remote'
because I wanted to change that everywhere together.

I fully agree. Excluding cases where you just re-use an existing string
in one more place because then you have both 'remote' and b'remote'
in the source until you change them all (for that you have to grep
everything anyway). On the other hand, not adapting existing code
to changed guidelines right when they are changed always generates
a lot of such inconsistencies, so this one is really peanuts.
(I know - more manpower is always needed). This is actually a small
problem for me because I rather copy the style of existing code 
instead of reading boring guidelines.

svn r43207 Split up the test with multiple assertions into several tests

There you unfolded the loop. If the real reason was the different 
constructions of the type names (like "__builtin__.type"), I would
have expected a different commit text, and of course you could have
left the loop, like

for obj, name in ((type, '__builtin__.typ'), ...)

So I assumed that you really want as few assertions executed in one
test as possible. I cannot think of any other reason than those two.

BTW your commit "epytext" fixes most but not all. There are still a
few ``xxx`` left. What markup language did you have in mind there?

Cases like svn r43221

Hoist the use of this private API to a single location in a helper function.

which explains why we need to use the private API.

Ah.  I didn't think anyone was paying any attention to the plan anymore 
(and I've run out of energy to try to get people to stick to it).

For example, following the plan, I would have expected to see perhaps 
two patches to port the banana module: one to add the missing test 
coverage and one to make any and all changes necessary to get the test 
suite to pass on Python 3.

(Note, I'm just pointing this out for the sake of clarity.  I'm not 
complaining about the tickets/patches you recently contributed.  As I 
said, I'm out of energy for that).

As far as wiki access goes, I'm not clear on how those permissions work 
anymore.  Perhaps someone else can chime in.  If not, consider asking on 
#twisted-dev.

Sorry about this.  For anyone who's reading and thinking about starting 
a project, I personally recommend you not use PB.  It's almost certainly 
not the right tool to solve the problem you have (if you think your 
problem is so unique and challenging it needs a tool like PB, maybe it 
is!  Feel free to start a discussion about the specifics on this list. 
Maybe you've got one of the rare problems where PB makes sense.)

Anywhere public.  Collaboration can't take place when things are 
private.

Pushing something isn't a promise not to abandoning, screw it up, rebase 
it, delete it later, whatever.

I think that the notion that before something is shared it has to be 
carefully arranged and re-arranged to make it look like it was developed 
by an all-knowing, all-programming super being.

Real software doesn't get built one perfect, self-contained step at a 
time.  The construction of real software is messy.

Hm.  You're right on two counts.  The lines:

    undecodable = b'\x7f' * 65 + b'\x85'
and

    decodable = b'\x01\x81'

were not related to the change.  I'm not sure why I decided to make 
those changes.  If I were doing it again now, I wouldn't.

But I'll stick by the decision to write `b'remote'` instead of 
`'remote'` on the line:

    vocab = b'remote'

Impossible. test_jelly imports pb, test_pb imports jelly.

But I can of course reduce the number of tickets related to porting and
put more than one patchfile into them.

That doesn't mean it's impossible.  It just means you may also have to 
shuffle some files around.

Note that my point isn't that we need to reduce the number of tickets 
related to porting or that there should be more than one patch to 
resolve any one ticket (there shouldn't be).

The point is that the documented porting plan is to port module by 
module, not Python 3 incompatible change by Python 3 incompatible 
change.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Client Logic
Message-ID: <786CDC73-43AA-4811-B992-B3817BC5D843@gmail.com>

Folks,

I?m writing an client using twisted, and I?m basing it off the Poetry client from http://krondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/twisted-intro.html.
I am porting a previous pyserial based client, so I?m running into new territory here.

And it?s working fine, there are two ?issues" that I am running into.

class WT_Protocol(Protocol):

   tag = ''

   def to_bytes(self, seq):
       """convert a sequence to a bytes type"""
       #
       #   from pyserial.util
       if isinstance(seq, bytes):
           return seq
       elif isinstance(seq, bytearray):
           return bytes(seq)
       elif isinstance(seq, memoryview):
           return seq.tobytes()
       else:
           b = bytearray()
           for item in seq:
               b.append(item)  # this one handles int and str for our emulation and ints for Python 3.x
           return bytes(b)

   def connectionMade(self):
       print "Reseting the network"
       reset = self.to_bytes(packets.network_reset() )
       self.transport.write ( reset )
       self.transport.write ( self.to_bytes(packets.Set_SiteCode(NodeID=255, SC1=0, SC2=0, SC3=0) ))
       self.transport.write ( self.to_bytes(packets.Set_Gain_Packet(NodeID=255, Gain=1) ))    # high gain
       self.transport.write ( self.to_bytes(packets.Set_Protocol_No_Nulls (NetworkID=0, ReceiverID=0, NodeID=1) ))    # high gain
       time.sleep (.5)

Now the client works right now, but I?m concerned that I can?t figure out how to immediately read for a reply packet from the server.

For example, when I send the Set_SiteCode packet, I may receive a reply.  

But how would that occur in the Twisted framework?  In my testing the dataReceived function is not being called, so I can?t trap it there, plus I?m not sure how I would figure that logic.

Can anyone suggest a method to do this?

The second question, as far as I can tell, isn?t very solvable.  I?d like to add a ?Press Q to quit? type logic to the code.  But I don?t see a way to do this easily in twisted?  (platform unspecific, but it?s running Mac OS X / Unix right now).

First, if you want to "immediately" do anything, you really need to delete that "time.sleep(.5)" line from your code.  It will block the whole reactor from getting work done :).

> For example, when I send the Set_SiteCode packet, I may receive a reply.  
>

dataReceived will be called with the data when it arrives.  If you're expecting the data that is being sent to be a reply to some message, you should have the code that sends that message return a Deferred; that's what Deferreds are for, representing request/response patterns.

> In my testing the dataReceived function is not being called, so I can?t trap it there, plus I?m not sure how I would figure that logic.

If dataReceived is not getting called, you're not getting data, so no reply has been sent.  You haven't included enough of your program for me to tell why no data is getting sent, though.  Presumably you've got some stuff hooking up your serial port and running the reactor, but without seeing how that works, I can't even guess at what's wrong.

> Can anyone suggest a method to do this?

dataReceived it is :).

> The second question, as far as I can tell, isn?t very solvable.  I?d like to add a ?Press Q to quit? type logic to the code.  But I don?t see a way to do this easily in twisted?  (platform unspecific, but it?s running Mac OS X / Unix right now).

Where do you want to press "Q"?  Do you mean you want to pop up a GUI, or wait for the user to type a "Q" in a Terminal window, or do you mean you want the thing on the other end of the serial port to send a "Q"?  Also, what is "UNIX"?

If anyone has some free time to review it, this would make other code-reviews go just a little bit faster, since reviewers wouldn't need to keep looking at the logs for that builder to make sure that the failures are the "expected" ones; all the builders should be consistently green except for the pesky windows XP one.

Done. Not reviewed for style guide compliance, and I haven't run it locally
or on the build slaves. Hope this helps.

Thanks very much for having a look at this!  I'll address the feedback.

You shouldn't need to review for style-guide compliance, as that's the twistedchecker buildbot's job.  Which, I should mention, is green on the branch :).

Also, I already ran the buildbots.  You can quickly investigate their results by looking at the "buildbot" link in the "branch" field of the ticket description.

Armed with these two additional pieces of information, would you be willing to turn this comment into a passing review? ;-)

Thanks again.

If that was intended to be a full review though, you did leave out one important step:

As documented in <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReviewProcess#Howtobeagoodreviewer>,

When you're done with the review, always say what the next step should be: for example, if the author is a committer, can they commit after making a few minor fixes? If your review feedback is more substantial, should they re-submit for another review?

It looks like a "address these minor issues and merge" review, but given that you said you didn't have time to look at certain things, I don't want to make any assumptions.

Message-ID: <20141008192341.17800.2053172312.divmod.xquotient.1235@top>

Hello all,

I'm happy to invite you to a Twisted sprint on Saturday, November 1st
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  ClusterHQ will be hosting up to twenty
(20) Twisted sprinters at the Cambridge Innovation Center ("Coronet
City" room) in Kendall Square from 10AM until 11PM.  The sprint topics
are attendee choice - hacking on any part of Twisted is welcome.  A
large part of the ClusterHQ team will be taking part in the sprint.

ClusterHQ is developing Flocker, a data management tool for use with
Docker written in Python and based on Twisted.  Follow us on Github:

    https://github.com/clusterhq/flocker

ClusterHQ will provide lunch and dinner (something like delivery
pizza, comment on the meetup page if you'd like to suggest
something!).

Find details and chat about sprint topics at the Boston Twisted Python
meetup page:

    http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Twisted-Python/

Early birds, feel free to contact me off-list about meeting up for 
coffee at
around 9AM before the sprint starts.

Space at CIC is limited.  Please RSVP on the Meetup page!

See you there,
Jean-Paul

Apologies.  I got sidetracked preparing for PyTexas (which was last
weekend).  I'll try to get back to it ASAP.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Call For Participation: a review rally before the
	race!
Message-ID: <B7B4598E-7098-48EC-A1F2-7907E67C52AE@twistedmatrix.com>

On November 1, ClusterHQ is going to be hosting a Twisted sprint in Boston.

One of the things that tends to put a damper on such events is the perpetual backlog of tickets in review, many of which have been there seemingly forever.

I would like to propose that we - the whole Twisted community, but especially Twisted committers - give these sprinters a morale boost, by giving them a clean slate, review-queue wise.  This will let them focus on developing cool new stuff, getting a release out, fixing gnarly old bugs, or whatever strikes their fancy, instead of just grinding through reviews the whole time, or feeling bad about leaving those reviews outstanding.

Right now, we have 58 tickets in review.

<https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/report/25>

Here's my proposal:

I am looking for at least 4 volunteers for a "review rally" starting on Monday, October 13.  If each of 5 reviewers (the 4 volunteers, plus myself) can review 2 tickets per day for one week, until Sunday, October 19, we can clear 70 tickets, which should take care of the existing 58 tickets currently queued up, plus any that get resubmitted during that week.

While some volunteers should be Twisted committers since we have plenty of pending contributions from non-committers that need review, there are at least 11 tickets in review from core contributors right now, so non-committer volunteers are equally appreciated!

Of course, if we get 9 volunteers, then each reviewer only has to do one ticket per day, an even more tractable goal.  And so on into the higher numbers :-).

Who is with me?!?!

-glyph

P.S.: While you should of course do this out of its self-evident merit, I do plan to recognize participation in some way, at least with a commemorative page on twistedmatrix.com, and possibly also with something a little goofy like a Mozilla Open Badge :-).

No problem.  Thank you for the review!  It's been landed.

Now the only remaining persistent build failure issue is <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3404>...

Thanks HawkOwl!  I'm looking forward to it.  Congrats on being the fastest volunteer :-).

You should be doing reviews anyway (shouldn't we all?) and part of my hope for this is that if we make a periodic concerted push to get the numbers down from the dizzying heights they've jumped to, it will be a lot more satisfying to do reviews more informally later, because there won't be such a discouragingly long list that it's hard to make a dent in.

Thanks Chris, your participation is much appreciated!

Now we've got:

1. me
2. hawkowl
3. chris wolfe

Have you done reviews before?  Before the week starts you should definitely familiarize yourself with <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReviewProcess> and make sure you know what to do.  Please feel free to reach out if this documentation is in any way unclear (we definitely know it's not the best).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] client logic
Message-ID: <EADCB268-13A7-46D9-9B0C-D1441B7E5F9D@schollnick.net>

I?m sorry if this is a duplicate?  I sent this earlier, but I don?t see it in the archives?

Folks,

I?m writing an client using twisted, and I?m basing it off the Poetry client from http://krondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/twisted-intro.html.
I am porting a previous pyserial based client, so I?m running into new territory here.

And it?s working fine, there are two ?issues" that I am running into.

class WT_Protocol(Protocol):

   tag = ''

   def to_bytes(self, seq):
       """convert a sequence to a bytes type"""
       #
       #   from pyserial.util
       if isinstance(seq, bytes):
           return seq
       elif isinstance(seq, bytearray):
           return bytes(seq)
       elif isinstance(seq, memoryview):
           return seq.tobytes()
       else:
           b = bytearray()
           for item in seq:
               b.append(item)  # this one handles int and str for our emulation and ints for Python 3.x
           return bytes(b)

   def connectionMade(self):
       print "Reseting the network"
       reset = self.to_bytes(packets.network_reset() )
       self.transport.write ( reset )
       self.transport.write ( self.to_bytes(packets.Set_SiteCode(NodeID=255, SC1=0, SC2=0, SC3=0) ))
       self.transport.write ( self.to_bytes(packets.Set_Gain_Packet(NodeID=255, Gain=1) ))    # high gain
       self.transport.write ( self.to_bytes(packets.Set_Protocol_No_Nulls (NetworkID=0, ReceiverID=0, NodeID=1) ))    # high gain
       time.sleep (.5)

Now the client works right now, but I?m concerned that I can?t figure out how to immediately read for a reply packet from the server.

For example, when I send the Set_SiteCode packet, I may receive a reply.  

But how would that occur in the Twisted framework?  In my testing the dataReceived function is not being called, so I can?t trap it there, plus I?m not sure how I would figure that logic.

Can anyone suggest a method to do this?

The second question, as far as I can tell, isn?t very solvable.  I?d like to add a ?Press Q to quit? type logic to the code.  But I don?t see a way to do this easily in twisted?  (platform unspecific, but it?s running Mac OS X / Unix right now).

I'd been planning on getting into doing more reviews, and this is as
good an excuse as any to get started. Monday I'll be travelling, but
I'll try to participate for the rest of the week.

Interesting.  Sorry about that.

I need to confirm this, but I believe I see what is happening now.  Glyph?s reply was quite helpful, I?ll look into the defers.

Thanks for the help.

Every little bit helps - and you can always review 4 tickets on Tuesday to catch up ;-).

Thanks a lot for volunteering!

This is awesome.  Thanks again to everyone for volunteering.  I am looking forward to a big leap forward in contributor responsiveness next week :-D.

But it would be even more awesome if you added your name to this list!

Again as per <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CompatibilityPolicy#ProcedureforExceptionstothisPolicy>, in order to conclude this discussion, I need to provide Twisted users with a branch to test their code against.  Well, now you have it - and as per the policy you have a week from the sending of this message to register any objections :).

The ticket <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2673> is in review now, and the branch is <desynchronize-2673-2>.

Many of the existing tests used some of the compatibility features that we discussed previously, so I just left the existing tests intact.  However, if you need any more compatibility features, please let me know and I can implement them in the branch.  Feel free to reply here, or comment there.

I just tested my threadpool statistics collection code against that branch, and it works perfectly! Thanks a lot for your effort in this branch.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] spread: differences between remote_ and
	perspective_ needing an explanation
Message-ID: <27709999.CuWcHncEeD@i5>

Hi,

while trying to isolate a bug in my app, I found some strange
differences between the implementations of remote_* and perspective_*.

1. in pb.Broker.serialize(), those attributes are set and restored:
   jellyMethod, jellyArgs, jellyKw. Within twisted
   Those attributes are not used anywhere. I grepped, and I ran the
   test suite without those. Is there some code outside of twisted
   using this? What for? Or is there a need for avoiding garbage
   collection? (which would need some explanation).

   My theory is that it was forgotten to remove them when doing
   svn commit 1448: Before, they were actually used in 
   _NetJellier._jelly_instance, but no more after this commit.


2. Those implementations differ:
	remote_*: return broker.serialize(state, self.perspective)
   	perspective_*: return broker.serialize(state, self, method, args, kw)
   	view_*: return broker.serialize(state, self.perspective, method, args, kw)
   	observe_*: return broker.serialize(state, None, method, args, kw)

   Can you please explain why remote_* is implemented differently?
   This goes back to before the first import to svn, so I cannot 
   browse the history.


3. They all raise AttributeError for undefined method except remote_*
   which raises MethodNotFound. Both are not documented in the API.
   Could this be unified to MethodNotFound?

   My theory is that svn commit 13473 was incomplete. Commit message was:

	Raise NoSuchMethod instead of AttributeError when call is made to remote_
   	method that doesn't exist

I was unclear, what I want to know is only why args, kw are not passed for remote_*.

Either way, I am interested in reviewing code, if there is a way for a

I'll see if I can crank through a couple of tickets, but this week is...not
a good week for me.

Of course, Twisted might be a good distraction from work annoyances.

It's unlikely I'll get through more than a handful over the week, but I
figure a handful is better than none.

Although I'm a non-committer, I'll pop-in during the week :)
I wanted to give Adiroiban's cleanup tickets a review anyway.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Serializing cftp and ssh sessions
Message-ID: <86A36C5B-6A8A-4A7C-AF45-8D6D6E324B31@Chaos1.DE>

I have adapted t.c.s.cftp and one of the ssh examples to transfer files to a remote host and than execute some commands there.
Both has to be done for several remote hosts in sequence.
Start of the ssh session has to wait until the cftp sessions are complete and after that has completed, the cftp session for the next host has to be started . . .

The cftp part begins so:

def distributeStuff(host, tasks):
    . . .
    doConnect(reactor, options, tasks)


def doConnect(reactor, options, tasks):
    . . .
    conn.tasks = tasks
    vhk = verifyHostKey
    uao = SSHUserAuthClient(options['user'], options, conn)
    connect(host, port, options, vhk, uao).addErrback(_ebExit)

class SSHConn(connection.SSHConnection):
    def serviceStarted(self):
        self.openChannel(SSHSession())

I played with inlineCallbacks but could not find a point where to place my yielded function.
I tried to overwrite channelClosed in SSHConn:

    def channelClosed(self, channel):
        super(SSHConn, self).channelClosed(channel)
        if len(self.channels) == 0:
            print ?[Last channel closed.]'
            # open ssh ssession:
            . . .
 but that gave an unhandled error:
2014-10-14 07:54:34+0200 [SSHService ssh-connection on SSHClientTransport,client] Unhandled Error

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted hangs when using pyapns
Message-ID: <CACL3mTA9wxFoSwy0DYPB-29A_+3ycfz0X7Q3FmzKPh03zkuZcw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
   I don't know if here is the right place.
I hit a problem with pyapns which is based on twisted.

So, I get code from our parter and setup up env involving interacting with
APNS for IOS pushing work.

I hit the problem that twisted hangs after a while's idle, I mean, when I
start twisted with command:
twistd -r epoll web --class=pyapns.server.APNSServer --port=7077

Then, raise an notification to IOS device by pyapns(
https://github.com/samuraisam/pyapns),it's OK.

However, if I let the system alone for a while, then, new raised
notifications are all failed, what's more, if now I kill twisted process,
and restart with the above command again, push operations are successful
again.

I use python2.7 and twisted 14.0.0 on Redhat6.4.

So, anyone has hit this problem?

Thanks.
Wesley

Hey  Ni

I can not relate to your specific problem. But where I work, we have a
pyapns server in place for push notifications. What we have learned is
that the v50 branch of the repo is much more stable than the code in
master. So maybe give v50 a try, notice that a new rest api is used in
v50.

To run it, you need to prepare some files in /tmp and select a host to which you have ssh access via public key.
If you comment out the call to ssh.executeRemoteCommands in test, sftp.distributeFiles should complete successfully if you run test.
Commenting out the call to sftp.distributeFiles, allows the call to ssh.executeRemoteCommands to do its work, but it does not exit.

pyapns uses threads very heavily, and so my guess would be most likely that you're calling a Twisted API from a non-main thread.  Without seeing the code it's impossible to say.

There's some Twisted-based apache2-licensed APNS integration code available here: <https://trac.calendarserver.org/browser/CalendarServer/trunk/calendarserver/push/applepush.py>.  Unfortunately it is a little bound up with internal implementation details of calendar server, but it's almost generic and it might be worth the effort to extract, since it will almost certainly give you more robust behavior than integrating pyapns and Twisted.

I honestly have no idea.  If you think this is buggy and you'd like to change it, please feel free to propose a change which does so, as long as it's within the bounds of <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CompatibilityPolicy>.

Simply changing this is not OK, because code may be relying upon the existing behavior and we can't just break it.  Again, see <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CompatibilityPolicy>.

That said, we could expose a new public name (something other than Broker, for example) which fixes these bugs, then deprecate the existing name.

Hi,
   The code is from our partner, so currently I won't change their code
until I address this issue.
The used pyapns code is here:  https://github.com/samuraisam/pyapns
And start twisted service by command :  twistd -r epoll web
--class=pyapns.server.APNSServer --port=7077

And start twisted service by command :  twistd -r epoll web
--class=pyapns.server.APNSServer --port=7077

And here is function of our code to do push action:
def __send_push(push_app_id, org_apns_cert, device_apns_token, payload):
    """
    This method will send the actual push to the device, it will first try
to send assuming we already have
    provisioned this org cert, if it fails if will provision, this way we
don't create too many connections
    """
    pyapns.configure({'HOST': MDM_PYAPNS_HOST})
    try:
        pyapns.notify(push_app_id, device_apns_token, payload)
    except UnknownAppID as e:
        # this is an expected exception where connection to this cert is
killed or we are sending this push
        # for the first time, in this case we need to provision first and
then try notify again
        current_app.logger.info(u"Couldn't find app_id for this push, retry
")
        try:
            pyapns.provision(push_app_id, org_apns_cert, 'production')
            pyapns.notify(push_app_id, device_apns_token, payload)
        except Exception as exc:
            current_app.logger.exception(exc)
    except Exception as exc:
        current_app.logger.exception(exc)

Could you please help have a look?

Thanks.
Wesley

OK, you made me curious ;).

I looked through the code, and as it stands, I doubt my original hypothesis (a threading problem) is correct.  Threads are used only in the client talking to the pyapns server, not the pyapns server's client talking to APNS, so they're probably not interfering with it.

As far as I can tell, the ReconnectingClientFactory is set up properly.  Have you looked at the logs?  The one possibility I can think of just from examining the code is that the log messages before calling up to ReconnectingClientFactory.clientConnectionLost are raising an exception, causing the reconnection not to proceed.  That would most likely show a traceback in the logs, though.

<https://github.com/samuraisam/pyapns/blob/master/pyapns/server.py#L157-L164 <https://github.com/samuraisam/pyapns/blob/master/pyapns/server.py#L157-L164>>

Any clue?

I got the point.
server.py:
def write(self, notifications):
    "Connect to the APNS service and send notifications"
    if True: #not self.factory:
      log.msg('APNSService write (connecting)')
      with open('/tmp/wniapns.log','a') as f:
          f.write("#"*20+"\n")
          f.write("apns server1\n")
          f.write("#"*20+"\n")
      server, port = ((APNS_SERVER_SANDBOX_HOSTNAME
                      if self.environment == 'sandbox'
                      else APNS_SERVER_HOSTNAME), APNS_SERVER_PORT)
      self.factory = self.clientProtocolFactory()
      context = self.getContextFactory()
      reactor.connectSSL(server, port, self.factory, context)

    client = self.factory.clientProtocol
   * if client:*
      with open('/tmp/wniapns.log','a') as f:
          f.write("#"*20+"\n")
          f.write("apns server2\n")
          f.write("#"*20+"\n")
      return client.sendMessage(notifications)
    else:
Problem is for twice push to one device, client is not None the second
time, code goes here and error then.

BTW, what I wanna ask is where is the default log file? I didn't see any
exception raised.

I haven't used pyapns and twisted before, I see twisted has lines like
log.msg("xx"), where is the default log file?

Thanks.
Wesley

We're about halfway through the week, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to check in.  Querying Kenaan's declarations from my IRC logs (because I'm lazy and didn't really want to dig into the highscores code to go to the real database), I see:

This is a fairly strong showing - the queue is down to 44 now, down from 58 when this was announced, which is a significant dent - but it does look like we have a little catching up to do!  I would particularly like to nudge Paul and Jonathan to throw their respective hats into the ring, since it looks like we don't have any reviews from them in the official rally period just yet :-).  Sorry if I missed something because this may not be the most reliable data source!

Thanks everyone,

Don't worry, I know I need to do reviews. Have just been running into
intermittent test failures and a local dev environment snafu.

With the command line you mentioned previously, it should be in a file called "twistd.log".

Well, I haven't done as many as I would have liked to have done, but I've

I can't tell if this represents a bug in Twisted or not.  After a quick 
look through the code, I'm not really clear on why the program would 
ever exit (I didn't find the calls to `reactor.stop`, I guess they're 
hidden somewhere in conch "library" code), nor quite which code paths 
you expect to work and which you expect to fail.


What is the expected behavior if I run test.py after editing it to point 
at a host I have access to?

Is that the desired behavior?

If there is a second case, what one edit can I make to observe that 
behavior?  How does the behavior differ from what you're trying to 
achieve?

Separately:

  * You should rewrite this code to not use twisted.conch.client.connect. 
That's some random library code no one ever expected application code to 
use.  It's public, so you can use it if you want, but that's no promise 
it's any good.

  * Use twisted.conch.endpoints.SSHCommandClientEndpoint to perform 
`exec` requests

  * Consider pitching in to complete 
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/6617 so you can use the new 
`SSHSubsystemClientEndpoint` API that ticket introduces to set up your 
SFTP connections.

Hi,

I'm trying to run the following program :

from twisted.enterprise import adbapi

dbpool = adbapi.ConnectionPool("MySQLdb", "khalid_sultaln", "root", "mysql")

def xmlValues() :
    return dbpool.runQuery("SELECt * from xml_vaules limit 1")

def printResult(l):
    print type(l)
    print l[0][0]



xmlValues().addCallback(printResult)


But its not printing anything. What exactly i'm doing wrong?

Hi,

You haven?t started the reactor, so nothing has ?started?. It?s just sitting there, waiting for it to be ?spun off?.

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/_downloads/echoclient_ssl.py

Try using react, as detailed in this example ? you should put your code in a similar main() block.

If you put a reactor.stop() at the end of ssh._ebExit, test.py should run to completion after doing the remote file operations and executing the remote commands.

No.
I need a solution where the call to executeRemoteCommands() is delayed until all remote file operations are complete. Similar the next call to distributeFiles (with a different host) must wait until the previous call to executeRemoteCommands has no outstanding operations.

See above. I must synchronize operations at 2 points in a loop.
I tried to do this with callbacks, called at connection shutdown.
What do you think about this?

I looked at endpoints before, but failed to implement public key authentication and a callback when complete.

Thanks for looking into this,

Okay.  I guess I misunderstood part of the problem statement.  I thought 
you wanted it to stop at some point.

That sounds like the correct solution to me.  The simplest way to 
structure your code is to make the APIs for starting these two 
operations return a Deferred that fires when the operation is complete. 
Then you can use these Deferreds to construct the desired control flow 
for starting the operations.

You should be able to do key-based authentication with the endpoint. 
SSHCommandClientEndpoint.newConnection accepts a `keys` argument if you 
want to specify the keys to use explicitly.  It also accepts an 
`agentEndpoint` argument if you instead want to point it at an SSH key 
agent which will perform key operations for it.

The simplest way to structure your code is to make the APIs for starting these two operations return a Deferred that fires when the operation is complete. Then you can use these Deferreds to construct the desired control flow for starting the operations.

I have implemented this in a prototype, which does what I want, simply by calling the next top level operation when one has completed.
Your suggestion would require to handle the Deferred down to the point of connection termination.

Thanks for your support,

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Announcing Eliot 0.5.0: Structured Logging as
	Storytelling
Message-ID: <2e29454d10d1a02cf4f7e55d38703713@itamarst.org>

 

Eliot provides a structured logging and tracing system for Python that
generates log messages describing a forest of nested actions. Actions
start and eventually finish, successfully or not. Log messages thus tell
a story: what happened and what caused it. 

Eliot has first class support for Twisted, including integration with
Trial. 

Eliot is released by ClusterHQ [2], the Data People for Docker(tm), and
is available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/eliot [3]. Documentation is
available at https://eliot.readthedocs.org [4]. 

Here's what your logs might look like before using Eliot: 

Going to validate http://example.com/index.html [1].
Started download attempted.
Download succeeded!
Missing <title> element in "/html/body".
Bad HTML entity in "/html/body/p[2]".
2 validation errors found!

After switching to Eliot you'll get a tree of messages with both message
contents and causal relationships encoded in a structured format: 

	* {"action_type": "validate_page", "action_status": "started", "url":
"http://example.com/index.html [1]"} 

 	* {"action_type": "download", "action_status": "started"}
 	* {"action_type": "download", "action_status": "succeeded"}

	* {"action_type": "validate_html", "action_status": "started"} 

 	* {"message_type": "validation_error", "error_type": "missing_title",
"xpath": "/html/head"}
 	* {"message_type": "validation_error", "error_type": "bad_entity",
"xpath": "/html/body/p[2]"}

 	* {"action_type": "validate_html", "action_status": "failed",
"exception": "validator.ValidationFailed"}

 	* {"action_type": "validate_page", "action_status": "failed",
"exception": "validator.ValidationFailed"}

What's New in 0.5.0: 

 	* Added support for Python 3.4.
 	* Most public methods and functions now have underscore-based
equivalents to the camel case versions, e.g. eliot.write_traceback and
eliot.writeTraceback, for use in PEP 8 styled programs. Twisted-facing
APIs and pyunit assertions do not provide these additional APIs, as
camel-case is the native idiom.
 	* eliot.to_file outputs log messages to a file.
 	* Documented how to load Eliot logging into ElasticSearch via
Logstash.
 	* Documentation has been significantly reorganized.

Aah.  That's a very good reason, come to think of it.  Maybe we should default to daemon threads at some point in the future, for that matter; it would make exiting easier, by allowing us to still join() all the threads, but still exit if attempting to do so times out.

Trusty is shipping Twisted 13.2 which doesn't have vital TLS improvements that arrived with 14.0 and that are used in said example.

I strongly recommend against using Twisted older than 14.0 for code involving TLS.  Please use the version from PyPI (14.0.2).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] porting twisted.spread to Python3
Message-ID: <4121201.VS1rzsEyV3@i5>

I now have a local git branch with about 70 commits, always 
rebased onto current trunk.

Those test suites pass with Python2 and Python3:

test_banana, test_jelly, test_pb, test_pbfailure, test_persisted

I also have a real app using PB (kajongg, a KDE game). Running
the server and the client with any combination of Python 2 and
Python 3 works but more testing is needed there. Especially
transferring failures with non-ascii test, so I need to inject
random errors.

spread.banana is now fully covered by tests (was at 85% before).
There is still a lot of code in twisted.spread which has no
tests yet.
I do not think I want to add missing tests for everything,
only for those regions where I do changes or where it is not
too difficult. And of course if an application triggers a bug
yet uncovered by tests.

Can you point me to other PB applications I could use for testing?
Preferrably ones that are already mostly compatible with PY3
themselves, but that is not a _must_, I would try porting them
unless it turns out to be too much work. And preferrably ones
developed by people with a non-ascii native language. I do not
yet trust Failures and logging with non-ascii.


Below is the current list of commits. Everything you see
there is still much in flux. This includes shuffling code
between commits, combining and splitting commits, changing order.
I want to open one ticket per commit. Simple things hopefully 
not needing much discussion first.

Estimating one week per review/commit to trunk, this process 
will take more than one year. Often I can only add a new ticket
after the previous one has been integrated because they 
depend on each other.

So if it really seems to take that long, at some point I might
just decide to put what I have to github and not care anymore.
Which of course means I might have to distribute a patched
twisted version with my application. I really want to leave
Python2 behind, and only twisted is in the way. Latest versions
of KDE do not have Python2 bindings anymore (KDE Frameworks 5).

This log of course includes things being in tickets up for review.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] my branches merged by you (itamar)
Message-ID: <2059527.qlDuKEiMrr@i5>

Thanks for fixing my mistakes!

Based on your fixes I started a personal checklist, see below.
Is that list correct so far? (it will not include things I already
did right)

I noticed that you also changed 'x' to b'x' in some places. I did
not do that yet because it is not needed for those tickets, I wanted
to keep them small and focussed.

Instead I am planning tickets for just that: (after minimizing the
number of places to be fixed)
twisted.spread.banana and tests: literal strings become bytes where appropriate
twisted.spread.jelly and tests: define *_atom consistently for all atoms, change them to bytes
twisted.spread.pb and tests: literal strings become bytes where appropriate

The current checklist:

Line length max. 79
*.rst doc: One line per sentence, no length limit
fully qualified names in doc and news, twisted.*
no __ in Twisted. Everything in a test case is private anyway.
if possible __execute__ (not __define__) only one assert per test
document changed API like raising more or different exceptions
use new print() formatting syntax
Document and isolate test code using the private API of the module to be tested.
test everything with PY2.6 too
did twistedchecker add new warnings?
news: most frequent form: Qualified now does ...
news about spread belong into twisted/topfiles
doc: not pb but PB
Epydoc
docstring ends with point
break docstring lines not sooner than needed
avoid the word “test” in test docstrings
do not use the “I am” form in docstrings
test docstring: describe what happens, including exceptions
doc: avoid mentioning the private API

It makes me sad to learn you're carrying so many patches to Twisted.  It 
might be useful to the project if you could share why this development 
was easier to do outside the tree rather than contributing it to the 
project as you developed it.

The coding standard only requires you to add tests for code you're 
changing.  Python 3 mixes things up a bit though - by changing 
everything.  Calling a module "Python 3 compatible" without changing it 
at all still changes lots of things how about it works.

I think that before the Twisted project wants to call a particular 
module ported, we want it to have test coverage that can run on Python 
3.

Again, it seems unfortunate that you have all of this work ... 
somewhere.  Somewhere only you  (as far as I can tell) can see it. 
Somewhere only you can test it.  Somewhere only you can work on it and 
get it contributed to Twisted.

I think I only did this where new uses of 'x' was being introduced to 
represent a bytes object.  My goal is for new code being added to be as 
correct as possible so that it doesn't increase the burden of making 
these fixes later.  The time when the code is being first introduced is 
the time when it's easiest to make sure these things are correct.

This is just my personal style of development. A bit chaotic. Sometimes
trial and error. And really a lot of git rebase -i. Whenever I find
some necessary or helpful change that could be done before porting,
put that at the top of the patch list and readjust everything.
The methodic part comes last: Look at what I changed, rethink why that
is really needed, and look for similar places I overlooked. Then generate
tickets for things that seem ready.

BTW what about Ticket 7628, news extension "port"? I could soon start
feeding porting tickets but if this extension is useful, I guess it
should be applied first.

I was afraid you'd say that.
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Plan/Python3 does not explicitly
say so, maybe this should be changed. I can do that, but then I
have no write permission for the wiki.

That makes me wonder if I really should have used PB at all. But
now I do and have no plans to change that.

I believe I saw some mailing list posts where many years ago somebody
said he has spread running with PY3 but as it seems nothing of that
got into trunk. Be assured that I want to avoid that.

What is the preferred place for Twisted public repositories?
No svn please, only git.

But first I want to do some more cleaning and reshuffling, I cannot
really do that anymore with commits already pushed to a public
repository. Maybe 2 or 3 weeks.

Then I would not have mentioned this. Three such changes in svn r43220.
b'remote' and two banana encoded strings. I knowingly left it at 'remote'
because I wanted to change that everywhere together.

I fully agree. Excluding cases where you just re-use an existing string
in one more place because then you have both 'remote' and b'remote'
in the source until you change them all (for that you have to grep
everything anyway). On the other hand, not adapting existing code
to changed guidelines right when they are changed always generates
a lot of such inconsistencies, so this one is really peanuts.
(I know - more manpower is always needed). This is actually a small
problem for me because I rather copy the style of existing code 
instead of reading boring guidelines.

> Hmm.  Yes?  I'm not sure.  What do you have in mind here?

svn r43207 Split up the test with multiple assertions into several tests

There you unfolded the loop. If the real reason was the different 
constructions of the type names (like "__builtin__.type"), I would
have expected a different commit text, and of course you could have
left the loop, like

for obj, name in ((type, '__builtin__.typ'), ...)

So I assumed that you really want as few assertions executed in one
test as possible. I cannot think of any other reason than those two.

BTW your commit "epytext" fixes most but not all. There are still a
few ``xxx`` left. What markup language did you have in mind there?

Cases like svn r43221

Hoist the use of this private API to a single location in a helper function.

which explains why we need to use the private API.

Ah.  I didn't think anyone was paying any attention to the plan anymore 
(and I've run out of energy to try to get people to stick to it).

For example, following the plan, I would have expected to see perhaps 
two patches to port the banana module: one to add the missing test 
coverage and one to make any and all changes necessary to get the test 
suite to pass on Python 3.

(Note, I'm just pointing this out for the sake of clarity.  I'm not 
complaining about the tickets/patches you recently contributed.  As I 
said, I'm out of energy for that).

As far as wiki access goes, I'm not clear on how those permissions work 
anymore.  Perhaps someone else can chime in.  If not, consider asking on 
#twisted-dev.

Sorry about this.  For anyone who's reading and thinking about starting 
a project, I personally recommend you not use PB.  It's almost certainly 
not the right tool to solve the problem you have (if you think your 
problem is so unique and challenging it needs a tool like PB, maybe it 
is!  Feel free to start a discussion about the specifics on this list. 
Maybe you've got one of the rare problems where PB makes sense.)

Anywhere public.  Collaboration can't take place when things are 
private.

Pushing something isn't a promise not to abandoning, screw it up, rebase 
it, delete it later, whatever.

I think that the notion that before something is shared it has to be 
carefully arranged and re-arranged to make it look like it was developed 
by an all-knowing, all-programming super being.

Real software doesn't get built one perfect, self-contained step at a 
time.  The construction of real software is messy.

Hm.  You're right on two counts.  The lines:

    undecodable = b'\x7f' * 65 + b'\x85'
and

    decodable = b'\x01\x81'

were not related to the change.  I'm not sure why I decided to make 
those changes.  If I were doing it again now, I wouldn't.

But I'll stick by the decision to write `b'remote'` instead of 
`'remote'` on the line:

    vocab = b'remote'

Impossible. test_jelly imports pb, test_pb imports jelly.

But I can of course reduce the number of tickets related to porting and
put more than one patchfile into them.

That doesn't mean it's impossible.  It just means you may also have to 
shuffle some files around.

Note that my point isn't that we need to reduce the number of tickets 
related to porting or that there should be more than one patch to 
resolve any one ticket (there shouldn't be).

The point is that the documented porting plan is to port module by 
module, not Python 3 incompatible change by Python 3 incompatible 
change.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Client Logic
Message-ID: <786CDC73-43AA-4811-B992-B3817BC5D843@gmail.com>

Folks,

I’m writing an client using twisted, and I’m basing it off the Poetry client from http://krondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/twisted-intro.html.
I am porting a previous pyserial based client, so I’m running into new territory here.

And it’s working fine, there are two “issues" that I am running into.

class WT_Protocol(Protocol):

   tag = ''

   def to_bytes(self, seq):
       """convert a sequence to a bytes type"""
       #
       #   from pyserial.util
       if isinstance(seq, bytes):
           return seq
       elif isinstance(seq, bytearray):
           return bytes(seq)
       elif isinstance(seq, memoryview):
           return seq.tobytes()
       else:
           b = bytearray()
           for item in seq:
               b.append(item)  # this one handles int and str for our emulation and ints for Python 3.x
           return bytes(b)

   def connectionMade(self):
       print "Reseting the network"
       reset = self.to_bytes(packets.network_reset() )
       self.transport.write ( reset )
       self.transport.write ( self.to_bytes(packets.Set_SiteCode(NodeID=255, SC1=0, SC2=0, SC3=0) ))
       self.transport.write ( self.to_bytes(packets.Set_Gain_Packet(NodeID=255, Gain=1) ))    # high gain
       self.transport.write ( self.to_bytes(packets.Set_Protocol_No_Nulls (NetworkID=0, ReceiverID=0, NodeID=1) ))    # high gain
       time.sleep (.5)

Now the client works right now, but I’m concerned that I can’t figure out how to immediately read for a reply packet from the server.

For example, when I send the Set_SiteCode packet, I may receive a reply.  

But how would that occur in the Twisted framework?  In my testing the dataReceived function is not being called, so I can’t trap it there, plus I’m not sure how I would figure that logic.

Can anyone suggest a method to do this?

First, if you want to "immediately" do anything, you really need to delete that "time.sleep(.5)" line from your code.  It will block the whole reactor from getting work done :).

dataReceived will be called with the data when it arrives.  If you're expecting the data that is being sent to be a reply to some message, you should have the code that sends that message return a Deferred; that's what Deferreds are for, representing request/response patterns.

> In my testing the dataReceived function is not being called, so I can’t trap it there, plus I’m not sure how I would figure that logic.

If dataReceived is not getting called, you're not getting data, so no reply has been sent.  You haven't included enough of your program for me to tell why no data is getting sent, though.  Presumably you've got some stuff hooking up your serial port and running the reactor, but without seeing how that works, I can't even guess at what's wrong.

> Can anyone suggest a method to do this?

dataReceived it is :).

Where do you want to press "Q"?  Do you mean you want to pop up a GUI, or wait for the user to type a "Q" in a Terminal window, or do you mean you want the thing on the other end of the serial port to send a "Q"?  Also, what is "UNIX"?

<https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7633> is keeping one of the buildbots persistently red.  It's in review.  There's some discussion on the ticket, 

If anyone has some free time to review it, this would make other code-reviews go just a little bit faster, since reviewers wouldn't need to keep looking at the logs for that builder to make sure that the failures are the "expected" ones; all the builders should be consistently green except for the pesky windows XP one.

Done. Not reviewed for style guide compliance, and I haven't run it locally

Thanks very much for having a look at this!  I'll address the feedback.

You shouldn't need to review for style-guide compliance, as that's the twistedchecker buildbot's job.  Which, I should mention, is green on the branch :).

Also, I already ran the buildbots.  You can quickly investigate their results by looking at the "buildbot" link in the "branch" field of the ticket description.

Armed with these two additional pieces of information, would you be willing to turn this comment into a passing review? ;-)

Thanks again.

If that was intended to be a full review though, you did leave out one important step:

As documented in <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReviewProcess#Howtobeagoodreviewer>,

When you're done with the review, always say what the next step should be: for example, if the author is a committer, can they commit after making a few minor fixes? If your review feedback is more substantial, should they re-submit for another review?

It looks like a "address these minor issues and merge" review, but given that you said you didn't have time to look at certain things, I don't want to make any assumptions.

Message-ID: <20141008192341.17800.2053172312.divmod.xquotient.1235@top>

Hello all,

I'm happy to invite you to a Twisted sprint on Saturday, November 1st
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  ClusterHQ will be hosting up to twenty
(20) Twisted sprinters at the Cambridge Innovation Center ("Coronet
City" room) in Kendall Square from 10AM until 11PM.  The sprint topics
are attendee choice - hacking on any part of Twisted is welcome.  A
large part of the ClusterHQ team will be taking part in the sprint.

ClusterHQ is developing Flocker, a data management tool for use with
Docker written in Python and based on Twisted.  Follow us on Github:

    https://github.com/clusterhq/flocker

ClusterHQ will provide lunch and dinner (something like delivery
pizza, comment on the meetup page if you'd like to suggest
something!).

Find details and chat about sprint topics at the Boston Twisted Python
meetup page:

    http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Twisted-Python/

Early birds, feel free to contact me off-list about meeting up for 
coffee at
around 9AM before the sprint starts.

Space at CIC is limited.  Please RSVP on the Meetup page!

See you there,
Jean-Paul

Apologies.  I got sidetracked preparing for PyTexas (which was last

Message-ID: <B7B4598E-7098-48EC-A1F2-7907E67C52AE@twistedmatrix.com>

On November 1, ClusterHQ is going to be hosting a Twisted sprint in Boston.

One of the things that tends to put a damper on such events is the perpetual backlog of tickets in review, many of which have been there seemingly forever.

I would like to propose that we - the whole Twisted community, but especially Twisted committers - give these sprinters a morale boost, by giving them a clean slate, review-queue wise.  This will let them focus on developing cool new stuff, getting a release out, fixing gnarly old bugs, or whatever strikes their fancy, instead of just grinding through reviews the whole time, or feeling bad about leaving those reviews outstanding.

Right now, we have 58 tickets in review.

<https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/report/25>

Here's my proposal:

I am looking for at least 4 volunteers for a "review rally" starting on Monday, October 13.  If each of 5 reviewers (the 4 volunteers, plus myself) can review 2 tickets per day for one week, until Sunday, October 19, we can clear 70 tickets, which should take care of the existing 58 tickets currently queued up, plus any that get resubmitted during that week.

While some volunteers should be Twisted committers since we have plenty of pending contributions from non-committers that need review, there are at least 11 tickets in review from core contributors right now, so non-committer volunteers are equally appreciated!

Of course, if we get 9 volunteers, then each reviewer only has to do one ticket per day, an even more tractable goal.  And so on into the higher numbers :-).

Who is with me?!?!

-glyph

P.S.: While you should of course do this out of its self-evident merit, I do plan to recognize participation in some way, at least with a commemorative page on twistedmatrix.com, and possibly also with something a little goofy like a Mozilla Open Badge :-).

Thanks HawkOwl!  I'm looking forward to it.  Congrats on being the fastest volunteer :-).

You should be doing reviews anyway (shouldn't we all?) and part of my hope for this is that if we make a periodic concerted push to get the numbers down from the dizzying heights they've jumped to, it will be a lot more satisfying to do reviews more informally later, because there won't be such a discouragingly long list that it's hard to make a dent in.

Thanks Chris, your participation is much appreciated!

Now we've got:

1. me
2. hawkowl
3. chris wolfe

Have you done reviews before?  Before the week starts you should definitely familiarize yourself with <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReviewProcess> and make sure you know what to do.  Please feel free to reach out if this documentation is in any way unclear (we definitely know it's not the best).

1. It's been a while since I helped out.

2. I'm free that week.

3. I could use the karma.



That is all to say, I can help out.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] client logic
Message-ID: <EADCB268-13A7-46D9-9B0C-D1441B7E5F9D@schollnick.net>

I’m sorry if this is a duplicate?  I sent this earlier, but I don’t see it in the archives?

Folks,

I’m writing an client using twisted, and I’m basing it off the Poetry client from http://krondo.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/twisted-intro.html.
I am porting a previous pyserial based client, so I’m running into new territory here.

And it’s working fine, there are two “issues" that I am running into.

class WT_Protocol(Protocol):

   tag = ''

   def to_bytes(self, seq):
       """convert a sequence to a bytes type"""
       #
       #   from pyserial.util
       if isinstance(seq, bytes):
           return seq
       elif isinstance(seq, bytearray):
           return bytes(seq)
       elif isinstance(seq, memoryview):
           return seq.tobytes()
       else:
           b = bytearray()
           for item in seq:
               b.append(item)  # this one handles int and str for our emulation and ints for Python 3.x
           return bytes(b)

   def connectionMade(self):
       print "Reseting the network"
       reset = self.to_bytes(packets.network_reset() )
       self.transport.write ( reset )
       self.transport.write ( self.to_bytes(packets.Set_SiteCode(NodeID=255, SC1=0, SC2=0, SC3=0) ))
       self.transport.write ( self.to_bytes(packets.Set_Gain_Packet(NodeID=255, Gain=1) ))    # high gain
       self.transport.write ( self.to_bytes(packets.Set_Protocol_No_Nulls (NetworkID=0, ReceiverID=0, NodeID=1) ))    # high gain
       time.sleep (.5)

Now the client works right now, but I’m concerned that I can’t figure out how to immediately read for a reply packet from the server.

For example, when I send the Set_SiteCode packet, I may receive a reply.  

But how would that occur in the Twisted framework?  In my testing the dataReceived function is not being called, so I can’t trap it there, plus I’m not sure how I would figure that logic.

Can anyone suggest a method to do this?

The second question, as far as I can tell, isn’t very solvable.  I’d like to add a “Press Q to quit” type logic to the code.  But I don’t see a way to do this easily in twisted?  (platform unspecific, but it’s running Mac OS X / Unix right now).

I'd been planning on getting into doing more reviews, and this is as
good an excuse as any to get started. Monday I'll be travelling, but
I'll try to participate for the rest of the week.

Interesting.  Sorry about that.

I need to confirm this, but I believe I see what is happening now.  Glyph’s reply was quite helpful, I’ll look into the defers.

Thanks for the help.

Every little bit helps - and you can always review 4 tickets on Tuesday to catch up ;-).

Thanks a lot for volunteering!

This is awesome.  Thanks again to everyone for volunteering.  I am looking forward to a big leap forward in contributor responsiveness next week :-D.

But it would be even more awesome if you added your name to this list!

Subject: [Twisted-Python] INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: twisted.python.threadpool -
	time to test!
Message-ID: <C94F4AC7-BB7A-4D3C-9830-0FADD7092ACC@twistedmatrix.com>

Again as per <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CompatibilityPolicy#ProcedureforExceptionstothisPolicy>, in order to conclude this discussion, I need to provide Twisted users with a branch to test their code against.  Well, now you have it - and as per the policy you have a week from the sending of this message to register any objections :).

The ticket <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2673> is in review now, and the branch is <desynchronize-2673-2>.

Many of the existing tests used some of the compatibility features that we discussed previously, so I just left the existing tests intact.  However, if you need any more compatibility features, please let me know and I can implement them in the branch.  Feel free to reply here, or comment there.

I just tested my threadpool statistics collection code against that branch, and it works perfectly! Thanks a lot for your effort in this branch.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] spread: differences between remote_ and
	perspective_ needing an explanation
Message-ID: <27709999.CuWcHncEeD@i5>

Hi,

while trying to isolate a bug in my app, I found some strange
differences between the implementations of remote_* and perspective_*.

1. in pb.Broker.serialize(), those attributes are set and restored:
   jellyMethod, jellyArgs, jellyKw. Within twisted
   Those attributes are not used anywhere. I grepped, and I ran the
   test suite without those. Is there some code outside of twisted
   using this? What for? Or is there a need for avoiding garbage
   collection? (which would need some explanation).

   My theory is that it was forgotten to remove them when doing
   svn commit 1448: Before, they were actually used in 
   _NetJellier._jelly_instance, but no more after this commit.


2. Those implementations differ:
	remote_*: return broker.serialize(state, self.perspective)
   	perspective_*: return broker.serialize(state, self, method, args, kw)
   	view_*: return broker.serialize(state, self.perspective, method, args, kw)
   	observe_*: return broker.serialize(state, None, method, args, kw)

   Can you please explain why remote_* is implemented differently?
   This goes back to before the first import to svn, so I cannot 
   browse the history.


3. They all raise AttributeError for undefined method except remote_*
   which raises MethodNotFound. Both are not documented in the API.
   Could this be unified to MethodNotFound?

   My theory is that svn commit 13473 was incomplete. Commit message was:

	Raise NoSuchMethod instead of AttributeError when call is made to remote_
   	method that doesn't exist

I was unclear, what I want to know is only why args, kw are not passed for remote_*.

I'm curious if any Boston-area Twisted developers or reviewers are going to
be going to the Boston Python User Group Meetup tomorrow [Tuesday] at MS

joining the review rally—and it's always more fun to get started with
others.

Either way, I am interested in reviewing code, if there is a way for a
long-time Twisted user, but list lurker, to get started reviewing code.

I'll see if I can crank through a couple of tickets, but this week is...not
a good week for me.

Of course, Twisted might be a good distraction from work annoyances.

It's unlikely I'll get through more than a handful over the week, but I
figure a handful is better than none.

Although I'm a non-committer, I'll pop-in during the week :)
I wanted to give Adiroiban's cleanup tickets a review anyway.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Serializing cftp and ssh sessions
Message-ID: <86A36C5B-6A8A-4A7C-AF45-8D6D6E324B31@Chaos1.DE>

I have adapted t.c.s.cftp and one of the ssh examples to transfer files to a remote host and than execute some commands there.
Both has to be done for several remote hosts in sequence.
Start of the ssh session has to wait until the cftp sessions are complete and after that has completed, the cftp session for the next host has to be started . . .

The cftp part begins so:

def distributeStuff(host, tasks):
    . . .
    doConnect(reactor, options, tasks)


def doConnect(reactor, options, tasks):
    . . .
    conn.tasks = tasks
    vhk = verifyHostKey
    uao = SSHUserAuthClient(options['user'], options, conn)
    connect(host, port, options, vhk, uao).addErrback(_ebExit)

class SSHConn(connection.SSHConnection):
    def serviceStarted(self):
        self.openChannel(SSHSession())

I played with inlineCallbacks but could not find a point where to place my yielded function.
I tried to overwrite channelClosed in SSHConn:

    def channelClosed(self, channel):
        super(SSHConn, self).channelClosed(channel)
        if len(self.channels) == 0:
            print ‚[Last channel closed.]'
            # open ssh ssession:
            . . .
 but that gave an unhandled error:
2014-10-14 07:54:34+0200 [SSHService ssh-connection on SSHClientTransport,client] Unhandled Error

Message-ID: <CACL3mTA9wxFoSwy0DYPB-29A_+3ycfz0X7Q3FmzKPh03zkuZcw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
   I don't know if here is the right place.
I hit a problem with pyapns which is based on twisted.

So, I get code from our parter and setup up env involving interacting with
APNS for IOS pushing work.

I hit the problem that twisted hangs after a while's idle, I mean, when I
start twisted with command:
twistd -r epoll web --class=pyapns.server.APNSServer --port=7077

Then, raise an notification to IOS device by pyapns(
https://github.com/samuraisam/pyapns),it's OK.

However, if I let the system alone for a while, then, new raised
notifications are all failed, what's more, if now I kill twisted process,
and restart with the above command again, push operations are successful
again.

I use python2.7 and twisted 14.0.0 on Redhat6.4.

So, anyone has hit this problem?

Thanks.
Wesley

Hey  Ni

I can not relate to your specific problem. But where I work, we have a
pyapns server in place for push notifications. What we have learned is
that the v50 branch of the repo is much more stable than the code in
master. So maybe give v50 a try, notice that a new rest api is used in
v50.

To run it, you need to prepare some files in /tmp and select a host to which you have ssh access via public key.
If you comment out the call to ssh.executeRemoteCommands in test, sftp.distributeFiles should complete successfully if you run test.
Commenting out the call to sftp.distributeFiles, allows the call to ssh.executeRemoteCommands to do its work, but it does not exit.

pyapns uses threads very heavily, and so my guess would be most likely that you're calling a Twisted API from a non-main thread.  Without seeing the code it's impossible to say.

There's some Twisted-based apache2-licensed APNS integration code available here: <https://trac.calendarserver.org/browser/CalendarServer/trunk/calendarserver/push/applepush.py>.  Unfortunately it is a little bound up with internal implementation details of calendar server, but it's almost generic and it might be worth the effort to extract, since it will almost certainly give you more robust behavior than integrating pyapns and Twisted.

I honestly have no idea.  If you think this is buggy and you'd like to change it, please feel free to propose a change which does so, as long as it's within the bounds of <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CompatibilityPolicy>.

Simply changing this is not OK, because code may be relying upon the existing behavior and we can't just break it.  Again, see <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CompatibilityPolicy>.

That said, we could expose a new public name (something other than Broker, for example) which fixes these bugs, then deprecate the existing name.

Hi,
   The code is from our partner, so currently I won't change their code
until I address this issue.
The used pyapns code is here:  https://github.com/samuraisam/pyapns
And start twisted service by command :  twistd -r epoll web
--class=pyapns.server.APNSServer --port=7077

And start twisted service by command :  twistd -r epoll web
--class=pyapns.server.APNSServer --port=7077

And here is function of our code to do push action:
def __send_push(push_app_id, org_apns_cert, device_apns_token, payload):
    """
    This method will send the actual push to the device, it will first try
to send assuming we already have
    provisioned this org cert, if it fails if will provision, this way we
don't create too many connections
    """
    pyapns.configure({'HOST': MDM_PYAPNS_HOST})
    try:
        pyapns.notify(push_app_id, device_apns_token, payload)
    except UnknownAppID as e:
        # this is an expected exception where connection to this cert is
killed or we are sending this push
        # for the first time, in this case we need to provision first and
then try notify again
        current_app.logger.info(u"Couldn't find app_id for this push, retry
")
        try:
            pyapns.provision(push_app_id, org_apns_cert, 'production')
            pyapns.notify(push_app_id, device_apns_token, payload)
        except Exception as exc:
            current_app.logger.exception(exc)
    except Exception as exc:
        current_app.logger.exception(exc)

Could you please help have a look?

Thanks.
Wesley

OK, you made me curious ;).

I looked through the code, and as it stands, I doubt my original hypothesis (a threading problem) is correct.  Threads are used only in the client talking to the pyapns server, not the pyapns server's client talking to APNS, so they're probably not interfering with it.

As far as I can tell, the ReconnectingClientFactory is set up properly.  Have you looked at the logs?  The one possibility I can think of just from examining the code is that the log messages before calling up to ReconnectingClientFactory.clientConnectionLost are raising an exception, causing the reconnection not to proceed.  That would most likely show a traceback in the logs, though.

<https://github.com/samuraisam/pyapns/blob/master/pyapns/server.py#L157-L164 <https://github.com/samuraisam/pyapns/blob/master/pyapns/server.py#L157-L164>>

Any clue?

I got the point.
server.py:
def write(self, notifications):
    "Connect to the APNS service and send notifications"
    if True: #not self.factory:
      log.msg('APNSService write (connecting)')
      with open('/tmp/wniapns.log','a') as f:
          f.write("#"*20+"\n")
          f.write("apns server1\n")
          f.write("#"*20+"\n")
      server, port = ((APNS_SERVER_SANDBOX_HOSTNAME
                      if self.environment == 'sandbox'
                      else APNS_SERVER_HOSTNAME), APNS_SERVER_PORT)
      self.factory = self.clientProtocolFactory()
      context = self.getContextFactory()
      reactor.connectSSL(server, port, self.factory, context)

    client = self.factory.clientProtocol
   * if client:*
      with open('/tmp/wniapns.log','a') as f:
          f.write("#"*20+"\n")
          f.write("apns server2\n")
          f.write("#"*20+"\n")
      return client.sendMessage(notifications)
    else:
Problem is for twice push to one device, client is not None the second
time, code goes here and error then.

BTW, what I wanna ask is where is the default log file? I didn't see any
exception raised.

I haven't used pyapns and twisted before, I see twisted has lines like
log.msg("xx"), where is the default log file?

Thanks.
Wesley

This is a fairly strong showing - the queue is down to 44 now, down from 58 when this was announced, which is a significant dent - but it does look like we have a little catching up to do!  I would particularly like to nudge Paul and Jonathan to throw their respective hats into the ring, since it looks like we don't have any reviews from them in the official rally period just yet :-).  Sorry if I missed something because this may not be the most reliable data source!

Thanks everyone,

Don't worry, I know I need to do reviews. Have just been running into
intermittent test failures and a local dev environment snafu.

Is there a secret method to get trac to accept a new ticket? I can't get the spam recognition percentage below 85% for my bug report, which looks very much unlike any spam I've ever seen.

Great, glad you could figure it out.

With the command line you mentioned previously, it should be in a file called "twistd.log".

Well, I haven't done as many as I would have liked to have done, but I've
done some.

I hope this helps. May your sprint be of great success.

I can't tell if this represents a bug in Twisted or not.  After a quick 
look through the code, I'm not really clear on why the program would 
ever exit (I didn't find the calls to `reactor.stop`, I guess they're 
hidden somewhere in conch "library" code), nor quite which code paths 
you expect to work and which you expect to fail.


What is the expected behavior if I run test.py after editing it to point 
at a host I have access to?

Is that the desired behavior?

If there is a second case, what one edit can I make to observe that 
behavior?  How does the behavior differ from what you're trying to 
achieve?

Separately:

  * You should rewrite this code to not use twisted.conch.client.connect. 
That's some random library code no one ever expected application code to 
use.  It's public, so you can use it if you want, but that's no promise 
it's any good.

  * Use twisted.conch.endpoints.SSHCommandClientEndpoint to perform 
`exec` requests

  * Consider pitching in to complete 
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/6617 so you can use the new 
`SSHSubsystemClientEndpoint` API that ticket introduces to set up your 
SFTP connections.

Hi,

I'm trying to run the following program :

from twisted.enterprise import adbapi

dbpool = adbapi.ConnectionPool("MySQLdb", "khalid_sultaln", "root", "mysql")

def xmlValues() :
    return dbpool.runQuery("SELECt * from xml_vaules limit 1")

def printResult(l):
    print type(l)
    print l[0][0]



xmlValues().addCallback(printResult)


But its not printing anything. What exactly i'm doing wrong?

Hi,

You haven’t started the reactor, so nothing has “started”. It’s just sitting there, waiting for it to be “spun off”.

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/_downloads/echoclient_ssl.py

Try using react, as detailed in this example — you should put your code in a similar main() block.

I must prevent this stopping of the reactor, because I’m unable to start it again.
I’m always getting twisted.internet.error.ReactorNotRestartable after trying it while reactor.running is False.

If you put a reactor.stop() at the end of ssh._ebExit, test.py should run to completion after doing the remote file operations and executing the remote commands.
>

No.
I need a solution where the call to executeRemoteCommands() is delayed until all remote file operations are complete. Similar the next call to distributeFiles (with a different host) must wait until the previous call to executeRemoteCommands has no outstanding operations.

No.

See above. I must synchronize operations at 2 points in a loop.
I tried to do this with callbacks, called at connection shutdown.
What do you think about this?

I looked at endpoints before, but failed to implement public key authentication and a callback when complete.

Thanks for looking into this,

Okay.  I guess I misunderstood part of the problem statement.  I thought

That sounds like the correct solution to me.  The simplest way to 
structure your code is to make the APIs for starting these two 
operations return a Deferred that fires when the operation is complete. 
Then you can use these Deferreds to construct the desired control flow 
for starting the operations.

You should be able to do key-based authentication with the endpoint. 
SSHCommandClientEndpoint.newConnection accepts a `keys` argument if you 
want to specify the keys to use explicitly.  It also accepts an 
`agentEndpoint` argument if you instead want to point it at an SSH key 
agent which will perform key operations for it.

I have implemented this in a prototype, which does what I want, simply by calling the next top level operation when one has completed.
Your suggestion would require to handle the Deferred down to the point of connection termination.

Thanks for your support,

Anaconda is a python distribution with many modules already installed. The whole distro installs to a separate root folder named 'anaconda'. How do i install twisted to this?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Announcing Eliot 0.5.0: Structured Logging as
	Storytelling
Message-ID: <2e29454d10d1a02cf4f7e55d38703713@itamarst.org>

 

Eliot provides a structured logging and tracing system for Python that
generates log messages describing a forest of nested actions. Actions
start and eventually finish, successfully or not. Log messages thus tell
a story: what happened and what caused it. 

Eliot has first class support for Twisted, including integration with
Trial. 

Eliot is released by ClusterHQ [2], the Data People for Docker(tm), and
is available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/eliot [3]. Documentation is
available at https://eliot.readthedocs.org [4]. 

Here's what your logs might look like before using Eliot: 

Going to validate http://example.com/index.html [1].
Started download attempted.
Download succeeded!
Missing <title> element in "/html/body".
Bad HTML entity in "/html/body/p[2]".
2 validation errors found!

After switching to Eliot you'll get a tree of messages with both message
contents and causal relationships encoded in a structured format: 

	* {"action_type": "validate_page", "action_status": "started", "url":
"http://example.com/index.html [1]"} 

 	* {"action_type": "download", "action_status": "started"}
 	* {"action_type": "download", "action_status": "succeeded"}

	* {"action_type": "validate_html", "action_status": "started"} 

 	* {"message_type": "validation_error", "error_type": "missing_title",
"xpath": "/html/head"}
 	* {"message_type": "validation_error", "error_type": "bad_entity",
"xpath": "/html/body/p[2]"}

 	* {"action_type": "validate_html", "action_status": "failed",
"exception": "validator.ValidationFailed"}

 	* {"action_type": "validate_page", "action_status": "failed",
"exception": "validator.ValidationFailed"}

What's New in 0.5.0: 

 	* Added support for Python 3.4.
 	* Most public methods and functions now have underscore-based
equivalents to the camel case versions, e.g. eliot.write_traceback and
eliot.writeTraceback, for use in PEP 8 styled programs. Twisted-facing
APIs and pyunit assertions do not provide these additional APIs, as
camel-case is the native idiom.
 	* eliot.to_file outputs log messages to a file.
 	* Documented how to load Eliot logging into ElasticSearch via
Logstash.
 	* Documentation has been significantly reorganized.

Anaconda is a python distro. It comes in many flavors depending on the desired interpreter (2.7, 3.4, etc) how does one select and install the correct version of twisted?
