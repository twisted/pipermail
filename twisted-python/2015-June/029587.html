<PRE>Some repilies to all the issues mentioned here:

1. I think we should definitely maintain our own copy. Sorry for it not
being a fork, the only non-formatting changes I made are things that
referrred to the Django-run events (since we don't run events -- I did
replace some of this language with mention of the meetup group). As for
CC-BY: I did refer to the Django CoC, I thought CC-BY only refers to the
&quot;last point of copying&quot;. If it makes sense to add Speak Up! to the mention
for license compliance, I'm happy to do that.

2. The Django CoC specifically has a change procedure. I did not copy that
part over, since our organization is a lot less formal -- I'm pretty sure
it's &quot;if the PLC agrees&quot;. I think it's a problem that we don't have the
names of the people on the PLC on our wiki, but this is a separate issue.
[It should be rectified, as well as clarifying the rules for how the PLC
acquires/retires members.

3. I considered briefly the PSF one. I think it is *way* under-specified. I
want to have something that's clear. I think Django, specifically, has a
pretty good track record of promoting diversity and the PSF has a...worse
one.

4. A CoC has several purposes, and &quot;banning people&quot; is actually pretty far
down the list. The first reason is that we assume most people are good
people, or at least wish to follow the rules, and having clear rules about
what's not acceptable will hopefully lead to people voluntarily complying.
The second reason is to send out a message to underrepresented groups: &quot;we
value you, and will protect your right to be treated with dignity in our
community&quot;. While this does not solve diversity problems by itself, it is
an important step. A distant third, in my opinion, is the banning of people
-- not least because this issue has not really come up [some people got
banned from IRC, I believe, but usually not for the kind of reasons
described in the CoC, and I don't remember people getting banned from Trac
or the ML]. I really did mean what I said in my first e-mail: we do try to
be an open and inclusive place. We are *already* complying with the CoC.
[If you subscribe to a Hyackean view of law and legislation, this is law,
not legislation.]

5. Not a reply to an e-mail, but I like to publicly call out Hyneck for
actually reading through the CoC, noticing a couple of mistakes and sending
me a pull-request. It is much appreciated!

Thanks everyone who took the time to read and think about this important
issue,
Moshe Z.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks for taking this on, Moshe.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; +1

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My current draft, including instructions on how to build it, is in
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/moshez/twisted-coc">https://github.com/moshez/twisted-coc</A> . I have intentionally not made the
</I>&gt;<i> built documents available, in an attempt to avoid someone picking them up
</I>&gt;<i> before they're approved by us.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Why isn't this repository either (A) just a simple text file saying
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;we have adopted the Django CoC&quot; or (B) a very small fork of something
</I>&gt;<i> else?  One of the concerns is licensing; if the text comes via Django,
</I>&gt;<i> Django credits the &quot;Speak Up!&quot; project, which is CC-BY, apparently from
</I>&gt;<i> this repository: &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/jnoller/talk-mentorship">https://github.com/jnoller/talk-mentorship</A>&gt;.  Another
</I>&gt;<i> is... is Twisted really distinct enough to need its own CoC?  Just
</I>&gt;<i> s/Django/Twisted might be good enough?  (Since this is not a fork, figuring
</I>&gt;<i> out if anything else has changed is rather tedious, even after having read
</I>&gt;<i> both ;)).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I wonder whether it might make sense to just say we adopt
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/">https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/</A> ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; What I would really love is if we could have our own diversity
</I>&gt;<i> statement like Django has: <A HREF="https://www.djangoproject.com/diversity/">https://www.djangoproject.com/diversity/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The Django one is more explicit -- it's rather sad that it needs to be,
</I>&gt;<i> but it does lay out more directly the unacceptable behaviours.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That being said, it's not an unchangeable document -- if it doesn't suit
</I>&gt;<i> the community's needs, we can modify it to suit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So that CoCs are just a set of rules to ban users expressed in a vague
</I>&gt;<i> legal form, so that people can not complain, because they don't
</I>&gt;<i> understand. Is that right? =)
