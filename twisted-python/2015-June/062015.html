</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As mentioned in <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-">http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-</A> python/2015-March/029258.html , Twisted is removing Python 2.6 support. As such, I would like to announce that 15.3 will be the last release with 2.6 support. After this release, the Python 2.6 buildbots will be removed from the 'supported' list and most likely retired.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This will remove all buildbot coverage of OS X and RHEL/CentOS. As I've been taking point on the buildbots recently, I'm going to be deploying a new CentOS 7 buildslave which will provide coverage of that platform. That just leaves OS X uncovered -- so if you would like to donate buildslaves for this, please send me an email.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think this is backwards.  There was basically no strong argument made against dropping Python 2.6 support but there was no case made for dropping OS X support.  I don't think you can remove the only OS X builder from the supported list.  That's equivalent to saying OS X support is being dropped.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So either the existing OS X slaves need to be upgraded first (I don't see why you wouldn't just do this) or Python 2.6 support (at least on OS X) needs to be retained until someone else volunteers a Python 2.7 OS X slave.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi JP,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I know that this would leave OS X uncovered -- lukasa, habnabit, and Adi have at separate points offered OS X builders of varying OS levels and even Python versions, both on the mailing list and in #twisted-dev (where Lukasa answered the call from this email and offered a Yosemite builder today), which is why I am confident that this will not end up being an issue when 15.3's first prerelease is issued.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be even more confident if you don't disable the Python 2.6 OS X builder until a new Python 2.7 OS X builder is set up.  If this turns out to be easy, then nothing has been lost.  If it ends up being hard, then it's much better than having a screwed up 15.3.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the prevailing reason that we don't have an OS X 2.7 bot is that last time OS X hardware was offered, the buildbot was not being actively maintained. I've taken up the mantle in some capacity and getting Twisted supported on more platforms is my primary goal. And as an OS X user, I have some vested interest in it continuing being supported.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Once again, I'm not really clear on why the existing build slaves aren't just being upgraded.  Why is new hardware required?
</I>
This prompted me to see if the existing builder could be upgraded.  I thought the hardware was unsupported, but I hadn't checked.  I think I was wrong, and it is now downloading Yosemite.  (For the third time.  Trying to do this download on the first day of WWDC may not have been the greatest idea.)

I think that new hardware would still be preferable because this machine is old, slow, overtaxed, and unreliable.  For example, it runs Speed Center as well as the OS X builder.  We have redundancy in most of our other builders now, which is very useful especially during times of heavy activity, like sprints, where lots of concurrent builds are going on, but this is the sole OS X builder.

Another area where redundancy would be nice is when doing upgrades.  For example, if the download ever finishes, I'm going to pull the trigger on this Yosemite upgrade, and ... hopefully it works?  If it doesn't, we will have zero Mac builders until someone in the data center that is donating hosting can plug a console into that machine and see why it didn't finish booting.  There's not really a good way to manage this right now.

Finally, it would be nice to actually support multiple pythons on multiple OS versions - all the still supported / updated ones, anyway - and we'd need multiple builders for that.
