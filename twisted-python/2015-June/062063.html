<PRE>I definitely meant &quot;I don't think that should block adoption&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that you meant
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I *don't* think that should block adoptionâ€¦
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> unless you meant you thought it should block adoption of the PSF CoC?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, to try to cover some concerns raised so far:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why the Django CoC rather than the PSF (or, the quite-similar Contributor
</I>&gt;<i> Covenant)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are two reasons: specificity, and reporting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Specificity is important because of course, everyone wants to be
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable.  The point of having a code of conduct is outlining what
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;reasonable&quot; means in our specific context.  Given the difficulties the
</I>&gt;<i> software industry has had in the last couple of decades with respecting its
</I>&gt;<i> marginalized members, it's important to take that context into account and
</I>&gt;<i> say what (sadly) might not be obvious to people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Clarity around how reporting violations works is important because people
</I>&gt;<i> who are already feeling harassed in their day-to-day existence are often
</I>&gt;<i> not going to be comfortable poking around trying to figure out *how* to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with a violation of the code on their own.  Most likely, they will
</I>&gt;<i> simply quietly exit the community.  So it should be as easy as possible to
</I>&gt;<i> report.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why isn't this a fork of an existing CoC?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that this is a problem.  Django does not appear to have their CoC
</I>&gt;<i> in an easily-forkable format.  Perhaps we should contact the Django project
</I>&gt;<i> and ask them to rectify that so that we can make minor tweaks.  We also do
</I>&gt;<i> need minor tweaks, because the information about contact points for
</I>&gt;<i> reporting has to be different for different projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd also like to raise two issues of my own.  In his original message,
</I>&gt;<i> Moshe said this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think, and hope, that our IRC channel, our issue system and mailing list have
</I>&gt;<i> been a friendly, pleasant place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the most part, I believe this is true, and I think we have managed to
</I>&gt;<i> be a welcoming and pleasant environment for all concerned.  However, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't want anyone to get a false sense of confidence from this, and think
</I>&gt;<i> that we're doing great since we've never had any incidents.  The nature of
</I>&gt;<i> such incidents is to remain private.  In Twisted's decade-plus of history,
</I>&gt;<i> especially on IRC, I have had to personally adjudicate several disputes,
</I>&gt;<i> and we have definitely had potential contributors quietly disappear from
</I>&gt;<i> the community due to apparent hostility or inappropriate remarks.  We have
</I>&gt;<i> certainly had to ban people from the channel, on at least one occasion
</I>&gt;<i> permanently.  There have not been any particularly severe, particularly
</I>&gt;<i> public or particularly recent incidents, but there has definitely been some
</I>&gt;<i> unpleasantness at times. So, while I do believe we are doing well, there is
</I>&gt;<i> unquestionably room to improve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you all so *very* much for not making me type that as a *reply* to
</I>&gt;<i> anyone saying we don't need a CoC ;-).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I would like to stress that I personally believe that this is a
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0-release type of effort, and in no way a finished product.  I have lots
</I>&gt;<i> of concerns with fairness and transparency in the way disputes are handled,
</I>&gt;<i> and the list of possible responses, but what we have right now (i.e.: the
</I>&gt;<i> personal judgement of whatever committer happens to be online at the time)
</I>&gt;<i> is definitely far worse.  So I expect that the work will continue and we
</I>&gt;<i> will see revisions to this, hopefully in collaboration with other projects
</I>&gt;<i> so that Twisted developers aren't taking this on, Django being the obvious
</I>&gt;<i> example.
