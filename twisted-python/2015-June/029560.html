<PRE>Glyph and I have been discussing the state of &quot;unsupported&quot; buildbots for the Twisted project, and some of the cleanup of unsupported platforms that I've been doing. To get the reasons for this, and an idea of the future out, Glyph suggested I post to the mailing list.

In the past, a lot of the unsupported buildbots were platforms that we knew didn't work. A lot of these have been tested for many months, kept in the unsupported list, and not had much progress. We need to focus on the unsupported builders that have a path to being supported, and get them onto the supported list.

I've now removed broken, absent, or superseded builders, giving us five unsupported builders. These are:

- FreeBSD 10.1, Python 3.4 -- Tests almost pass, waiting on <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7887">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7887</A> to make it all-green. Once it is green, it can move to supported.
- OS X 10.6, Python 2.6, cfreactor -- There are only a few failing tests -- soon, there'll be a OS X 10.10 cfreactor builder (once we get XCode installed on it :) )
- Python 3K Warnings -- Two failures, which are warnings counting -- should be trivial.
- Ubuntu Trusty, Python 2.7, wxreactor -- broken, needs fixing
- Ubuntu Trusty, PyPy 2.4. -- 32 failing tests <A HREF="http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/trusty64-pypy-2.4/builds/132/steps/trial/logs/problems">http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/trusty64-pypy-2.4/builds/132/steps/trial/logs/problems</A> . Some are pypy, some are configuration related.

These builders should ideally move into the 'supported' list in the future. To do this, we need to:

- Get <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7887">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7887</A> reviewed to get the FreeBSD 10.1 + Python 3.4 builder as a supported platform
- Fix <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7931">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7931</A> to make the Python 3K Warnings builder pass
- Get a new OS X 10.10 cfreactor builder, to see what failures there are on Python 2.7
- Redeploy the wxreactor builder, see what failures there are. I'm planning to do this on a newly deployed Ubuntu 15.04 machine when I get time.
- File more tickets in <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query?group=status&amp;milestone=PyPy-support">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query?group=status&amp;milestone=PyPy-support</A> for the failures on the PyPy builder and fix them. I'm planning on also doing a PyPy 2.6 builder using the aforementioned Ubuntu 15.04 buildbot, using the PPA, which should shake out the new dict-sorting bugs.

If you would like to see these builders become supported in the future, please do consider helping out! :)
