<PRE>Not that I'm a heavy contributor, but:

   - A CoC is like a ToS in many ways.  They rarely get read until there's
   a problem.
   - A CoC is like a License in many ways.  They should be pretty standard
   infrastructure.

I think both of these facts argue for joining Twisted to an existing CoC.
No one goes around reading the CoC for every group they participate in. We
increase the odds that someone reads our CoC if they get leverage (one
read, lots of groups) and we get spill-over (they read the CoC for another
group and thus know ours).

If an extremely common library (think JSON handler) lacks a feature, we
don't start by creating yet another fork.  We make the case to fix
upstream. We only consider forking if we can't get upstream fixed. A CoC is
no different. In fact, a CoC is likely even more generic than a JSON
library -- I have to wonder what's so special about a CoC that we'd need a
fork!  If we use the upstream CoC, we also benefit from improvements
contributed by others.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure everyone understands that the Twisted community would love more
</I>&gt;<i> diversity. While it is hard to achieve, it should be easy to remove one of
</I>&gt;<i> the obvious blockers -- making underrepresented groups feel more welcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think, and hope, that our IRC channel, our issue system and mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> have been a friendly, pleasant place. This is an attempt to clarify what we
</I>&gt;<i> mean by a &quot;friendly, pleasant place&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After some discussion on IRC, I volunteered to write up a Code of Conduct
</I>&gt;<i> for Twisted. It is mostly an adaptation of Django's CoC -- I think Django
</I>&gt;<i> has a nice track record of commitment to diversity, and, of course, we
</I>&gt;<i> expect our communities to overlap.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My current draft, including instructions on how to build it, is in
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/moshez/twisted-coc">https://github.com/moshez/twisted-coc</A> . I have intentionally not made the
</I>&gt;<i> built documents available, in an attempt to avoid someone picking them up
</I>&gt;<i> before they're approved by us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please respond if there are any concerns about the wording, anything that I
</I>&gt;<i> missed and anything you think does not belong there. I hope we can achieve
</I>&gt;<i> consensus, and have the Project Leadership Committee approve this
</I>&gt;<i> (including approving the current committee -- I've volunteered to chair it,
</I>&gt;<i> and Glyph and Amber (HawkOwl) have graciously agreed to be on it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Moshe Z.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've noticed several typos in the Reporting Guidelines section
</I>&gt;<i> (reporting.rst)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this is the appropriate place to report them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * first sentence of the 4th paragraph of the &quot;What Happens...&quot; section.
</I>&gt;<i>   The last word is &quot;response&quot;, should be &quot;respond&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Last sentence of the same paragraph: &quot;Finally, the Working Group will
</I>&gt;<i> make a report on the situation to the DSF board. The board may choose to
</I>&gt;<i> a public report of the incident.&quot;  Should be TSF board, not DSF board, and
</I>&gt;<i> needs a verb in the final clause, probably &quot;make&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, more substantively, the first possible response is &quot;Nothing (if we
</I>&gt;<i> determine no violation occurred).&quot;  Maybe I'm just too literal, but I
</I>&gt;<i> think there should be a positive response to every report, even if that
</I>&gt;<i> response is &quot;We've decided not to do anything&quot;, so the reporter knows the
</I>&gt;<i> report has been seen and thought about and hasn't just fallen through the
</I>&gt;<i> cracks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another note, someone earlier implied that since Twisted doesn't sponsor
</I>&gt;<i> events, the event-related parts of the Django CoC were irrelevant.  In
</I>&gt;<i> the past, there have been several local bug-fixing sprints, one of which
</I>&gt;<i> I almost actually attended.  I would think these would qualify as events
</I>&gt;<i> and the issues for a CoC when people meet in person may be somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> different from when we meet online.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, I strongly support this and am happy the Twisted Project is
</I>&gt;<i> taking a proactive stance on it.  Great work, everyone, and thank you
</I>&gt;<i> Moshe, Glyph and Amber!
