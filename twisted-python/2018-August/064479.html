</I>&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm Alex from SeedAndDew. I was chatting with Moshe about SeedAndDew and whether Twisted would like to participate and he mentioned bringing it to the mailing list to get your opinions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> SeedAndDew is a common subscription platform that allows users to contribute to a number of open source projects with a single subscription. The idea here is that it's a lot easier to get people to contribute $10/month to every open source  project they work with than it is to get them to contribute $5/month for a specific project. The subscription revenue will be distributed based on the amount of time users spend reading documentation of the respective project which I anticipate will correspond well with actual use. So if a user spends 10% of their time reading the Twisted documentation, you get 10% of the subscription revenue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our goal is to increase the pool of people who contribute to open source by removing the friction of having to manage subscriptions paid to specific projects and changing it as your stack and interests change. This would be a passive income source that doesn't require any further work outside of the initial integration.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So far we have 10 projects including SQL Alchemy, RSpec, Bundler, Browsh and Parse. Does this seem like something you would be interested in?
</I>
We'd definitely be interested in this, but you probably want to contact the Software Freedom Conservancy - <A HREF="https://sfconservancy.org/about/contact/">https://sfconservancy.org/about/contact/</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://sfconservancy.org/about/contact/">https://sfconservancy.org/about/contact/</A>&gt; - to work out the details of how this might work financially.

Thanks for reaching out!
