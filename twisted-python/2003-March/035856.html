We do tend to NIH here, but there are usually good reasons.  Here are a  
few why rewriting would be a good idea in this case:

1. I can't accept GPL'd software into Twisted if the author isn't  
willing to contribute it.  Perhaps this means we need some kind of  
'contrib' section?

2. That particular project's implementation was completely terrible; I  
may be wrong about this, because I haven't evaluated it thoroughly, but  
it's pretty well tied to threading and blocking.

3. Twisted is going to need to rely on service discovery for a lot of  
stuff, eventually.  I _want_ a version of this rewritten from scratch  
with Twisted idioms in mind.  (I also wouldn't want something this  
potentially important to the core to be off in a seldom-maintained  
'contrib' module.)
