</I>
I thought this was what pb.SetUnjellableForClass() was for...  Inspecting
pb.py leads to flavors.py, where I see that setCopierForClass is actually a
reference to setUnjellyableForClass.  So I'm already doing this -- note that
I'm not getting class not allowed exceptions, but module not allowed.

Moreover following the logic through to it's culmination in
jelly.SecurityOptions.allowTypes(), I still can't see how this could affect
which modules are allowed.

It looks like I need to call jelly.globalSecurity.allowInstancesOf()
directly.  Probably in a similar manner to how jelly.SetUnjellyableForClass()
calls globalSecuirty.allowTypes().  Actually, this looks like a bug:
shouldn't SetUnjellyableForClass() call allowInstancesOf() rather than
allowTypes()?

&gt;<i> As far the inheritance, you should only to inherit from RemoteCopy for
</I>&gt;<i> client side objects, not both pb.Copyable and pb.RemoteCopy...
</I>
The objects can go both ways, and so it is easiest to set them all to inherit
from both.  This is what's suggested by the documention, so i figured it
shouldn't hurt anything.

&gt;<i> The &quot;setCopyableState&quot; idiom for constructing remote classes may seem
</I>&gt;<i> onerous at first, but its use really is necessary. Distributed objects _are_
</I>&gt;<i> different from regular local objects and the requirements for managing them

</I>&gt;<i> model - it is far more secure and resistant to hackery than using Pickle.
</I>&gt;<i> Pickle's internal use of Python's eval function makes it very scary to
</I>&gt;<i> unserialized Pickled objects on a server...
</I>
I do like the security, and many aspects of the architecture are quite nice!

Looking more closely at jelly.py I see that I probably don't need to worry
about setCopyableState(), as it seems to do it's business without relying
upon __init__, and thus __init__ can still be used traditionally.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In short I don't see how the example code on:
