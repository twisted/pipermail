Oh, I'm not one to take critique too personally... if I don't
&quot;get it&quot;, I don't get it.  ;)

</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> Indeed!  There is virtually no need to mention threads in defer.html at all.
</I>
Ok. I'll re-write to pull threads out.  I was just trying
to re-write the code so that it was runnable.  In particular,
I was looking for a trivial example of something which would
be defered.   Perhaps a small example using reactor.callLater
would be a better choice.

|<i> &gt; Anyway, I think having one (runnable) example that doesn't even depend
</I>|<i> &gt; on asynchrony might even be a good thing. Something like:
</I>|<i> &gt; 
</I>|<i> &gt;   d = Deferred()
</I>|<i> &gt;   d.addCallbacks(...)
</I>|<i> &gt;   d.callback(x)
</I>|<i> &gt;   # maybe another d.addCallbacks(), etc
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> Yes, that's a good idea.  It's worth emphasising that there's really no
</I>|<i> voodoo here.  Possibly even demonstrate it in an interactive session, so
</I>|<i> that it is really clear that nothing happens until it is called.
</I>
Yes, good idea.

|<i> &gt; The point would be to show that indeed Deferreds don't have anything
</I>|<i> &gt; special to do with asynchrony (or especially threads), as well make it
</I>|<i> &gt; more clear what Deferreds are really doing, by showing it in the
</I>|<i> &gt; simplest manner possible.
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> Which reminds me: the title should probably be &quot;Deferred Results&quot;.  I think
</I>|<i> perhaps this is what confuses people; Deferreds aren't about delaying
</I>|<i> execution arbitrarily, or doing work in threads, or hooking into the event
</I>|<i> loop, they're about handling results that haven't arrived yet.  A Deferred
</I>|<i> doesn't represent a *callback*, it represents a *result*, and it provides
</I>|<i> simple (and powerful) ways to register callbacks to operate on the result,
</I>|<i> whenever it becomes available.
</I>
Great explanation.

|<i> &gt; So yeah, I think we should have a few good runnable examples in the
</I>|<i> &gt; document, including one like I mentioned, as well as some &quot;case-study&quot;
</I>|<i> &gt; things like threading, refID-mapping (This was mentioned in another
</I>|<i> &gt; recent thread), etc.
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> Case studies would be worthwhile.  I don't really like the idea of padding
</I>|<i> out the document many more with more examples, because it's already a long
</I>|<i> read.  But adding a section to the end called Case Studies would allow
</I>|<i> plenty of room to add complete, verbose examples, without detracting from
</I>|<i> the exposition of the core concepts.
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> So in my opinion, the code samples should be left pretty much as they were
</I>|<i> -- minimal, clear examples of the general principles, not necessarily
</I>|<i> ready-to-run, and then add case studies to the end.  I'm even tempted to say
</I>|<i> this is a pattern that more of the docs should follow.... :)
</I>
I think the CaseStudies should kinda be distinct, in the
&quot;Examples&quot; directory or something like that.   However,
the 'deferred' could give an index of how the concept
was used in various examples.

I don't have time to further patch today/tomorow, but I'll
fix it by Wed.
