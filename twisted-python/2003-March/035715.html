<PRE>As one who has perpetual newbie-mind, I feel I should comment ...

On Sat, 2003-03-08 at 20:49, Andrew Bennetts wrote:
&gt;<i> You've sacrificed clarity for runnability.

Having read it carefully, I have to agree with Andrew here.  

&gt;<i> I'm not sure that's the right
</I>&gt;<i> thing to do; the point of this example is now obscured behind details like
</I>&gt;<i> how threading.Timer works, and spelling out a dummy &quot;nonBlockingOperation&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> method where before it was quite clear without it.  
</I>
These were criticisms I had, too.

&gt;<i> Not all example code
</I>&gt;<i> in the Howtos must be immediately executable standalone... I think perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> this example code would be better in the doc/examples directory, where it is
</I>&gt;<i> more appropriate for examples to be verbose like this.
</I>
Here I disagree.  Newbies are generally served better by 
examples with lots of (germane) comments ... but not 
extraneous stuff, like the Timer.  And I think it would be 
&quot;nice&quot; if they were executable, but if it comes down to 
choosing between clarity and executability, clarity should win.  

&gt;<i> Also, the way the example used to be reflected an idiomatic use in Twisted:
</I>&gt;<i> where there is some event handler, e.g. onResult, fired at an arbitrary time
</I>&gt;<i> by some external source.  Think of e.g. Protocol objects with dataReceived.
</I>&gt;<i> The example as it was emphasised that Deferreds can apply equally well when
</I>&gt;<i> you don't have control over when some event completes -- regardless of
</I>&gt;<i> whether it came from a thread, or the network, or anywhere.
</I>
Which is almost always the case, of course.

&gt;<i> &gt; -&lt;p&gt;There are several things missing in this simple example.  There is no way to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -know if the data never comes back; no mechanism for handling errors.  There is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -no way to distinguish between different calls to gotData from different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -sessions.  &lt;code&gt;Deferred&lt;/code&gt; solves these problems, by creating a single,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -unified way to defer execution of code that depends on blocking calls.&lt;/p&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +&lt;p&gt;There are several things missing in this simple example.  There is no way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +to know if the data never comes back; no mechanism for handling errors.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; +example does not handle a multiple callback functions, nor does it give a

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What does &quot;merge arguments before and after execution&quot; mean to a Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> newbie?  Why would they want to do it?
</I>
Here I disagree again.  I think I know what is meant (although 
clarity could be improved, again), and it was one of the first things 
I wanted to do ... of course, it didn't take too long to suss that 
lambdas are the preferred idiom for that ... 

&gt;<i> ....  I think I'd also like
</I>&gt;<i> to add back the comment about &quot;This is an asynchronous equivalent of ...&quot; --
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps it's overly jargonistic, but it is the way I think about Deferreds;
</I>&gt;<i> they are the primary tool Twisted provides to abstract away blocking
</I>&gt;<i> operations into a fundamentally asynchronous framework.
</I>
Total agreement.  If they don't know what &quot;asynchronous&quot; 
means, they can look it up!  Sheesh, it's a standard term.  
(Twisted-specific jargon is not a problem in the docs 
either, as it is always defined when introduced.)

&gt;<i> Again, with the next two examples I think you've obscured the point in your
</I>&gt;<i> efforts to make everything explicit.  I'd rather have a 10 line example
</I>&gt;<i> that illustrates a concept, than a 20 line example that obscures the same
</I>&gt;<i> concept behind irrelevant method definitions, etc.  ...
</I>
Agreed also.  

That said, I think there are cases where the in-line examples seem
a trifle too elliptical.  I'll have to be more specific, I know, 
so I'll send an example when I have time.  

- Steve.
