Oh, there's no doubt that having this around as example code would be 
wonderful!  Doing a rapid prototype to experiment would also be good, 
although I think it may end up being easier for someone like exarkun to 
put together a prototype using the existing DNS code we have in 
twisted.names rather than actually copying this project.

I don't know enough about either to be sure, though.
