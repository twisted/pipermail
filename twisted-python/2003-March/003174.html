<PRE>While I'm musing... I have a few thoughts on Producer/Consumer as well;
but I don't yet have any experience with the Twisted constructs yet...
so I could be speaking incorrectly.

Before I get going, I wanted to point out that there is some overlap
with this producer/consumer mechanism and the Deferred mechnaism.  In
particular, the callback chain processing in _runCallbacks seems very
much like a sequence of steps in an operation.  And, the Deferred
package also has a mechanism to merge two or more deferreds into a
single deferred, etc.  These things are very much in the spirit of a
event 'reactor' processing.  This observation is especially true when
you allow the Deferred operation to 'return multiple times', aka one
callback per row.

That said, I expected a Producer/Consumer chain to have something like
the following:
  
   class Producer:
      def cancel(self): pass           # permanently stop processing
      def pause(self): pass            # stop producing events
      def resume(self): pass           # resume after being paused
      
   class Consumer(self):
      def start(self): pass            # called before events start
      def handle(self,data): pass      # called for each event
      def finish(self): pass           # called after events are done

   class Processor(Producer,Consumer): pass

   Further, it could be possible that a consumers and producers have
   a many-to-one relationship, in which case, all of the Producer
   functions would take a consumer argument and all of the Consumer
   functions would take a producer argument.

The IConsumer interface seems close, I guess start/handle/finish is the
same as registerProducer/write/unregisterProducer.  Besides not liking
the names, I'm not sure if it is semantically the same as what I was
thinking.  The registerProducer call seems to hint at a
many-producer-to-one-consumer call model, where a consumer can be the
target of many producers.  However, I don't see a corresponding producer
argument in the 'write' or 'unregisterProducer'... so that can't be it.
Lastly, I think that 'write' is too specific, in a database case you
want to hand rows to the consumer, not strings (as implied by the
'write' name).

I grok the IProducer interface much better, in fact it has almost the
same arguments that I expected.  As for the 'streaming' flag, if it is
set, it seems that the producer will generate one event and then
automatically pause.  So, I'd rename streaming to &quot;autopause&quot; or
&quot;pauseonwrite&quot; as this better reflects the semantics -- right now, after
just reading the code, I'm not sure if 'streaming' means that it pauses
automatically after each write or not.  Further, the choice if a
producer is started initially or stopped initally seems one that should
be made higher-up; tying it to 'streaming' or 'unstreaming' doesn't
really make sense.  Finally, the producer interface should probably have
two attributes, 'autopause' and 'isPaused' or something equivalent; the
registerProducer function doesn't need the streaming flag.

Exception handling doesn't seem to be spelled out at all in this chain,
perhaps it need not be.  I don't know, but it seems that some sort of
error propigation would be very useful so that the offending 'initial'
data can be found when something down-stream goes bezerk.  So, someway
to collect a stack trace up the producer/consumer chain would be quite
useful.  This could be done with one function on the Producer:
getErrorContext(), which returns a string

Another useful thing for this model to do is allow a 'tag' to be passed
as an argument to each of the start/handle/finish functions.  This,
together with allowing nested start/finish calls would allow
hierarchical streams to be handled.  In this model, the 'start' call
could provide a subordinate consumer to handle events for a particular
child subtree.   This mechanism is very handy for common
content-producing patterns.

Lastly, the linkage back to the Deferred could be done by a
DeferredProcess, where each item added to a DeferredProcess is one of a
Producer (the first item in the stack), a Process (middle items), and a
Consumer (final item).
