Typically one would call rollback() before you put 
the connection back into the connection pool.  Overall,
I think there is a lower level design problem with
the adbapi module.  If you are only running one query
then there isn't a rpoblem, but if you are executing
3 queries, say sequentially, then you don't want
that rollback.  The adbapi needs to expose 'connection'
object as a whole, with cursors.   I'll need to fix
this for myself... so if no one else does, I'll patch.

For now, I think rolling back between each query is
good enough... if someone wants to run several queries
in a row, then they really should help me patch.

The other related item is that some databases allow
for multiple cursors with the same connection; and
thus a single request may want to run N deferreds in
parallel (I do, for example) and these deferreds should
all come from the same connection if at all possible.

In short, this is one small issue that needs to be
resolved in that module.

Best,

Clark
