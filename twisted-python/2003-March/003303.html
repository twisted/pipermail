Don't mind Tv's troll. Admittedly it was a litte amusing to see a
buzzword-filled post, but nothing any of us would really get annoyed
with. :-)

&gt;<i> The solution needn't be buzzword compliant. I just want to know the twisted

</I>
I think what most needs to be defined here is the interactions that
are required between the different services. What hosts/ports the
clients connect to the services with are pretty much irrelevant (i.e.,
facade). Once you have the interactions figured out, you can just use
PB to have the different services talk to each other (if they need to
be on separate hosts), as well as for the clients to talk to the
services.

Also, the plugin/component stuff is mostly fluff. Plugins are only
useful when you want 3rd parties to add functionality to your service
through some application-specific API, and I gather that's not going
to be a requirement for you.

Just know that it's probably simpler than you think. A few python
servers that use PB to talk to each other. :)

&gt;<i> In a couple of articles on Python and Twisted, Aaron Trauring has made the
</I>&gt;<i> point that multiple Twisted services (web, im, email, etc.)  can all run in
</I>&gt;<i> a single process.  Is the single process approach desirable over a multiple
</I>&gt;<i> component approach?  Or is that only desirable when your needs are small and
</I>&gt;<i> your application is unlikely to become CPU bound?
</I>
If you need to be able to put the services on separate hosts, then
yeah, you'll need to use separate processes and use PB to talk between
them. If you don't, however, it's much easier and simpler to just let
the services live in the same process and have synchronous access to
all the objects in the system.
