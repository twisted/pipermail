<PRE>Matthias,

Since I wrote this, I've been informed of two relevant posts:
twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2002-September/001685.html
twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2003-February/002808.html.

Both of these are doing the same sort of thing, only that they
are using a 'pull' mechanism rather than a 'push' technique.  Anyway,
at first I was thinking that the 'pull' approach is better and that
the stuff I wrote may not be useful; but upon further rework, I 
now think that both approaches are somewhat complementary, and 
perhaps they could both be supported.

Also, the current version in the Sandbox has a few problems
as far as usage.  I'm not sure how to fix them, but another
refactor is needed.   Specifically, I'm using addFilter about
80% of the time and the mechansim needs to put addFlush in 
its public interface (I needed it about 3 times when I was
re-working some of my application code... )

Best,

Clark
