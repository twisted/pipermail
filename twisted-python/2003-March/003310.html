Just a brief word of warning... while I've had a few good experiences 
integrating C/C++ code with Python, SWIG has uniformly been horrible.  
This particular issue is not with SWIG, but it may create interference 
later on.

The reason that you're having this problem is that on the C++ side of 
things, FD 0,1,2 are just normal FDs.  This is due to the fact that we 
trap the sys.stdout _object_ in python, but we don't keep the 
file-descriptors around.  The Transport of your Protocol is getting 
created after those FDs have been closed, and is therefore haplessly 
allocating the FD of stdout by chance.

I don't know how to create a file-descriptor in C which translates to 
function calls on a Python file-type object.  In fact, I don't even 
know if that's possible.  However, this is clearly incorrect behavior 
for cout&lt;&lt; and printf.  Can anyone with more experience in this area 
propose a solution?
