  Since no one else has jumped in yet, I'll tell you what I know (not a
lot).  As it stands now, Twisted.sister has a problem with authorizers. 
Some stuff it depends on got changed around, and no one brought Sister up to
date.  I posted a patch that fixes it to the list a while back, but it
seemed like a bad hack around a more basic problem.  No one responded, so I
never checked it in (I can make it available if you want and can't find it
in the archives).

  This is just one symptom of the real problem, I think: Twisted.sister has
no real users right now.  Twisted practices XP development most of the time,
which means the code that no one really has a use case for can sometimes get
into pretty bad shape.

  I might be overstating the problems with Sister - as I said, I don't know
too much about it - but in any case, I think many of the other features
Twisted offers *do* make it suited for your goal.  With a real user with
real use cases, Sister would definitely see improvement (You'd yell at us
when it broke, or if you're more proactive than that, you'd give us unit
tests for it ;).

  So what's my point?  Ahh, Twisted is good for this, but Sister might not
be ready for what you need it to do, because no one has asked Sister to do
*anything* before.  Give it a nudge in the right direction and it will
probably turn into what you need, or if it doesn't, doing what you need
&quot;from scratch&quot; (on top of Twisted) shouldn't be much more effort.

  Hope this helps,
