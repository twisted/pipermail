<PRE>A little history about the sister code...

I (along with Glyph) was the original developer of this code for a game
project. At one stage, it was fully integrated with authorizers and
enterprise and I had distributed logins working, spawning of &quot;game servers&quot;
on multiple machines in a cluster, object loading from a database, and
centralized locking of resources across the distributed system.  I had a set
of twisted servers running my game world across three different machines on
different operating systems almost transparently to the application code.

Unfortunately, I am no longer at that company on that project and no-one is
using or really maintaining the sister code. Jp is right in saying that it
needs users - it really also needs developers. It's probably not a huge task
to bring it back up to date, but i admit I haven't looked at the code in
about four or five months and don't have the time or motivation to spend on
it these days, but i would be willing to answer any questions if that is
useful.

Also, it's original purpose was actually more to distribute a single type of
application rather than to connect a set of different applications as the
origin poster suggests.

  Since no one else has jumped in yet, I'll tell you what I know (not a
lot).  As it stands now, Twisted.sister has a problem with authorizers.
Some stuff it depends on got changed around, and no one brought Sister up to
date.  I posted a patch that fixes it to the list a while back, but it
seemed like a bad hack around a more basic problem.  No one responded, so I
never checked it in (I can make it available if you want and can't find it
in the archives).

  This is just one symptom of the real problem, I think: Twisted.sister has
no real users right now.  Twisted practices XP development most of the time,
which means the code that no one really has a use case for can sometimes get
into pretty bad shape.

  I might be overstating the problems with Sister - as I said, I don't know
too much about it - but in any case, I think many of the other features
Twisted offers *do* make it suited for your goal.  With a real user with
real use cases, Sister would definitely see improvement (You'd yell at us
when it broke, or if you're more proactive than that, you'd give us unit
tests for it ;).

  So what's my point?  Ahh, Twisted is good for this, but Sister might not
be ready for what you need it to do, because no one has asked Sister to do
*anything* before.  Give it a nudge in the right direction and it will
probably turn into what you need, or if it doesn't, doing what you need
&quot;from scratch&quot; (on top of Twisted) shouldn't be much more effort.

  Hope this helps,

  Jp
