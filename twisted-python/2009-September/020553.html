This fails the &#8220;self-contained&#8221; criterion, by the way, as it assumes access to a
host called &#8220;romeo&#8221;.

[It also fairly clear isn't *completely* minimal either, e.g. I'm pretty sure
the addCallback(runall) is not required to see your problem.  I also suspect
that you only need one connection to demonstrate this bug, but because it's not
self-contained it's hard to tell how far from minimal it actually is.]

Anyhow, my guess (it has to be a guess, as your example isn't self-contained, so
I cannot run it to examine the problem for myself), is that the problem is that:

 a) you create one Deferred per connection (self.deferred in MyClientFactory),
    combined with...
 b) your lineReceived invokes gotData which often calls that deferred without
    any robust defence against calling that deferred multiple times.

e.g.  consider a server that sends &quot;221 2.0.0 Bye&quot; followed by a blank line.
The specific data triggering your problem should be obvious from the output of
your &#8220;print repr(data)&#8221; line in gotData.

-Andrew.
