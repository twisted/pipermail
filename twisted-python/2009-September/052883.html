Agreed, but for whatever reason, this is the first time I've heard it  
come up on the list since I ran into it, which may be why it hasn't  
been added to the install docs. I'm sure a docs patch would be well  
received, if you were so inclined ;-)

Well, to be honest, it could easily break iCal Server; I'm not really  
sure. I only use regular iCal, which is unaffected by this change.

That said, I've had a lot of luck running old applications against  
brand new checkouts of Twisted. It's obviously going to depend on what  
parts of it are used, and which parts are in active development, but  
historically I haven't had too many problems.

Also, I was under the impression that only OS X Server came with the  
iCal Server, so on second thought, I'm not sure why the twisted source  
is even there in the client install. Of course, at this point I'm  
operating entirely on heresay and conjecture, since I never took the  
time to look for iCal Server in the client installation of OS X.
