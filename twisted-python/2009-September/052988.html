You have to solve it by only calling reactor.run once.
&gt;<i>

</I>
You have to use a protocol which lets you distinguish between different 
files.  I'm not sure what &quot;TS&quot; is so I can't make any specific 
suggestions.

Another possibility is to keep using multiple connections.  You can call 
reactor.connectTCP as many times as you want.  It's only reactor.run 
that can only be called once.
