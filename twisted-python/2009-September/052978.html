reactor.running is really only provided for backwards compatibility.  It 
was never intended to be public.  It has bizarre semantics which you can 
read about in its unit tests:

What you would almost certainly rather do is change your code not to 
rely on it.  Why do you find yourself needing to ask the reactor if you 
have previously asked it to stop?  Generally, your code should be able 
to keep track of that itself.
