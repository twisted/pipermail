There's no way to know when &quot;all remaining Deferreds have fired&quot;.  Since 
Deferreds are general purpose and any part of Twisted may internally use 
them for anything they're suited for, this isn't really what you want 
anyway.  You want to know when all of *your* tasks have completed.  So, 
you should look at all the APIs you have which return Deferreds, decide 
which APIs need to be allowed to complete (perhaps it will be all of 
them) before shutdown can happen, and then instrument those APIs to keep 
track of their own status.  This may be as simple as internally adding a 
callback to the Deferreds being returned (before returning them), 
letting you know when each task has completed.  This should let you 
decide when things are quiet enough to shut down.
