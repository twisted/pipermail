Hi Kyle!

I decided to give the cibuildwheel package a try and it made this process almost too easy (well... sort of :] ).  I've got AppVeyor-Windows, Travis-Linux, and Circle-OSX all building a variety of wheels for the supported Python versions and bit depths.  Travis doesn't save artifacts 'easily' so I went ahead and doubled up on Linux on Circle for now, though it's having some Docker issues at the moment and hasn't been successful yet.  For some reason in this one case the project directory isn't getting mounted into the container as expected.

Thanks for doing this!

It's not clear to me that we have any test environments that accurately test what happens after you install from PyPI.  If we could build these wheels and then actually run tests on installing them that would be a big step forward in test fidelity!  But given the current state of the art, I'd be happy if they just got built from the same code that passed our tests in existing configurations.

> Overall, it's a bit unclear what the intended use of the various CI hosts are for Twisted.

Ideally, Travis would handle it all.

But Travis can't run multiple kernels, so we have buildbots for lots of alternate kernels, just to make sure.  Including BSD kernels, since those are actually substantially different where sockets are concerned.

And Travis macOS support is so slow that it was a serious blocker for a while, so the buildbot is filling in until Circle can take over.

And Travis can't do Windows, so that's where appveyor comes in.

There might still be various non-special-kernel testing things that buildbot does, but those are probably holdovers that, if they still have a reason to exist, it's exactly because Travis doesn't have artifact hosting.

Hopefully that's comprehensive?

> I hear that Travis OSX builds were really slow, but from what I can see Circle isn't doing any OSX (other than what I added).

The issue for addressing this is https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9445 <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9445> if you'd like to pick up where Adi left off.  It's probably just resolving some conflicts, resubmitting for review, and bugging people to get it through the process :).

> There wasn't any artifact storage being used on Circle either.  So, I'm not sure if there was a reason to use Circle that went away, or...  But, not having to hook Travis up to S3 or somesuch for storage is quite nice so Circle wins at least in that category.

I think the big problem on Circle is capacity limits, but I don't know if that's just a macOS thing, or what.

> Now that I've got something rough in place, are there any opinions about how this should work?  I don't know the present release workflow so I don't know if we'd want an automatic push to PyPI on tags (probably not)

I definitely want this.  This is really the whole point, what we're trying to get to :).  Why don't you think we want this?

> or just artifacts on the build server to grab manually (would need some S3 or such for Travis, or Circle for Linux builds as well).  Anything else?  Do we want automated tests against the wheels?  cibuildwheel does have a feature for that though I haven't done anything with it yet.

Ideally we'd push the wheels on tag once the tests passed, but I'd be OK with just unconditionally just building / pushing on tag for starters.

> Anyways...  hello, thanks for Twisted, and I hope this work ends up saving some people some time.

I can't wait for fully automated releases :).

Why would you do this rather than simply handle logging events? Both twisted and the stdlib have mechanisms for adding observers that will give you access to more structured information - particularly useful if you are trying to display something in a GUI.

This (sort of) makes sense...

So, this is the old, legacy API, and what you want to use is this: https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.logger.LogBeginner.beginLoggingTo.html <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.logger.LogBeginner.beginLoggingTo.html>

But it doesn’t make sense to me that you would see no output at all, or that setStdout=False would swallow your print statements.

The only thing starting logging here appears to be flask-twisted; we only start logging in twist & twistd, within twisted itself.

> Any guidance / ideas?  

I'm very curious what is going on here, and whether it's a logging system bug.  Could you whittle this down to a minimal reproducer?

cibuildwheel does have an option to provide a test command.  If we did 
that would we replace the existing tests or supplement?  If 
supplementing that will presumably be a significant increase in build 
times.  Especially if we did it for all wheels.

So, how much of a build time hit do we want to take?

https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1056/files

It looks like the builds I added in my wheel PR, for whatever that is 
worth.  Well, other than picking xcode v9 vs me picking v10 which 
neither of the PRs use anyways.  I added the requires over in the wheel 
PR as well in case it ends up saving a useful amount of our OS X quota.

Uhm...  hmm...  *shrug*  I figured someone might want to do a final spot 
check or have manual intervention for a real release.  You can't replace 
a file on PyPI so...  but sure, I didn't mean to argue against 
automation.

Here's one spot I did automatic deployment off of Travis to PyPI.

https://github.com/altendky/gitignoreio/blob/aeeb9546b6f27f411b191699d3625b4d0a08e7cf/.travis.yml#L11-L19

Pretty straightforward though I think it does the wheel build which 
isn't what we'd really want.  I'd have to check on how to deploy 
existing wheels as well as those from OS X and Windows.  I'd suggest a 
separate PR?  I mean maybe it'd be easier to get one PR reviewed than 
two but that doesn't seem like a great reason to mash things together.

Cheers,

I was referring to supplementing the existing src tests with the wheel 
tests.

Alrighty, another PR for swapping over tests from src to wheels.

I would tend to always build the wheels.  It's easier for people to test 
intermediate releases for bugs.  It makes a release 'less special' so 
there is less likely to be a latent issue with the process or artifacts. 
  Etc.  But, let's see what the build time hit is.

Travis: 4 minutes, about half the time of a single version test job
AppVeyor: 7 minutes, about the same as a single version test job
Circle OS X: 9 minutes, a bit over a single version test job
Circle Linux: 5 minutes, a bit under a single (OS X) version test job

Ok, so for about the cost of testing a single Python version we can get 
wheels.  Especially if we want to switch over to testing wheels instead 
of source, I'd plan on building wheels for every commit.

Shall the process be build wheel, upload to test PyPI, install from test 
PyPI, test...  :]  But sure, I could see ending up with a test PyPI 
upload at least for a tag/release.  Could technically do it for every 
build but that seems excessive, even given my comments above about 
exercising the process more often rather than less.

Yeah, it's cool but then you have to know what is behind it...  for each 
CI host...  and how to make it use the files you want...  So I'd tend 
towards a twine call.  I made this silly little script the other day to 
handle this in another repo.

Ok, I'll make separate tickets for:

* Testing wheels vs. src
* Automatic deployment to PyPI

That's a little more blam than this little script really needs, though I

Yeah. Also noted when I saw it. Again, seemed to be more effort than I
wanted, though if someone were to say "well, that's what you're stuck with
if you use that legacy stuff" I'd be off to do the thing.

The sad part is that when I went to put together  the minimal reproducer,
the problem went away.

There is something in my code somewhere that is causing this. I have no
idea what it is, yet, but when I put together a minimal web server that
uses twisted.reactor.callLater() to periodically start a background task,
Twisted is not grabbing stdout or even pushing its own logging to sdtout.

I think it might be how I set up the original project in my IDE - for the
sample project, I started with a clean directory and clean project file
(PyCharm if it matters). So I'm gonna pursue that further.  I think that it
might be the IDE's environment if you tell it "this is a Flask project". I
was seeing weird things from the minimal example as well until I cleared
out all the IDE meta files and reinitiated it as a "pure Python" (in
PyCharm terms) project.

Thanks for your time and thanks for the push that got me moving (hopefully)
in the right direction. :)

 Regards,

Jeff

For the curious, it looks like the culprit is Flask's logging features.
I'm not entirely sure what all is happening, but it's clear from docs and
code (and a lot of unresolved Stack Overflow threads) that it's hijacking
stdout in a way that is confusing to many.  Looks like the best approach is
to not let it use its defaults for logging (which I was doing initially
until I decided to be "clever") - explicitly configure logging so that you
can control its behavior explicitly as well.

Its internal logging uses the python native logging, so once I get that
squared away I can focus on wrangling the Twisted logger as well.

Regards,

Jeff

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Switch Protocols mid Connection
Message-ID: <2a688000-2233-c60d-ae9b-e88faa08573a@tnr.cc>

I'm new to Twisted and really enjoying the event driven approach, 
especially with the availability of in-line callbacks to avoid callback 
hell.  So thanks to all of you who have worked on Twisted.

The program I'm writing uses AMP for peer to peer communication. I like 
AMP because it's natively asynchronous, has multi-language support, and 
efficient, not wasting resources on HTTP headers, etc.  There are times 
when I need to send files, 1-2 MB over the connection.  AMP provides a 
binary type, but it's limited to 64k, so I'd have to split the files up 
and make 16+ calls to transfer a single file.  So I need to switch to a 
more appropriate (not yet determined) protocol for the transfer, and 
then back to AMP.  AMP provides a protocol switch command, which is 
great, but then I'd need to switch back to AMP and I have no idea what 
approach to take here.  It  doesn't help that I don't have a file 
transfer protocol selected.

Speaking of file transfer protocol , Twisted's FTP seems like overkill 
for my simple scenario, though if I could harness the functionality I 
need, I'd use it.  I've also read up on Twisted's Producer/Consumer 
approach, which I'm thinking if I have to roll my own, this is the path 
I should take.  However, I surely can't be the first person in more than 
a decade to want to transfer a file while speaking AMP.

So, how do I switch back from a file transfer protocol to AMP and what 
existing protocol, if any, should I use for the transfer?

Thanks so much.

-Randall

Your code is mostly correct, but you are running the default Twisted reactor.  You need to use the asyncio reactor.  The article Kyle linked to (https://meejah.ca/blog/python3-twisted-and-asyncio <https://meejah.ca/blog/python3-twisted-and-asyncio>) describes the necessary set-up.  Hopefully in the future this will be more automatic!

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

I'm very pleased to announce txtorcon 18.1.0. This adds or fixes the
following:

 * better error-reporting (include REASON and REMOTE_REASON if
   available) when circuit-builds fail (thanks David Stainton)
 * more-robust detection of "do we have Python3" (thanks Balint
   Reczey)
 * fix parsing of Unix-sockets for SOCKS
 * better handling of concurrent Web agent requests before SOCKS ports
   are known
 * allow fowarding to ip:port pairs for Onion services when using the
   "list of 2-tuples" method of specifying the remote vs local
   connections.

You can download the release from PyPI or GitHub (or of
course "pip install txtorcon"):

   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txtorcon/18.1.0
   https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon/releases/tag/v18.1.0

Message-ID: <2cb01d85-3ca4-9c9b-9366-0eebb1e58a0c@atleastfornow.net>

Hello everyone! It's time again for a Twisted release. It's not a huge 
one, but it does have some important changes!

Twisted 18.9rc1 features:

- Support for Python 3.7!
- Better support for Unicode handling in logging tracebacks in Python 2
- trial -j now reports tracebacks on test failures on Python 3.
- twisted.internet._sslverify.ClientTLSOptions no longer raises 
IDNAError when given an IPv6 address as a hostname in a HTTPS URL.
- HTTP/2 server connections will no longer time out active downloads 
that take too long.

You can get the tarball and the NEWS file at 
https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/rc/18.9.0rc1/ , or you can try it out 
from PyPI:

     python -m pip install Twisted==18.9.0rc1

Please test it, and let me know how your applications fare, good or bad! 
If nothing comes up, I will release next week.

- Amber

The NEWS file displays with no line breaks on Win10 in either Firefox or 
Chrome.  This makes it essentially unreadable.  Going back to 
https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/rc/, and looking at the various 
release candidates, it looks like 17.1.0rc1 and before look like normal 
text files, but 17.5.0rc1 and later look like a single globbed line of 
text.  Probably not coincidentally, the good versions all list the 
Content type as [text/plain] whereas the unreadable versions are all 
[text/html]

Going back to https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/rc/, and looking at the various release candidates, it looks like 17.1.0rc1 and before look like normal text files, but 17.5.0rc1 and later look like a single globbed line of text.  Probably not coincidentally, the good versions all list the Content type as [text/plain] whereas the unreadable versions are all [text/html]

This is actually a bug in Twisted itself, if you are keen to fix it :)

Previous versions have 'NEWS.txt', and Twisted knows about the MIME type for '.txt' files, probably via /etc/mime.types or similar.  Current versions have 'NEWS.rst', and twisted has a default MIME type of text/html (which is a terrible idea and should not be the case).

You might be able to fix this by eliminating the default MIME type from Twisted (although this would just let your browser do the sniffing, not sure if that would be better) or you could definitely fix this by teaching Braid <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid>> about text/x-rst <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html#what-s-the-official-mime-type-for-restructuredtext-data <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html#what-s-the-official-mime-type-for-restructuredtext-data>>.

Hi Kyle!

I decided to give the cibuildwheel package a try and it made this process almost too easy (well... sort of :] ).  I've got AppVeyor-Windows, Travis-Linux, and Circle-OSX all building a variety of wheels for the supported Python versions and bit depths.  Travis doesn't save artifacts 'easily' so I went ahead and doubled up on Linux on Circle for now, though it's having some Docker issues at the moment and hasn't been successful yet.  For some reason in this one case the project directory isn't getting mounted into the container as expected.

Thanks for doing this!

It's not clear to me that we have any test environments that accurately test what happens after you install from PyPI.  If we could build these wheels and then actually run tests on installing them that would be a big step forward in test fidelity!  But given the current state of the art, I'd be happy if they just got built from the same code that passed our tests in existing configurations.

> Overall, it's a bit unclear what the intended use of the various CI hosts are for Twisted.

Ideally, Travis would handle it all.

But Travis can't run multiple kernels, so we have buildbots for lots of alternate kernels, just to make sure.  Including BSD kernels, since those are actually substantially different where sockets are concerned.

And Travis macOS support is so slow that it was a serious blocker for a while, so the buildbot is filling in until Circle can take over.

And Travis can't do Windows, so that's where appveyor comes in.

There might still be various non-special-kernel testing things that buildbot does, but those are probably holdovers that, if they still have a reason to exist, it's exactly because Travis doesn't have artifact hosting.

Hopefully that's comprehensive?

> I hear that Travis OSX builds were really slow, but from what I can see Circle isn't doing any OSX (other than what I added).

The issue for addressing this is https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9445 <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9445> if you'd like to pick up where Adi left off.  It's probably just resolving some conflicts, resubmitting for review, and bugging people to get it through the process :).

> There wasn't any artifact storage being used on Circle either.  So, I'm not sure if there was a reason to use Circle that went away, or...  But, not having to hook Travis up to S3 or somesuch for storage is quite nice so Circle wins at least in that category.

I think the big problem on Circle is capacity limits, but I don't know if that's just a macOS thing, or what.

> Now that I've got something rough in place, are there any opinions about how this should work?  I don't know the present release workflow so I don't know if we'd want an automatic push to PyPI on tags (probably not)

I definitely want this.  This is really the whole point, what we're trying to get to :).  Why don't you think we want this?

> or just artifacts on the build server to grab manually (would need some S3 or such for Travis, or Circle for Linux builds as well).  Anything else?  Do we want automated tests against the wheels?  cibuildwheel does have a feature for that though I haven't done anything with it yet.

Ideally we'd push the wheels on tag once the tests passed, but I'd be OK with just unconditionally just building / pushing on tag for starters.

> Anyways...  hello, thanks for Twisted, and I hope this work ends up saving some people some time.

I can't wait for fully automated releases :).

Why would you do this rather than simply handle logging events? Both twisted and the stdlib have mechanisms for adding observers that will give you access to more structured information - particularly useful if you are trying to display something in a GUI.

This (sort of) makes sense...

So, this is the old, legacy API, and what you want to use is this: https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.logger.LogBeginner.beginLoggingTo.html <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.logger.LogBeginner.beginLoggingTo.html>

But it doesn’t make sense to me that you would see no output at all, or that setStdout=False would swallow your print statements.

The only thing starting logging here appears to be flask-twisted; we only start logging in twist & twistd, within twisted itself.

> Any guidance / ideas?  

I'm very curious what is going on here, and whether it's a logging system bug.  Could you whittle this down to a minimal reproducer?

cibuildwheel does have an option to provide a test command.  If we did 
that would we replace the existing tests or supplement?  If 
supplementing that will presumably be a significant increase in build 
times.  Especially if we did it for all wheels.

So, how much of a build time hit do we want to take?

https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1056/files

It looks like the builds I added in my wheel PR, for whatever that is 
worth.  Well, other than picking xcode v9 vs me picking v10 which 
neither of the PRs use anyways.  I added the requires over in the wheel 
PR as well in case it ends up saving a useful amount of our OS X quota.

Uhm...  hmm...  *shrug*  I figured someone might want to do a final spot 
check or have manual intervention for a real release.  You can't replace 
a file on PyPI so...  but sure, I didn't mean to argue against 
automation.

Here's one spot I did automatic deployment off of Travis to PyPI.

https://github.com/altendky/gitignoreio/blob/aeeb9546b6f27f411b191699d3625b4d0a08e7cf/.travis.yml#L11-L19

Pretty straightforward though I think it does the wheel build which 
isn't what we'd really want.  I'd have to check on how to deploy 
existing wheels as well as those from OS X and Windows.  I'd suggest a 
separate PR?  I mean maybe it'd be easier to get one PR reviewed than 
two but that doesn't seem like a great reason to mash things together.

Cheers,

I was referring to supplementing the existing src tests with the wheel 
tests.

Alrighty, another PR for swapping over tests from src to wheels.

I would tend to always build the wheels.  It's easier for people to test 
intermediate releases for bugs.  It makes a release 'less special' so 
there is less likely to be a latent issue with the process or artifacts. 
  Etc.  But, let's see what the build time hit is.

Travis: 4 minutes, about half the time of a single version test job
AppVeyor: 7 minutes, about the same as a single version test job
Circle OS X: 9 minutes, a bit over a single version test job
Circle Linux: 5 minutes, a bit under a single (OS X) version test job

Ok, so for about the cost of testing a single Python version we can get 
wheels.  Especially if we want to switch over to testing wheels instead 
of source, I'd plan on building wheels for every commit.

Shall the process be build wheel, upload to test PyPI, install from test 
PyPI, test...  :]  But sure, I could see ending up with a test PyPI 
upload at least for a tag/release.  Could technically do it for every 
build but that seems excessive, even given my comments above about 
exercising the process more often rather than less.

Yeah, it's cool but then you have to know what is behind it...  for each 
CI host...  and how to make it use the files you want...  So I'd tend 
towards a twine call.  I made this silly little script the other day to 
handle this in another repo.

Ok, I'll make separate tickets for:

* Testing wheels vs. src

That's a little more blam than this little script really needs, though I
appreciate the suggestion.

Yeah. Also noted when I saw it. Again, seemed to be more effort than I
wanted, though if someone were to say "well, that's what you're stuck with
if you use that legacy stuff" I'd be off to do the thing.

The sad part is that when I went to put together  the minimal reproducer,
the problem went away.

There is something in my code somewhere that is causing this. I have no
idea what it is, yet, but when I put together a minimal web server that
uses twisted.reactor.callLater() to periodically start a background task,
Twisted is not grabbing stdout or even pushing its own logging to sdtout.

I think it might be how I set up the original project in my IDE - for the
sample project, I started with a clean directory and clean project file
(PyCharm if it matters). So I'm gonna pursue that further.  I think that it
might be the IDE's environment if you tell it "this is a Flask project". I
was seeing weird things from the minimal example as well until I cleared
out all the IDE meta files and reinitiated it as a "pure Python" (in
PyCharm terms) project.

Thanks for your time and thanks for the push that got me moving (hopefully)
in the right direction. :)

 Regards,

Jeff

For the curious, it looks like the culprit is Flask's logging features.
I'm not entirely sure what all is happening, but it's clear from docs and
code (and a lot of unresolved Stack Overflow threads) that it's hijacking
stdout in a way that is confusing to many.  Looks like the best approach is
to not let it use its defaults for logging (which I was doing initially
until I decided to be "clever") - explicitly configure logging so that you
can control its behavior explicitly as well.

Its internal logging uses the python native logging, so once I get that
squared away I can focus on wrangling the Twisted logger as well.

Regards,

Jeff

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Switch Protocols mid Connection
Message-ID: <2a688000-2233-c60d-ae9b-e88faa08573a@tnr.cc>

I'm new to Twisted and really enjoying the event driven approach, 
especially with the availability of in-line callbacks to avoid callback 
hell.  So thanks to all of you who have worked on Twisted.

The program I'm writing uses AMP for peer to peer communication. I like 
AMP because it's natively asynchronous, has multi-language support, and 
efficient, not wasting resources on HTTP headers, etc.  There are times 
when I need to send files, 1-2 MB over the connection.  AMP provides a 
binary type, but it's limited to 64k, so I'd have to split the files up 
and make 16+ calls to transfer a single file.  So I need to switch to a 
more appropriate (not yet determined) protocol for the transfer, and 
then back to AMP.  AMP provides a protocol switch command, which is 
great, but then I'd need to switch back to AMP and I have no idea what 
approach to take here.  It  doesn't help that I don't have a file 
transfer protocol selected.

Speaking of file transfer protocol , Twisted's FTP seems like overkill 
for my simple scenario, though if I could harness the functionality I 
need, I'd use it.  I've also read up on Twisted's Producer/Consumer 
approach, which I'm thinking if I have to roll my own, this is the path 
I should take.  However, I surely can't be the first person in more than 
a decade to want to transfer a file while speaking AMP.

So, how do I switch back from a file transfer protocol to AMP and what 
existing protocol, if any, should I use for the transfer?

Thanks so much.

-Randall

Your code is mostly correct, but you are running the default Twisted reactor.  You need to use the asyncio reactor.  The article Kyle linked to (https://meejah.ca/blog/python3-twisted-and-asyncio <https://meejah.ca/blog/python3-twisted-and-asyncio>) describes the necessary set-up.  Hopefully in the future this will be more automatic!

Message-ID: <86wor78xqc.fsf@atlantis.meejah.ca>



-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

I'm very pleased to announce txtorcon 18.1.0. This adds or fixes the
following:

 * better error-reporting (include REASON and REMOTE_REASON if
   available) when circuit-builds fail (thanks David Stainton)
 * more-robust detection of "do we have Python3" (thanks Balint
   Reczey)
 * fix parsing of Unix-sockets for SOCKS
 * better handling of concurrent Web agent requests before SOCKS ports
   are known
 * allow fowarding to ip:port pairs for Onion services when using the
   "list of 2-tuples" method of specifying the remote vs local
   connections.

You can download the release from PyPI or GitHub (or of
course "pip install txtorcon"):

   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txtorcon/18.1.0
   https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon/releases/tag/v18.1.0

Message-ID: <2cb01d85-3ca4-9c9b-9366-0eebb1e58a0c@atleastfornow.net>

Hello everyone! It's time again for a Twisted release. It's not a huge 
one, but it does have some important changes!

Twisted 18.9rc1 features:

- Support for Python 3.7!
- Better support for Unicode handling in logging tracebacks in Python 2
- trial -j now reports tracebacks on test failures on Python 3.
- twisted.internet._sslverify.ClientTLSOptions no longer raises 
IDNAError when given an IPv6 address as a hostname in a HTTPS URL.
- HTTP/2 server connections will no longer time out active downloads 
that take too long.

You can get the tarball and the NEWS file at 
https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/rc/18.9.0rc1/ , or you can try it out 
from PyPI:

     python -m pip install Twisted==18.9.0rc1

Please test it, and let me know how your applications fare, good or bad! 
If nothing comes up, I will release next week.

The NEWS file displays with no line breaks on Win10 in either Firefox or 
Chrome.  This makes it essentially unreadable.  Going back to 
https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/rc/, and looking at the various 
release candidates, it looks like 17.1.0rc1 and before look like normal 
text files, but 17.5.0rc1 and later look like a single globbed line of 
text.  Probably not coincidentally, the good versions all list the 
Content type as [text/plain] whereas the unreadable versions are all 
[text/html]

This is actually a bug in Twisted itself, if you are keen to fix it :)

Previous versions have 'NEWS.txt', and Twisted knows about the MIME type for '.txt' files, probably via /etc/mime.types or similar.  Current versions have 'NEWS.rst', and twisted has a default MIME type of text/html (which is a terrible idea and should not be the case).

You might be able to fix this by eliminating the default MIME type from Twisted (although this would just let your browser do the sniffing, not sure if that would be better) or you could definitely fix this by teaching Braid <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid>> about text/x-rst <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html#what-s-the-official-mime-type-for-restructuredtext-data <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html#what-s-the-official-mime-type-for-restructuredtext-data>>.
