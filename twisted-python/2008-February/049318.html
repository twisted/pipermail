I would try to help you my friend, but I have no earthly idea what you're
talking about.  /temp/workfile?  So far as I know, sockets receive bytes,
not files. Does that help?? Anyhow, if you provided some sample code showing
what you're trying to do, someone might be able to help you.  It would also
be apropriate if your question actually had something to do with Twisted.

Cheers,
