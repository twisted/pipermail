</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Twisted
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> APIs are not threadsafe.  In order to call them from a thread other than
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the one in which the reactor is running, it is absolutely required 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> use reactor.callFromThread.  This is quite simple.  Instead of:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    proto.sendLine(&quot;line&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Simple do:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    reactor.callFromThread(proto.sendLine, &quot;line&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You will have to do this for every call you make to a Twisted API 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (except
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for reactor.callFromThread, of course ;).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have just tried this method, and it perfectly works.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The twisted reactor is run in another thread and the calls to Twisted 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are managed by the callFromThread method. The main advantage I see to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it (excepting the fact that it works) is that it does not require 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes in the way the graphic rendering is done : you do not care 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about how python- ogre runs to code the twisted part.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The best solution would be to really integrate the two loops.  I 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> don't know
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the details of OGRE though, so I can't tell you specifically how to 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> do this.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It is tightly dependent on the details of the loops being integrated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What I can't see for the moment is how much better it would be to do 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like the other ways delivered in the discussion thread (by Werner, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bernie an Stefan). These ways consist in running Twisted first and in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> letting it manage python-ogre (by doing the rendering frame by frame 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with coiteration, or loopingcalls).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is this better than doing separate threads ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are arguments about efficiency.  Using threads has overhead which is
</I>&gt;<i> not present when not using threads.  These arguments are probably not very
</I>&gt;<i> convincing in this case, since you would only have two threads and their
</I>&gt;<i> overhead will be dwarfed by your rendering costs.  You should be aware that
</I>&gt;<i> reactor.callFromThread _does_ have some non-trivial overhead.  Using it for
</I>&gt;<i> each sendLine call _could_ have a noticable detrimental impact on your 
</I>&gt;<i> app's
</I>&gt;<i> performance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are arguments about simplicity.  It's harder to understand what a
</I>&gt;<i> multithreaded program is doing.  It's harder to debug a multithreaded
</I>&gt;<i> program.  It's very, very hard to unit test a multithreaded program.  This
</I>&gt;<i> is probably the compelling argument to try to avoid threads.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Because most other event loops are very bad at managing events. :)  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> want reasonable network performance, you need a good network event 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> loop to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be in control.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Don't you think using basic sockets (easy to code in Python) to make 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the network connection from a client to a server is more efficient 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (considering the time spent to do it or the complexity of the code) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and more easy to keep in a project ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That might be nice.  However, almost without exception, the network code I
</I>&gt;<i> read which does not use Twisted is buggy in the most trivial ways.  It is
</I>&gt;<i> rare for it to take more than a cursory glance to notice critical bugs
</I>&gt;<i> (the sort which will result in data being lost).  Of course, this doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> mean that all network code written without Twisted is fatally flawed, but
</I>&gt;<i> it does give me a reasonable basis to assume that it will have issues. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted's APIs aren't just easier to use correctly than the BSD socket 
</I>&gt;<i> APIs,
</I>&gt;<i> they're also consistent across platforms.  Are you sure you know the BSD
</I>&gt;<i> APIs well enough to write some that is correct on Linux and on Windows?
</I>&gt;<i> (Let alone on OS X or FreeBSD)  Even if you are, would you rather spend 
</I>&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;<i> time writing the error handling logic for each of these platforms or adding
</I>&gt;<i> features to your game?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted may seems to be harder than the socket module.  It probably does
</I>&gt;<i> have a higher up-front cost.  However, in the long run, I think that you'll
</I>&gt;<i> save yourself a lot of time using it rather than using sockets directly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You also get the advantages which the structure Twisted attempts to impose
</I>&gt;<i> on your application confers.  For example, protocol/transport separation
</I>&gt;<i> means that you can unit test your protocol implementation very easily.  And
</I>&gt;<i> that's assuming you even need to implement your own protocol, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> using one of the protocols Twisted already includes an implementation of.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You also leave open the possibility of easily taking advantage of some 
</I>&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted features which don't seem useful now but which you may benefit from
</I>&gt;<i> later in development.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hope this helps,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It certainly lists a goodly number of reasons why people should strongly 
consider using Twisted, and there are a goodly number one doesn't come 
across every day.
