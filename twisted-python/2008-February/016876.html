I will have to do something as throttling is needed, but I'm just not
sure how to go about it. Do you have an idea of how it could be fixed?

The ThrottlingFactory methodology would seem to be broken and unusable
due to this behaviour. The only workaround I can think of is to modify
the push producer to keep a tally of the number of pauses received,
and only resume when it gets back to 0. That obviously requires
modifying the underlying producer, and is far from ideal as I believe
the pauseProducing() call is expected to be idempotent.

Or perhaps the ThrottlingFactory should create a dummy producer that
gets data from the real producer, but then throttles it before sending
it out to the twisted.internet.tcp.Server. That is complicated by the
fact that the producer would not be available to be modified by the
factory before it is passed to the Server, so exchanging it for the
dummy producer would also be a problem.

So, are there any other ideas of how throttling can be accomplished
with Twisted? I'm sure someone must have used throttling at some
point.

Thanks,
Cameron
