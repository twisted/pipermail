Okay, thanks for the explaination.

</I>&gt;<i> GnuTLS support in Twisted might be interesting. I have heard rumors
</I>&gt;<i> that OpenSSL is a higher quality implementation than GnuTLS, but I

Neither do I... :-)

&gt;<i> There's no reason Twisted couldn't support both of these libraries
</I>&gt;<i> and use whichever is available (or allow explicit selection). I
</I>&gt;<i> think there's even a ticket open in the tracker for this. But since
</I>&gt;<i> PyOpenSSL basically works, the motivation to work on this might be

</I>
Right, I can definitely understand that!

&gt;&gt;<i>Is there a cross-platform GPL compatible library out there that will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>give me TLS for Linux, Mac, and Windows on Python 2.4 and upwards?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's also TLSLite, which includes Twisted support. I don't have
</I>&gt;<i> any first-hand experience with it either, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's also M2Crypto, but since that's just another OpenSSL
</I>&gt;<i> wrapper, it probably doesn't take care of your license concerns.
</I>
Thanks for the pointers! I'll look more into this when I (or more
likely, someone else) really need SSL/TLS support on Windows.
