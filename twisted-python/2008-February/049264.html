There isn't much, if any, development happening on PyOpenSSL.  Partially,
this is because it does enough as it is now (although there are some
features it could provide which would be nice).  Partially it's because
the original author has disappeared into the void.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [snip licensing issues I don't have any clue about]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>* The GnuTLS has a nice (maybe biased) comparison page:

GnuTLS support in Twisted might be interesting.  I have heard rumors that
OpenSSL is a higher quality implementation than GnuTLS, but I don't have
any first-hand experience; it's possible this is just fud.

There's no reason Twisted couldn't support both of these libraries and use
whichever is available (or allow explicit selection).  I think there's even
a ticket open in the tracker for this.  But since PyOpenSSL basically works,
the motivation to work on this might be missing for a lot of people.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Is there a cross-platform GPL compatible library out there that will
</I>&gt;<i>give me TLS for Linux, Mac, and Windows on Python 2.4 and upwards?
</I>
There's also TLSLite, which includes Twisted support.  I don't have any
first-hand experience with it either, though.

There's also M2Crypto, but since that's just another OpenSSL wrapper, it
probably doesn't take care of your license concerns.
