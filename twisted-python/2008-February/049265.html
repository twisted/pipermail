I think you could have written the equivalent program in less lines of code
using facilities provided by Twisted.  And you'd have the benefits of a
number of things your program doesn't provide including:

* transport/protocol separation
* ability to handle multiple clients efficiently

It is not my area expertise by any means, but shared-secret message hashing
is a rather crude (read : easy to sniff and replay traffic) security
mechanism.

Cheers,
