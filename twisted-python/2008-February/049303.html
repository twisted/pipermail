<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; right ? Did Ottavio Campana manage to have something working and did
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; he publish the result of his modifications ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I got something useful, it's going to be deployed soon but
</I>&gt;<i> eventually I didn't come out with acls. Even though I have to say
</I>&gt;<i> ldaptor fits well in my project and for some aspects I'm happier than
</I>&gt;<i> with openldap.
</I>
Congrat !
Are you going to release the ldap code with an open source license ?

I'm in discussion with Tommi about adding ACLs, would you be
interested ? Beside, he told me ldaptor should be updated to work with
the latest on twisted, something you've done already ?

&gt;<i> I have a web application I wrote with twisted web. This application
</I>&gt;<i> saves data in a sqlite file. Whenever the user modifies it from the web,
</I>&gt;<i> the application updates also the files used by ldaptor, since what I
</I>&gt;<i> need is only to export them with ldap.
</I>
Yes, more or less what I want to do (based on mysql instead of sqlite).

What is the ldap client you use ? What is the ldap schema (my goal is
to read it from a mail client)

&gt;<i> It does not have acls, but I managed to get something similar by
</I>&gt;<i> patching how the ldap server works. Moreover, to prevent corruption I
</I>&gt;<i> modified how operations different from search behave.
</I>
&gt;<i> What do you want to do?
</I>
Quite simply provide LDAP access (bind, search, unbind) on the
contacts in a CRM (civicrm). I'm working for NGOs, and that's the
easiest I found to provide access to the address book from within
outlook/thunderbird/whatever mail client.

&gt;<i> About doc: in ldaptor/protocols/ldap/ldapserver.py I found nearly
</I>&gt;<i> everything I needed, give al look also to ldaptor/ldiftree.py to see how
</I>&gt;<i> not to store everything in memory but in a filesystem. Also give a look
</I>&gt;<i> at <A HREF="http://www.inoi.fi/open/trac/ldaptor/browser/trunk/test-ldapserver.tac">http://www.inoi.fi/open/trac/ldaptor/browser/trunk/test-ldapserver.tac</A>
</I>
Thanks ! Why didn't you try fetching directly from the db instead of
putting it in an intermediate file ?

&gt;<i> I hope it is enough, I've been able to understand how it works from
</I>&gt;<i> these files.
</I>
I hope too.

&gt;<i> Bye,
</I>
Sorry for the delay, it took me a while to get in touch with tommi and
move forward on how to work on that together.


What is your application ? Is this something public ?
