&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> right ? Did Ottavio Campana manage to have something working and did

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I got something useful, it's going to be deployed soon but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eventually I didn't come out with acls. Even though I have to say
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ldaptor fits well in my project and for some aspects I'm happier than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with openldap.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Congrat !
</I>&gt;<i> Are you going to release the ldap code with an open source license ?
</I>
well I think I think I'm releasing it opensource. Two days ago I 
discovered a tremendous problem in the software due to utf-8 encoding 
required by sqlite...

I'm trying to fix it, but it's not fixed yet, so I'd like to fix it 
before releasing.

 &gt; I'm in discussion with Tommi about adding ACLs, would you be
 &gt; interested ? Beside, he told me ldaptor should be updated to work with
 &gt; the latest on twisted, something you've done already ?

well, I'm sorry but I don't think I'll have time. I just finished my 
doctorate, so I'm looking for a postdoc and I do not know what I'm doing 
(by the way, if you are aware of some positions... ;-) )

&gt;&gt;<i> I have a web application I wrote with twisted web. This application
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> saves data in a sqlite file. Whenever the user modifies it from the web,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the application updates also the files used by ldaptor, since what I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need is only to export them with ldap.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, more or less what I want to do (based on mysql instead of sqlite).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is the ldap client you use ? What is the ldap schema (my goal is
</I>&gt;<i> to read it from a mail client)
</I>
I use sqlite instead of mysql because the software has to run on an 
embedded system. I use inetorgperson, since it works with all clients, 
as far as I know (and have tested).

&gt;&gt;<i> It does not have acls, but I managed to get something similar by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> patching how the ldap server works. Moreover, to prevent corruption I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modified how operations different from search behave.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you want to do?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Quite simply provide LDAP access (bind, search, unbind) on the
</I>&gt;<i> contacts in a CRM (civicrm). I'm working for NGOs, and that's the
</I>&gt;<i> easiest I found to provide access to the address book from within
</I>&gt;<i> outlook/thunderbird/whatever mail client.
</I>
I do not know this crm...

&gt;&gt;<i> About doc: in ldaptor/protocols/ldap/ldapserver.py I found nearly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everything I needed, give al look also to ldaptor/ldiftree.py to see how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not to store everything in memory but in a filesystem. Also give a look
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at <A HREF="http://www.inoi.fi/open/trac/ldaptor/browser/trunk/test-ldapserver.tac">http://www.inoi.fi/open/trac/ldaptor/browser/trunk/test-ldapserver.tac</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks ! Why didn't you try fetching directly from the db instead of
</I>&gt;<i> putting it in an intermediate file ?
</I>
that was the easiest solution. But if you have patches... :-)

&gt;<i> What is your application ? Is this something public ?
</I>
it is (wants to be in the future) a front end to asterisk. By now it has 
an addressbook, which can be accessed with a browser to execute calls or 
with ldap protocol.

I'm working right now to understand how to fix the encoding problem, 
please email me next week, when I hope I'll have fixed it.

Bye
