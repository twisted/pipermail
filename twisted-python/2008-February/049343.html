&gt;<i> Thank you Stephan, ok, but is an instance of a protocol created for 
</I>&gt;<i> every connection? I tried to add data received  by the protocol to a 
</I>
For TCP connections, assuming everything is coded correctly, yes.

&gt;<i> list, and if I get multiple connections that list is filled with all the 
</I>&gt;<i> connection's data, like if only one instance existed.

You didn't by any chance use a class variable did you e.g.:

class foo(...):
   my_data = []
   def dataReceived(self, data):
     self.my_data.append(data)

...is wrong. &quot;my_data&quot; is shared by all instances of the class and is 
mutable. You'll need to create instance variables, usually (I believe) 
as part of the factory process.

If you can write a minimal example showing the problem, someone can 
probably tell you what you're doing wrong.
