Maybe my assumption that I need to use a Protocol is wrong, if I need a 
specific transport.

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>OK. So what attribute(s) do I have to replace/override to plug my 
low-level read/write routines in a protocol ?

</I>
As I said above, I would like to interact with a set of (existing) 
applications that use unix sockets and TLV-based messages for 
interprocess communication.
They also use file descriptor passing with sendmsg/recvmsg.
In fact, this is the way they find each other: services announce 
themselves to a central broker, and clients ask for services to this 
broker. The broker then creates a socketpair and passes the file 
descriptor of both ends to each party.
They also make use of this file descriptor passing mechanism to use 
specific devices from different processes while keeping their state and 
&quot;ownership&quot;: once one process has made some initialization on a device, 
it can pass the descriptor to another process that can use it further.

The C framework on which these applications are written is completely 
asynchronous and the model seems fine.
I was able to use asyncore with eunuchs to do this low-level stuff as 
prototype, but I really would like to use Twisted instead.

As far as I can see, the low-level doRead and doWrite implementations 
are about the only thing I have to plug in the system to have it working.
In fact my sample code is mostly working, I just want to be sure I do it 
The Right Way, if at all possible.

Please, don't tell me Twisted is not made for something other than byte 
stream based comms... :-)

Thank you for your help.
