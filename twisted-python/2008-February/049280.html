&gt;<i>Hello,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What I would like to do is to put properly Twisted and python-ogre

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - First run python-ogre in the main loop. At a time, this loop launches
</I>&gt;<i>the twisted reactor in another thread with Thread(target =

</I>&gt;<i>20/30 seconds after.
</I>
Chris Armstrong's response to the post you refer to is accurate.  Twisted
APIs are not threadsafe.  In order to call them from a thread other than
the one in which the reactor is running, it is absolutely required that you
use reactor.callFromThread.  This is quite simple.  Instead of:

    proto.sendLine(&quot;line&quot;)

Simple do:

    reactor.callFromThread(proto.sendLine, &quot;line&quot;)

You will have to do this for every call you make to a Twisted API (except
for reactor.callFromThread, of course ;).

Since this is quite inconvenient, inefficient, and error prone, it's best
if you keep the interaction between different threads to the barest minumum
you can manage.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - So I tried not to run Twisted in another thread, by using the way
</I>&gt;<i>described here [2]. Twisted is given the main loop and the
</I>&gt;<i>rendering is done frame by frame with the coiterate. It works sometimes,
</I>&gt;<i>the renderOneFrame in the coiterration is not really working.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
What do you mean &quot;not really working&quot;?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But it seems more logical to run ptyhon-ogre in the main loop and
</I>&gt;<i>twisted on the side (in another thread for example, as soon as the client 
</I>&gt;<i>has decided to connect to the server). Have you any ideas how I could do 
</I>&gt;<i>this properly (with threads, without threads, with the coiterrate ...)?
</I>
The best solution would be to really integrate the two loops.  I don't know
the details of OGRE though, so I can't tell you specifically how to do this.
It is tightly dependent on the details of the loops being integrated.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If Twisted was originally made for MMORPGs, why the reactor wants so much to 
</I>&gt;<i>be in the main loop and to manage itself the other threads (with 
</I>&gt;<i>callInThread for example)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Because most other event loops are very bad at managing events. :)  If you
want reasonable network performance, you need a good network event loop to
be in control.
