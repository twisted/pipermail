you have to take this paper in CONTEXT of the previous paper tha one of 
these same authors wrote about a year earlier.
The SEDA paper -&gt; 
<A HREF="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=5&amp;url=http%3A//www.eecs.harvard.edu/%7Emdw/papers/seda-sosp01.pdf&amp;ei=IQcKQ6ilLMPc4QGu0rGXDg">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=5&amp;url=http%3A//www.eecs.harvard.edu/%7Emdw/papers/seda-sosp01.pdf&amp;ei=IQcKQ6ilLMPc4QGu0rGXDg</A>

Where they come to the exact OPPOSITE conclusion :-)

It is all good reading!

They are NOT promoting threads as much as they are promoting a better 
scheduler for threads. Which is what SEDA ( and Twisted ) provide with the 
event driven model. 

Their basic conclusion is that EXISTING threading implementations are too 
general/generic and a more specialized scheduler that is way more effiecent 
would make Threaded programs scale better AND have the more friendly Thread 
style interface.

Until someone picks up thair Carpaccio project and make it produciton 
worthy, we will probably just have to keep dealing with the complexity of 
event driven async programming idioms like Twisted.
