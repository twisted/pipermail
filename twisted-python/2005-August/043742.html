Right.  The bug the OP has here isn't that the adapter shouldn't have been
registered, but that the adapter fails to properly declare what interfaces
it provides, so that the result of IBar(IFoo(x)) will fail even though x -&gt;
IFoo and IFoo -&gt; IBar adapters are registered.

The performance question is important... benchmarks of any changes here
would be a good idea.

A weaker solution would be to only check at registration time, but that's
uglier, because it only works for adapters that are classes, and that don't
have creative __new__ methods.  That's almost certainly 99% of adapters, but
ugly and incomplete solutions make me nervous.

Anyway, the underlying zope.interface machinery allows this -- and includes
doctest documentation that relies on this (it registers *ints* as adapters,
iirc!).  I'm inclined to agree with your &quot;consenting adults&quot; approach, but I
don't feel strongly either way.

-Andrew.
