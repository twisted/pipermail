Hi Mary, sorry for leaving this unanswered for so long.  I've been ... 
busy :)

&gt;<i> My understanding of the license policy was as per
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/issue903">http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/issue903</A> -- ie, that the *only* thing

</I>&gt;<i> all that <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/developers/contributing">http://twistedmatrix.com/developers/contributing</A> currently

</I>&gt;<i> the licencing and copyright of my own contributions as of the date when
</I>&gt;<i> the MIT licensing of Twisted began.
</I>
OK, I apologize.  This was apparently the impression I gave many people.

Just for the record, my intent was originally that we leave all of the 
already-consigned contributors still consigned, refer to myself as 
&quot;Twisted Matrix Labs&quot; for the purposes of holding the copyrights, until 
such time as a foundation with that name could be established.  The 
individual contributors who could not consign (such as MIT) could be 
listed independently.

However, while the legal advice I've received over the years has 
conflicted, folks seem pretty unanimous on the fact that this is 
confusing and tenuous legally.  Let's just put the names of *all* the 
individual contributors back into the license.

I think that also obviates the need for the &quot;CREDITS&quot; file.
