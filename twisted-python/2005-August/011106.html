<PRE>Hello:

I would like to implement a backup client in Python - possibly with  
Twisted Conch or similar tools. I would like the client to operate  
like rsync through ssh, and I am not sure how I should approach this  
functionality. Can I use the OS' rsync through Twisted's ssh client?  
Is there a python module that can be used through twisted's ssh  
client? Has anyone on this list worked on anything like this?

I saw this posted on a newsgroup:


 &gt;  As for scp and rsync-ssh I don't know of
 &gt;any out of the box solutions, however if you're good with Python you
 &gt;may want to take a look at conch (a component of Twisted,
 &gt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/">http://twistedmatrix.com/</A>), which is a Python implementation of the  
SSH
 &gt;protocol.  I've personally seen it used to implement restricted  
virtual
 &gt;scp, but I don't think any such package has been released.  Twisted
 &gt;does of course also have a FTP component that can be used more or less
 &gt;out of the box.  I'm not really very familiar with the implementation
 &gt;of rsync, but I can't imagine it would be too hard to implement  
either.

I am not sure how true this is after reading the twisted docs and  
examples.

I did some searching in the twisted archives, but not all of it...  
sorrry in advance if this topic has been hammered into the ground.
