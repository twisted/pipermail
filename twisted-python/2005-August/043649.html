<PRE>We haven't even gotten to the second sprint yet (this weekend, Sydney,
see you there), and there's talk of a third one.

The Australian Open Source Developers Conference is being held at Monash
University, Caulfield, Melbourne from December 5th to 7th this year.
Seems like all of the Tassie Twisted folk are submitting papers and a
few others are thinking of submitting or attending.

Hence, while it probably won't be even as formally informal (or
informally formal?) as the Hobart and Sydney sprints, it seems likely
that critical mass will be achieved in Melbourne and Twisted coding
might take place...

....

Conference details:

Monday, December the 5th to Wednesday December the 7th, 2005

Call for papers is currently open:
<A HREF="http://osdc2005.cgpublisher.com/cfp.html">http://osdc2005.cgpublisher.com/cfp.html</A> but deadline is *this Friday*
19th August.

Details at <A HREF="http://www.osdc2005.com.au/">http://www.osdc2005.com.au/</A>

....

And after that... anyone going to linux.conf.au 2006 in Dunedin New
Zealand...?

-Mary
