Well ... I did do that at first but pgasync isn't quite dbapi compatible
and it also has a couple of oddities that I'm not sure about.

My memory is a bit fuzzy about all this now but the main thing is that
pgasync queues queries.

There's basically a chain of deferreds internal to a pgasync connection.
In some ways, it makes pgasync easier to use, because it looks like
stuff is not deferred, but I actually found it irritating after a while.
Personally, I think if something is async it might as well look async.

There are also a number of bugs (in my opinion) which mean pgasync is
not dbapi  compatible but those can probably be fixed over time.

Anyway, I agree that this would be good but there are a couple of API
issues that need solving first before it's possible.

Note: I don't think laxdb is an adbapi replacement. adbapi has its
advantages but at the cost of losing a bit of control over how and when
database operations happen. They're probably just different.
