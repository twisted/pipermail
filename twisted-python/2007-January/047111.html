Sure you can, you can check whether they break the old read already
existing
unit tests which were written with the &quot;intended&quot; functionality
of a particular module in mind when the module was first created.

Requiring people that submit patches that actually change or extend said
intended
functionality to also include unit testing code is perfectly fine.

But bug fixes that fix something which is somehow clearly
(in the responsible developer's view) intended functionality 
that is nevertheless not yet covered by an existing test
(obviously not ;) are a different matter...

Expecting twisted users that find such problems in Twisted to also
submit functional unit test is placing the hurdle
for bug fixes that get added to twisted quite high.

The idea of course is that later the Twisted developer
responsible for the module in question extends the unit
tests for that module's core functionality to also
include the bug fix case if they feel the need and/or
have the time.
