Well, from our side, we'd certainly be very interested in
collaborating with you.  Both Brian and I are developing ipython's
distributed computing capabilities because we need them in our
everyday work, and we'd be very happy to have more collaborators.
Brian knows a lot more about Twisted than I do so I'll defer detail
comments on your code to him, but as a general statement, we'd be
happy to have you on board.

Since this discussion may drift away from Twisted specifics and I
don't want to impose off-topic chat on this list, we'd be happy to
continue talking about the more ipython-specific questions on the
ipython lists (this is probably a -dev topic):

<A HREF="http://projects.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/ipython-dev">http://projects.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/ipython-dev</A>
<A HREF="http://projects.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/ipython-user">http://projects.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/ipython-user</A>

If you feel you'd rather discuss licensing specifics off-list first,
then by all means go ahead (if you've already talked to Brian, I'll
catch up on the details directly from him, don't worry).

Thanks for your offer!

Best,

f
