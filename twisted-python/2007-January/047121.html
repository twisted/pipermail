Race conditions are tricky, but in every case it is worth _trying_ to mock/stub/hook the code as it already is to demonstrate it deterministically.  It isn't always possible with a reasonable amount of effort, but very often it is actually quite easy.  As you do it more, it gets easier to figure out the trickier cases.

In any case, writing a test (which runs quickly) to be used with trial -u is a pretty low bar.  There are some extremely rare cases (mostly involving threading infrastructure) where those tests take a long time to fail, but even there it is usually possible to make them *succeed* reliably.

&gt;<i>Always feel free to file the ticket before figuring any of this out, by
</I>&gt;<i>the way.  It is still possible that it will strike someone else's fancy
</I>&gt;<i>and the rest of the work will be taken care of for you. :)
</I>
And of course this is always true.
