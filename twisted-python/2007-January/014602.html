I hope you'll see the irony here: &quot;Let's be more flexible on unit tests. The
existing tests should be enough, no ?&quot;. The answer is obviously no, because one
of the biggest problem when you fix code like this is regression.

Furthermore, writing tests often shows real problems of an API, so are a good
step in code evaluation. If code can't be tested well, it probably means it's
not good code (that's not universally true, of course).

&gt;<i> BTW, the patch in ticket #1794 is already included in 2.5, it probably
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be an active ticket anymore.
</I>
Thanks, closed. You'll notice this was corrected during the resolution of ticket
#428, which addressed problems in FTP tests :).
