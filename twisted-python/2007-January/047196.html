<PRE>From: &quot;Brian Granger&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">ellisonbg.net at gmail.com</A>&gt;
&gt;<i> Thanks for the code snippet.  I had thought about trying to implement
</I>&gt;<i> my own, less complicated solution for this issue but hadn't done
</I>&gt;<i> anything yet.  I will have a look at your code to see if I can adapt
</I>&gt;<i> it.  I am not dealing with files, but most of the ideas are the same.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the task queue stuff looks interesting.  It is actually pretty
</I>&gt;<i> similar to what we have implemented in IPython:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/Parallel_Computing">http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/Parallel_Computing</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have abstracted things at a slightly lower level to allow various
</I>&gt;<i> types of higher level constructs (such as task farming) to be built
</I>&gt;<i> easily.  We haven't build the task farming interface fully yet, but
</I>&gt;<i> that is on our list of todos soon.  It might be nice to use some of
</I>&gt;<i> your work when we implement the task farming interface, but
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately, IPython is BSD, so your GPL code won't help us much.
</I>
Well, as it says on the foss.eepatents.com site, &quot;If you want to use
this software under different terms ... feel free to contact me about
it. Maybe we can work something out, maybe not.&quot; :-)

I'm interested in the idea of some of the work getting adapted for
IPython (a great project!), even if the adaptation winds up being
licensed differently. Also, I have already done quite a bit of task
farming in another as-yet-private package of mine, &quot;AsynCluster&quot; (is
what it sounds like), which I'm planning to incorporate into
Twisted-Goodies. Collaborating with someone capable like yourself on
this would be great for both of us, I would think. So, let's get
together on this off-list soon!
