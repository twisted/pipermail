I just wrote a test program that uses downloadPage() and it downloaded  
both those URLs fine.

Are you still able to reproduce the problem? Does there seem to be any  
difference in downloading those URLs as part of a full run as opposed to  
individually? Do you have any proxies between you and those hosts? (Many  
ISPs have transparent proxies these days, *grrr*). If you can still  
reproduce then a traffic capture could be of use.

In any case, the deferred returned from downloadPage probably shouldn't  
take &gt; 1 hour to errback. It's certainly possible that downloadPage could  
need more than 1 hour to download a large file over a slow pipe, but  
that's not the case here. There should probably be reasonable timeouts  
that trigger when no data has been received for a while. I'm not sure how  
downloadPage works as I haven't looked at the code yet.

Please file a bug at <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac</A> (You will need to  
register first). Include all the information you have, and a minimal  
example program that demonstrates the problem if at all possible.
