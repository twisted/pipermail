I think this actually varies from case to case.  For a problem where all
of the relevant critical points cannot be hooked or mocked or stubbed or
what have you, then a combination of #2 and #4 seems correct to me.  You
should be able to demonstrate that a real problem does exist by adding a
test which will fail eventually when run repeatedly (eg, using trial -u)
and which runs for orders of magnitude longer without failing once a fix
has been applied.

Always feel free to file the ticket before figuring any of this out, by
the way.  It is still possible that it will strike someone else's fancy
and the rest of the work will be taken care of for you. :)
