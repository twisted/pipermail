&gt;<i> Yes! But there is another problem. Say, one wants some feature to be
</I>&gt;<i> supported in twisted. He/she sends a patch, but it is dropped by the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, I'd be happy to implement SCGI authentication (ticket
</I>&gt;<i> #1300). But it is better to know in advance, how core team want this
</I>&gt;<i> feature to be implemented. Otherwise it is just a lost time for me to
</I>&gt;<i> code and for the core team to view it.
</I>
I don't think this is a systemic problem. If you want to work on SCGI
authentication, and you want to know how the developers think it ought
to be implemented, then you 1. look in the ticket for implementing
SCGI authentication to see if any discussion has happened (or make
one, if it doesn't exist), and 2. ASK the developers how they think it
ought to be implemented. If nobody responds, then there is not much
interest and you can probably feel free to do it however you want.

It's as simple as that. As for a roadmap: sure, roadmaps are nice, and
it'd be good if our project had more direction, but this wouldn't
solve your problem. It's impossible to make a roadmap that would lay
out designs for every possible feature anyone would ever want in
Twisted.
