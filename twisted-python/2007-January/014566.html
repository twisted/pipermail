<PRE>I am looking at using PDA devices talking to a server over gprs.

I need to push data to the PDA over elapsed timeframes that might be 
hours. Naturally during this timespan the device may have been dropped 
from the network or acquire a different IP address.

However to push data to the PDA, I need to record the IP and port used 
by the PDA for its first contact since it is stuck behind a firewall.

The socket needs to be kept open on the PDA so the server can keep 
responding on the same session over a period of time.

Using straight sockets I can do this by holding the reference to the 
IP/port used by the PDA. And checking every now and then that the 
connection is still valid. But I am no comms expert and I need to keep 
track of over 100 devices and keep reliably sending messages to them at 
random intervals.

So, I thought it might be better to use some framework for the server 
since I am no expert on sockets.

But looking through the docs for twisted and some of the code, I can't 
see anywhere how I can get and use a reference to the port and reuse the 
open session on the PDA.

Can I do this with twisted or should I look for some other way of doing 
what I want.

I was thinking I could use irc with twisted but not sure if I am barking 
up the wrong tree.

Thanks for any ideas of solving the problem.
