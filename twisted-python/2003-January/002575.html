Yes, that's my fault.  I haven't gotten around to that yet -- I might have a
stab at it tonight, it shouldn't actually be that hard.  I'll try to make sure
I get this done in time for the 1.0.2 release.

Let me know if there are any other FTP commands you want implemented -- I've
also got MDTM on my todo list, which should be trivial (in fact, the
apt-proxy guys have already implemented it! :).  The current range of
commands more-or-less reflects what I needed for a previous job, and not
much more, but I'm happy to add any that someone else finds useful.  STOR is
definitely useful (and probably the hardest -- the code for uploading from
the client isn't really there yet).

DTPFactory is part of the FTP server, which currently shares no code with
the client.  The server is desperately in need of a rewrite/refactoring to
use twisted.web (so that you can have dynamic resources, and the like).
This is on my longer-term todo list...
