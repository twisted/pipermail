Depending on how much you like subway transit (it's actually really 
clean there, but only runs until midnight-2am latest.. used to be 
midnight but I hear they've extended it slightly on weekends), you can 
pretty much stay anywhere near a metro station and make it to PyCon 
pretty easily..  Presumably, since it's at GWU, it's going to be really 
close to the Foggy Bottom stop on the orange/blue metro line.. which is 
quite accessible from the red line (or any other, but particularly the 
red and orange/blue).  The metro system there is pretty quick, and 
cheap (non-rush hour it's no more than $2.20 USD each way.. not too 
much more otherwise).  I really can't suggest accommodations, as I used 
to live in the area and have plenty of friends to crash with in those 
parts (and never had to use a hotel for any legitimate purpose), but 
it's relatively easy to get around without renting a car so long as 
you're within walking distance of a metro station.

For those of you traveling from points north or south via Amtrak, the 
train stops at the Union Station stop (red line), with an easy transfer 
over to the orange/blue at Metro Center.

<A HREF="http://www.wmata.com/metrorail/systemmap.cfm">http://www.wmata.com/metrorail/systemmap.cfm</A> is the map of the 
metrorail system, where you could plot accessible hotels in the 
md/dc//va area.

And as far as internet access goes, you're probably SOL.. Net cafes and 
net access at hotels aren't very popular down there from what I 
remember.. if you're lucky you'll meet some cute college guy/girl that 
goes to a school at GWU / GMU / etc. and will let you &quot;plug in&quot; to &quot;the 
ethernet&quot; in her dorm, but that's the best you'll be able to do :)
