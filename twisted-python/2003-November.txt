Subject: [Twisted-Python] connectTCP/listenTCP socks/ssh
Message-ID: <20031101104118.GA21085@nixel.mine.nu>

I'm writing a socks proxy that uses ssh tunnels for connections, I can
get it working by making my connectClass listenTCP with a
forwarding.SSHListenForwardingFactory and then ClientCreator a
SOCKSv4Outgoing to connectTCP, but obviously that's a bad method. 

How can I cut the listen/connect? Is there a way I can do it at that
level or do I need to implement my own .connectSSH method?

It seems I need to get both sides placed in the reactor somehow,
but SSHChannel.conn doesn't have a fileno() so addReader doesn't accept it.
(Is addReader the right function? I found it in the curses example and
 am assuming it's just a generic file descriptor handler)

Thanks much

You should definatly look at adding this feature to Conch when you
finish it.  That's been on the TODO list for a while.

Basically, you're going to want to override SOCKSv4.connectClass and
SOCKSv4.listenClass.  connectClass returns a Deferred that is called
back with an unused value.  listenClass returns a Deferred that is
called back with a tuple of (host, port) that is being listened on.

I got it working this morning, I'll add to to conch (I assume you mean
the conch.py in the scripts directory?) and submit it. It
actually wasn't difficult, well the program is like 60 lines, but it took me
a good 12 hours of keyboard time to write and pleanty of idle brian
cycles. (But part of that was just because I'm new to twisted and
python)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] SNMPProtocol, request for review...
Message-ID: <3FA5534F.4030100@rogers.com>

I've built an SNMP Protocol for Twisted (based on a pattern from Patrick 
K. O'Brien), but as I'm a rather new Twisted developer, I'm wondering if 
someone more "in the know" could take a look at the package and see if I 
got the "ideas" right.  That is, whether I'm going about the entire 
thing incorrectly/correctly, or whether I've missed anything that would 
be obvious to an experienced twisted developer.

The protocol provides for sending get, getnext and getbulk requests, but 
doesn't yet support trap or answering any query (i.e. in SNMP-eese it's 
a manager-only protocol at the moment, not an agent-side protocol).

I'm particularly interested in:

    * whether the timeouts are handled properly (we do a crude callLater
      and check for deferred.called for them), is there a more elegant
      Twisted mechanism for handling timed-out operations?
    * whether the message IDs are handled properly (we just store all
      "live" messages in a dictionary and delete them when they are
      timed out or responded to), is there some more elegant Twisted
      solution?
    * whether the entire approach is okay. I put most of the code and
      API on the protocol object, with a helper object for managing
      tabular downloads.  Is there a more "Twisted" way of doing this? 
      Should the get method on the protocol be implemented as a separate
      object driving the protocol as well?  What should be in the
      "protocol" level, (as opposed to higher-level "application" code)?

Package is here:
    http://members.rogers.com/mcfletch/programming/TwistedSNMP-0.1.tar.gz
It requires pysnmp-3.3.5, available here:
    http://download.sourceforge.net/pysnmp/

You'll need an SNMP agent against which to test (as well as some OIDs 
for that agent), as the ips in the scripts won't work without the proper 
community IDs (or from unrecognised manager IPs, for that matter).

Feedback appreciated,
Mike

I haven't yet looked at your code, but there is a .setTimeout method on
Deferreds that sounds applicable here.  By default it will errback your
deferred with a defer.TimeoutError, but you can pass in a custom timeoutFunc
if necessary.

One thing to watch out for when using setTimeout is that you need to wrap
your calls to d.callback/d.errback in try/except defer.AlreadyCalledError,
in case the timeout does happen (alternatively you could pass in a
timeoutFunc that arranges for whatever would call callback/errback to be
cancelled, but that might be harder).  This is probably already the case
with your existing timeouts, though.

Again, I haven't looked at your code, but that sounds ok to me :)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Adapting RemoteReferences
Message-ID: <20031103134114.GA9164@twistedmatrix.com>

Hi,

What is the general opinion on having a standard way to adapt
RemoteReferences to specific interfaces which basically just
wraps callRemote for each respective method?

The reason i'm bringing this up is I can imagine various
use-cases for wanting to treat remote objects and local objects
as semantically equivalent. For example, I may be employing
the observer pattern for a simple system to separate UI components
from data components. Currently if I wish to have both remote and
local observers interoperate I would have to either store them
in separate data structures and treat each differently when
sending notifications, or, I could store them in a single
data structure and use appropriate type-checking to dispatch the
calls. IMHO both of these solutions are relatively ugly.

Whether or not there are sufficient use-cases for a standard twisted
way to do this is another story, so i'm wondering what the views of
people are on this subject. Certainly one could just register their own
adapter for RemoteReference in each case, but the code to do this is rather
ugly and for those that _do_ have to deal with such cases I think it would
be nicer to have a simple, standard way of doing it,
e.g. remoteRef.adaptTo(Interface).

I've written a function that outlines the functionality I think it should
provide which is included below; while this implementation is rather ugly
i'm more worried about the idea rather than how it would eventually be
implemented if someone decides this is worth having.

Of course, there are certain constraints, such as the method wrappers
having no way of knowing if the remote object actually implements the
desired interface or not, but I don't see this as a problem for something
that already requires string based dispatch. I guess you could say this
proposal is somewhat similar to java's 'stub' approach, only it doesn't
force it :-).

Cheers,

Sam.

I am writing a chat socket server and need to make sure that there are no
conflicts when writing to other attached clients. I am concerned that when
the server receives lots of messages from many socket connections, several
sockets may encounter write contention. 

Is there a queue for the write method of a socket? 
Should one expect errors in this regard?
Does the Twisted architecture eliminate this class of error?
Using twisted.protocol.basic can 2 lineReceived events happen
simultaneously? How is this addressed?

Twisted's network code is single-threaded.  Only one event is processed at
once, so the answers to your questions are:

> Is there a queue for the write method of a socket? 

No -- there doesn't need to be.  The transport will buffer any write that
isn't immediately writeable without blocking, but because you never do this
from more than one thread at a time, there are no possible races here.

> Should one expect errors in this regard?

Nope :)

Yep :)

They can't happen simultaneously. :)

  I think the preferred approach is the opposite.  Instead of taking remote
references and trying to treat them as local, take local references and
treat them as remote (this makes sense from an interface enforcement
consistency point of view, too -- it's easier to throw away some information
than you have than to pull information you don't have out of thin air).

  See twisted.spread.util.LocalAsyncForwarder.

Indeed, this does make more sense, I don't know why I didn't think of it in this
way. The way you have described also takes care of emulating the Deferred result
instead of having to specify it as part of the interface as well.

On the other hand, you still end up with basically the same level of interface
enforcement; that is, you can guarantee the interface characteristics of local
objects but not remote objects. This is unlikely to change however, without either
the protocol changing (unlikely - "did somebody mention IDL? :-)") or people obeying
their own interface definition conventions. Still, I can certainly see your point that
publishing an object as implementing an interface when it possibly doesn't is worse
than wrapping a local object with a single string-based dispatching method. 

Other small differences I can think of are that in cases where a system has already
been written and a remote interface is being provided, it may be easier to make
chanes to the effect of:

    # part of remote system wrapper class
    def remote_addObserver(self, observer):
        underlyingSystem.addObserver(observer.adaptTo(IUserInterface))

    # part of the underlying system
    # (code that was written prior to considering a remote interface)
    def addObserver(self, observer): self.observers.append(observer)

So if the underlying system was built without a remote interface in mind
it may be easier to just adapt the remote refs than to change every instance
of calls to the local objects.

If it _was_ written with the knowledge that a remote interface will be placed
on top in the future, I assume the code would look something like:

    # part of remote system wraper class
    def remote_addObserver(self, observer):
        underlyingSystem.addObserver(observer)

    # part of underlying system
    def addObserver(self, observer):
        if not isinstance(observer, RemoteReference):
            observer = LocalAsyncForwarder(observer, IUserInterface)
        # rest of method ...

And then all subsequent calls would use callRemote.

I guess which one you prefer is purely a matter of style and I can
see no real disadvantages from the later approach unless of course,
the system has already been written.

Thanks for pointing this out.

Sam.

The PB rewrite in warner's sandbox has (or will have, anyway) schemas
for security.

Until then, you need to do enforcement manually.

Message-ID: <401C60E417B68B48B14B53D845FF596A8D24FC@EMSS07M12.us.lmco.com>

I've got multiple input buttons and their view is the same logic. The logic
is delete some data on a button press, then rerender the page with the
updated data. The data it will remove depends on the unique ID of the button
pressed.  When the web page is rerendered the view gets called for each
button with the same http request, so the deletion logic will be evaluated
for each button, even though it should be evaluated for just the button that
was pressed. I don't like that. I want to clear request.args so the behavior
will be as if there was only one http event, corresponding to a single
button press. I tried "request.args.clear()", but that doesn't seem to have
the expected effect.

What's worse is when I click the browser's reload button, request.args still
has the last http request that occurred. In other words, if I click my
delete button the page will be rerendered with updated data, then if I click
the browser's reload it will try to delete more data as if I had hit on of
my delete buttons again. Can anyone help me with this problem?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0311020959380.13083-100000@shasta.stanford.edu>

I need a front-end to a complex of Zope systems.  The front-end listens on
an address/port and examines incoming http transactions, and, based upon
http headers and other information, connects to one or another of the Zope
systems.  The underlying approach is straightforward -- a Listener waits 
for a http transaction, it spawns a receiver which gathers the message, 
decides what to do, spawns a sender to the destination.  When the sender
responds, the process is reversed.  

I currently use an adaptation of Antony Baxter's pydirector to do the job.
I use his asynchat version, but have found that it leaks file descriptors
in my application.  I've not tried the twisted version.

So I thought I'd try to craft a tailored, light-weight version using 
the twisted framework.  I see how to manage things when everything works, 
but what if one or another of the endpoints fails?  How do I get 
everything cleaned up?

Why not use the Twisted version of pydirector? If it doesn't do exactly
what you want, submit patches.

The twisted version does nothing much different from the asyncchat 
version as far as I can see.   Both have comments about a race condition 
on closing which I suspect may be the source of my file descriptor leak.
(Actually, I think it's a socket leak... )

Nevertheless, I'd expect it'd be easier to fix a single bug than to
implement a whole program from scratch.

darn,  this was something I was also looking for,  but (sigh) that site
must be down right now,  I cannot get anything from that URL.   Would you
happen to know where I can find some good examples of forms processing I can
look at?     I'm still suffering from a lack of useful examples.  The Twisted
tutorial doesn't cover ANY examples of how to process forms pages.

I'm also looking for an implementation of a SMTP server.  A simple one,  just to show how all the components are tied together.   This is what Twisted really lacks,  documentation on how everything is tied together.   The tutorial covers some of that,  and does pretty good job,  but there are NO existing documentation on how to implement the simplest of SMTP servers,  although it appears there are alot of object that support it,  there just isn't any documentation that tell me how it's all tied together.

Vickey,

  Here is something that could get you started.   "request.args" returns a 
dictionary of the forms data,  including buttons.

  Copy and paste this code into your Python window and run it,  and 
using your browser,  go to this URL  http://localhost:8080 and play
with it.

from twisted.web import server, resource
from twisted.internet import reactor

class Simple(resource.Resource):
	isLeaf = True
	def render(self, request):
		"""
		request.args.get('key', '') gets the forms values.  This

		you could handle your forms page right here.  In this example
		I have a textfield called "Field" as you see in the HTML below.

Hi guys,

is there a way to have one service start several processes ?
When using twisted everyone connecting to the server ends in the same process. 
This leads to "slowing down" when requesting information whenever a certain 
number of people go on. Each request takes some time to process and meanwhile 
the server is less responsive. I have one particularly expensive function 
that takes a bit. So if several people happen to use this function at a time 
the server slows down, up to where it takes a minute to complete.
It's not a problem of system ressources (it's a quad processor xeon server 
with plenty of RAM and ultra 320 scsi drives running only this application 
and the postgres backend). The machine has a load of 0.2 while slowing down.
Basically most of the machine is idle, since it only runs 2 processes and has 
4 processors.
Is there a way to have twisted do something like apache or postgres and split 
the incoming connection to several processes ? It's not a web application, 
I'm solely using pb.
BTW: You might suggest to break down the expensive function into smaller 
pieces - no way. It has to run in one database transaction otherwise I might 
end up with a inconsistent database - no good in finance business.

Thanks

	UC

What does this expensive function do? If it's standalone, involves heavy
computation, or blocking resources, running it in a thread pool should
allow you to improve latency. In cases where it goes into C code, it
should also improve performance as it should release the GIL when doing
that.

If that isn't good enough, Quotient has some code for dispatching tasks
to multiple processes.

This is possible, although not as easy as I'd like it to be.  In 
principle, on most UNIX-based OSes, it's possible to listen() and 
accept() in one process, pass the returned file descriptor to a 
subprocess and do communication there.  I'd like to make this automatic 
at some point, but won't have the time to do it for at least another few 
months.

The fact that it's not as graceful or automatic as I like doesn't mean 
it's impossible though.  If you want to just have one "control" process 
that shuttles around I/O and N worker processes that do the actual work, 
you can still use spawnProcess and communicate over stdin/stdout to the 
subprocesses about new connections using a simple protocol which 
multiplexes multiple socket connections down to the one pipe connection 
and back.

Also, if database latency is your main problem, or you can move a little 
bit of performance-sensitive code into C and relinquish the GIL while 
they're happening, you can just use callInThread to run your 
transactions in threads instead of having the reactor waiting on them.

Is this helpful?

Would it help you to have the ability to open a database transaction and
keep it open while you do other things?  I have a patch to adbapi that
adds an API to do this.  It's in daily use on my development system but
I haven't quite finished cleaning it up for submission. 

b.g.

This is also useful for using privileged sockets (ports < 1024).  For 
example, on OS X in a GUI environment one can start a subprocess with 
root privileges w/ the Authorization framework, open the privileged 
socket, and pass it back to the parent process that does not have root 
privs.

Am I severely confused here?
The entire point of Twisted (to me anyway) seems to be
to  provide non-blocking interfaces to long-running
and/or blocking resources.

I thought that was the whole point of it being
event-driven.

Long-running yes, blocking, no. There is no magic way to make a blocking
API not-block. So you need to either rewrite from scratch, or use
threads.

For example, "send an email and return success or failure" can be
written using non-blocking APIs, since sockets have non-blocking APIs.
Calling a DB-API database adapter's cursor.fetchall() method can not
(unless you want to rewrite the database's wire protocol).

But cant I write my code in a manner so that even if
every database call timed out infinitely, my
non-blocking access to it will simply deferr every
response until my machine runs out of resources to
handle the stalled db connections?
(while still responding promptly to the front end web
connections)
That's my understanding at least...

I'm already doing that, but without using adbapi. When I started this project 
adbapi was no choice and now it's simply not an option to rewrite a lot of 
code to something I expect to be even slower than my code. I use a very lean 
row class based on slots and a db interface that handles the schema itself 
without me supplying it. This certainly is database dependant but I can 
afford to support postgres only.

I figured that the impact of callInThread is much higher to the rest of the 
system than I like. I'm already using deferToThread a lot, however there are 
limits to the usefulness of threads.  For example I use it to do page 
formatting (printjobs). Each of the printjobs is about 120 pages to format. 
If I start 20 to 30 such formatting jobs with deferToThread twisted virtually 
becomes unresponsive. If I limit to a max of 3 or so it works. I admit I 
don't understand this, since IMHO defering to a thread should make it 
independant from the parent. I didn't dig into this problem since It's not a 
big deal to limit to a few such jobs at any given time and use a spooler type 
interface to suspend requests for later.

I think I suffer from database latency in general and with the expensive 
function in particular. The expensive function could be moved to a thread and 
maybe I'll give it a try. However if I do this for every method that writes 
more than 10 or 15 records to the database I'll most likely end up with 
thousands of threads. Currently the system is used by up to 15 people, but 
projection goes to 400+ people at any given time. I don't have a problem with 
having people wait for a result, I have a problem with the other people that 
don't get a result because the framework stops responding for a couple of 
functions that just take more than a millisecond to execute. 
I'd rather have 500 processes like with apache and have the OS do the 
scheduling - which is way more efficient than having the framework schedule.
The most expensive function I have (besides the printing mentioned above) 
executes in about 3 seconds. This is not "blocking" in my understanding, 
since the function never waits for something to happen, it just calculates 
and stores stuff. Twisted is unresponsive for those 3 seconds. Multiply that 
by 10 users and one user might end up with a delay of more than 30 seconds 
before his "3 seconds" are evaluated. If I had a lot of processes the OS 
would schedule that more efficiently since then the function might take 5 
seconds to complete, but it would be interrupted by the OS scheduler to hand 
processing time to one of the other processes. 

Maybe I'll look into splitting into n worker processes. Since this would 
involve going into twisted code, where would I start looking ?

Yes. If you run the database query in a thread.

  But it doesn't, not in Python.  Each thread adds new contention for the
GIL, which makes every thread less responsive.  If the print jobs were
managed by a C extension which could release the GIL before doing its work,
then they would be mostly independant.

  Yea.  If you only have 4 CPUs, it doesn't make sense to be running 400
CPU-bound threads :)

  It is blocking.  While the term usually refers to a function that waits
for some I/O to finish, it applies equally well to any functions that run
for a non-trivial amount of time and, while doing so, prevent the rest of
the application from proceeding.

  Before doing that, you might consider just spawning a handful of worker
threads and giving them queues.  This keeps the application responsive by
not forcing an insane number of context switches but also still allowing all
the expensive functions to run independently of the I/O thread.  

  There is even a ThreadPool class in Twisted already (though I have never
used it myself ;), so giving this approach a try should be pretty quick, and
if it is still not good enough, you haven't lost much time.

  This is not to say that multiple processes would not also be a good
solution, just that it might be a harder one to implement.  If you do end up
looking at multiple processes, reactor.spawnProcess() (as glyph alluded to
earlier) is one way to go about it.  This is basically the equivalent of
popen2() (though with a lot more flexibility).

  On a related, but not necessarily useful note, I've recently begun
investigating ways of moving the state associated with a user request,
including the associated socket object, between processes.  My use case is
not load-balancing, but the code should apply equally well to this as to
what I intend to use it for.  It requires C extensions (which are currently
-just- good enough to play around with higher-level stuff in Python with). 
The code is very short, and lives mostly in sandbox/exarkun/copyover/fdpass.py
in CVS HEAD.

No, Twisted has a thread pool, so if you are using Twisted APIs you
won't get more than the max number of threads the pool is configured to
use.

If Twisted is unresponsive, that means it blocks. Any function that
takes more than 10ms should probably count as blocking, really. Try
running it in a thread. Because of the global interpreter lock, this
won't reduce runtime, but it'll enhance responsiveness to other clients.

In general, it sounds like you are doing a lot of database queries. Some
ways to optimize this:

1. Do less queries - cache, merge identical requests, etc.. 
2. Do a number of queries in a single transaction in a single thread,
rather than deferToThread, get result, run another query with
deferToThread again, etc..
(3. Don't use RDBMS. Use an in-process database like ZODB or Quotient's
atop when it's done.)

Don't use it! :)  Use reactor.callInThread, as we've been saying.
ThreadPool is an implementation detail of the default reactor, at this
point.

I know and I increased the threadpool limit a bit. Not much though because in 
the end it all runs on one cpu. I asume that if I start say 50 threads via 
deferToThread and the pool limit is 25 the requested threads are started when 
one becomes available ?

Responsiveness is what I need. Users are happy to wait a couple seconds if one 
can notify him and his screen still shows some "progress".

Yep - I already started moving some of the things into the database as stored 
procedures. This reduces the execution time tremendously since it get's rid 
of the DB API overhead. I know I still have some optimization potential by 
handing data blocks between methods so a particular method doesn't have to 
requery the database for something an other method already did.

I already do this, at least in some parts. You're right, the thread handling 
overhead is way too high to have single simple queries running in a thread 
each. It doesn't make sense to use a thread which costs you 1ms to set up for 
something that only runs 1ms.

:-) I'd probably do that with a web application, but even there I'll allways 
prefer a "real" database system. In process databases may be faster, therefor 
they are less relieable and correcting errors is a virtual impossibility.
Also the sher size of the data I handle would make something like ZODB blow up 
to a couple gigabytes in one month alone. 
Since my customers generally can afford it I rather use big iron for a couple 
thousand $$ to make the database faster. Specially in the finance and 
insurance industry it also makes the management happier if they see some big 
machines that look impressive in the rack. That's what they're used to and it 
gives them confidence in their investment (although one probably only uses 
10% of the machine :-) )

That explains it. Maybe I'll go ahead and create a separate "print" server 
process that just produces paper. I'm using reportlab and I even had to turn 
off the c extensions used in reportlab, because they are not threadsafe. 
Printing isn't a big deal at this time, simply because I gave them a "print 
later" checkbox which will suspend formatting and printing for the night. At 
night I then just process all the printjobs sequentially.

I think a mixture of both might be the best approach. Having several processes 
would be great for MP machines, so one has the ability to scale on a hardware 
basis. Making more intelligent use of threads could increase responsiveness. 
One user is fine wating  for something to happen, but all the others 
shouldn't have to wait for the one user too.

I'll check that out. I wouldn't name it load-balancing. Would be interesting 
though to check if one could have a single "socket server" that distributes 
to several processes on several machines :-) For an application like mine 
load balancing might be much easier, since I could make the clients reconnect 
to a different server/port.

They are not distributed as far as I know, but the .spec file
(Twisted/admin/twisted.spec) should produce RPMs without trouble.

My question goes along the previous one in this thread.
How do you get the browser to prompt for a username and password?
My code is not woking and goes something like this: On every page request 
a certain function is called, say genpage()...

def genpage(request)
     request.getUser()
     request.getPassword()

     return "hello world"


-> Browser does not prompt though. (And this does not even involve woven)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] SelectReactor, readers and writers
Message-ID: <20031106164555.GA16990@psychlaw.com.au>

Hi,

While looking at the code for the default SelectReactor I noticed
that the selectables are stored in the form {object : 1, ...}.
Is there any particular reason they're not stored in the format:
{ fd : object, ...}? A couple I can think of are that duplicate
file-descriptors would cause problems (which they currently most
likely would anyway) and objects which return different values from
fileno based on context would no longer work correctly -- are either
of these use-cases valid?

The reason i'm bringing this up is because since 2.3 (I think) calls
to socket.fileno are wrapped in a python function (as defined in
socket.py) which I assume, when called in a tight loop over a large
number of objects may result in a bottleneck (I certainly remember
profiling code in the past where this was the case).
This could be alleviated by passing a sequence of integers to select
instead of the connection objects themselves.

It could be that i'm missing something, or it could also be that this
has never come up because until a short time ago socket.fileno was, of
course, a C function :-).

Another thing to think about for the future is that on September 10
selectmodule.c was changed so that select.select now supports any
sequence. Currently SelectReactor makes a list from the readers
and writers dictionary (calling dict.keys()) every iteration -- of
course this is likely to remain the same for a while considering
the need for backwards compatibility and i'm not even sure if the
patch has been backported to 2.3 yet (unlikely since my 2.3.2 is
dated Oct 6 and it does not exhibit this behaviour). Still,
it's interesting to note for the future.

Cheers,

Sam.

Hi!

I noticed a couple of posts about 1.1rc's failing to build on Win32, due 
to the the installer not being able to find certain files (rpc.h, and 
portmap.h), but I've not seen any updates.  This problem still exists

Comment out the section that tries to compile the extension needing
rpc.h in setup.py (That's what I did). Just subsititute the test that
tries to find out if rpc.h is available with False so that the branch
is never entered.

Also when you get the build to work the twisted.scripts.twistdw.py
script is broken, fix it by looking at twistd.py.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] MANIFEST.in for RPMs
Message-ID: <oprx5rlf08k1a6kk@sfmail3>

If anyone has an interest in using the bdist_rpm option with setup.py to 
build Twisted RPMs, the MANIFEST.in file needs the following additions:

     include twisted/runner/portmap.c
     include twisted/protocols/_c_urlarg.c
     include twisted/lore/template.mgp
     include twisted/web/woven/FlashConduit*
     include twisted/web/woven/WebConduit*
     include twisted/test/process.alias.sh*
     include twisted/test/rfc822.message
     include twisted/test/server.pem

Also, for a Twisted installation that works with any installed version of 
Python (e.g. 2.2 and 2.3), you can install Twisted to /usr/lib/site-python 
by adding these lines to setup.cfg:

     [install]
     install-lib = /usr/lib/site-python

/usr/lib/site-python seems far more convenient than 
/usr/lib/pythonX/site-packages, don't know why it isn't the default.

The view factory is called once per use of that view in the template.
If you use the view for three buttons, your view factory gets called 
three times. Whether there were any button presses or not.

Maybe you should move your "delete" logic from the view to the render 
method, or to a model that is used only once in the template. That is 
only called once per request, and is a logical place to do some processing.

You should use a POST method for submitting the form; then the browser 
is not allowed to just resend the request without confirming the action 
from the user.

You should look at having a pool of worker _processes_, to which you 
dispatch work with pb.

Not threads, as python threading will not really scale, and there's 
really no point in threading if the amount of input/output to the worker 
is small enough (shared mem has its good and bad sides).

If you listen in a parent process, fork multiple children, and make the 
children accept, unix does the right thing. I don't think Twisted knows 
how to do that out of the box, but it should be doable.

That's assuming you don't need (much) shared data between the children.

If you are lucky, you can find a threading DB library (adbapi) that 
actually scales. The other mail in this thread are more helpful there..

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Deferred problem
Message-ID: <000001c3a471$e6b30ee0$687ba8c0@vicky>

I know that I'd already post a message about deferred but I think I
haven't understand very well.
 
I have a function that is suppose to return a new dictionnary but it
returns a deferred.
 
 
class MainPage(pages.BasePage):
    templateFile = "main.html"
  
    def initialize(self, dbpool=None):
        self.dbpool = dbpool
    
    def setUp(self, request, *args):
        var = self.initPermissions(request)      #var is suppose to get
the new list
        print var
 
    def wmfactory_welcome(self, request):
        return "Bienvenue, %s" %
request.getComponent(myguard.Authenticated).name
 
    def initPermissions(self, request):       #create and return the
results of a sql query
        group = request.getComponent(myguard.Authenticated).group
        listGroup = group.split(',')
        sql = "select permission from permissions where 1"
        for item in listGroup:
            sql += " or permissions.group='%s'" % item.lstrip()
        theDeferred = self.dbpool.runQueryDict(sql)
        return theDeferred.addCallback(self.makeDict)        # suppose
to call makeDict when the results has arrived
 
    def makeDict(self, results):
            # when I print what is in results, I can see all the data
from the sql query
        listPermissions = []
        for item in results:
            listPermissions.append(item.get('permission'))
        return listPermissions                   # return the new list
but the function setUp receive a deferred
 
 
I've put some comments in the code to help you understand what I want.
The big problem is that var receive a deferred and not the new list

Because it's wrong. Twisted has C extensions, and those are specific to 
the version of Python used to compile Twisted.

Even without C, the bytecodes generated for the installed .pyc files are

That python will try and import every time, and if you don't have the 
same python version installed it will recompile them every run.. and 
not be able to save them for permissions reason.

Handling form input in a way which is both very abstract and easy for 
the programmer to use without a lot of edge cases has turned out to be 
very difficult. As you may have heard, 'nevow' is the name of a new 
exploratory implementation of the woven ideas which will eventually 
become woven 2.0.  One of the goals of nevow is to take the ideas 
originally explored in twisted.python.formmethod and 
twisted.web.woven.form and re-implement them so they are cleaner, 
easier to use and extend, and have fewer edge cases. The new, 
in-development modules are nevow.formless and nevow.freeform.

Formless is a module which allows you to annotate object properties and 
method parameters with types (By declaring that the 'foo' property is a 
String, and the "bar" method takes two Integers, for example). Freeform 
is a module which uses this type information to automatically render 
forms on the web, perform input validation and form error rendering, 
and ultimately call methods on your objects or set properties on your 
objects.

I am at this very moment doing a lot of freeform development, so now 
would be a good time to raise your use cases, your expectations about 
using a system which renders and validates web forms, etc.

A good place to contact me is in #twisted on irc.openprojects.net. My 
nick is fzZzy.

I have been put in the unfortunate position of having to 'renovate' a 
lot of existing WebKit oriented CGI scripts. As you would surmise, they 
are a complete failure wrt OO design.

The main use case for me is to generate a form that in itself sets the 
constraints, and thus not requiring much input validation. All the 
scripts I have to deal with present varying views into a DB. Without 
delving into the schema makes it hard to convey what I need.

I guess all I was looking for with Woven was some OO based mechanism to 
build a form w/o all the wvfactory and wmfactory methods for each form 
'widget'

I will take a look at Formless and see how far that gets me.

Thanks for your time!

setUp is receiving a Deferred from self.initPermissions, but then doesn't
wait for its result to arrive.  You should instead do something more like:

        def setUp(self, request, *args):
            d = self.initPermissions(request)
            def printVar(var):
                print var
            d.addCallback(printVar)

Although ideally you should add an errback too, even if it is just
twisted.python.log.err.

(I don't know how this will interact with the rest of Woven, but hopefully
I've clarified how you should be using Deferreds a little)

-Andrew.

Good link. I might start using that for some things.
For now I solved the scaling issue with an (more or less) ugly workaround. 
Since I'm using pb with  dedicated client software I made the logon a 2 step. 
The first step connects to a certain port and gets an IP-address and a port 
back. The server determines which process has the least number of clients 
connected and returns that address. That's where the client then connects for 
real work. So I now just have a bunch of twisted's running on different ports 
- - works nicely for a quickhack.
But in the long run I'll definitely have to do something about the database 
and automatic forking of more server processes.

class Foo:
    def doStuff(self):
        ....

You have to have the request.

session = request.getSession()
session.foo = Foo()

Now later in your application you can do:

foo = session.foo
foo.doStuff()

If you use the twisted web server for more than one logical
application you should probably do something like this.

class MyApplicationSession:
   .....

session = request.getSession()

session.sessions = {}

session.sessions[MyApplicationSession] = MyApplicationSession()

And something similar but another class for other applications.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] pb help needed.
Message-ID: <ullqspdi5.fsf@inout.no>

I have a bug in my woven application which manifests itself as
win32select failing after doing many http requests. The error is the
constant WSAENOBUFS and I it seems pretty likely that this is caused
by some socket related resource leaking for each request I make. This
hypothesis is further supported by observing that a host of
pb.ClientFactory instances are stopped when shutting down the
application after it crashes. This seems strange to me as I am
thorough in shutting down the connector after every request is
finished.

Turning to that trusty friend printf style debugging, shows that the
PBClientFactory is stopped correctly when performing requests to pages
that use the referenceable and wait for it's deferred's to
complete. There are two cases when it doesn't stop. 

The first is when I press reload quickly a number of times. Then I
just see start messages because my request finish method is not called
(it is a callback to the deferred returned by request.notifyFinish()).

The second case is when I call disconnect on the connector before it's
deferred has been realised. I see in the log the following pattern:
Starting pb.PBClientFactory, disconnect and then the attached event,
stopping factory is not called at all. After stepping I see that
disconnect doesn't do anything when it is called before the connection
has been realized.

So I have a bug, and it's in my code. My question is how does one
manage pb resources correctly and easily (I don't worry about
performance just yet) when each user needs to have it's own
connection?

Here is what I have come up with so far. It doesn't solve the problem
where I don't get the request finish callback, but seems to be able to
disconnect even if not connected when disconnect is called.

class MyPBClientFactory(pb.PBClientFactory):
    def disconnect(self):
        if not self._broker:
            deferred = self.getRootObject()
            deferred.addCallback(
                lambda unused: pb.PBClientFactory.disconnect(self))
        else:
            pb.PBClientFactory.disconnect(self)

Since the last post I moved to a persistent PBClientFactory so that
disconnects is not a problem. This fixes the crashes, but there are
still resources that are not released. I only see perspective attached
messages in the log, until I kill twistd when I get a host of detached
messages. My next question must be how do I detach the perspectives in
an orderly fashion after each request? This seems to run into the same
problems as I had with not being able to do cleanup for each request.

Hi,

I'm playing with woven and twistd. Every time I change something, I have
to stop the server, and start it again (except for HTML changes in
templates). Am I doing something wrong ? This is very painful to restart
every time !

I'd love to see a deploy tool like a j2ee application server (you would
just put your tap in the deploy environnement, and the app server loads
it automatically). There was such a tool before in twisted, but it was
removed :( (can't remember the name).

thx for advice !

Syver,

I'm the win32 buildmeister, so I'm looking for this bug to see if I can
reproduce it.  Are you sure you hit "save" on the bug? I can't find it
on any combination of win32, compile, build, windows...

Also, assigning it to me probably wouldn't be a bad thing.

The twistw bug was submitted, and has already been fixed:

I see no sign of the build problems in the bug tracker, though.

I just discovered the twisted-1.1.0 API doc.
The "Inherited from ..." part are a GREAT idea ! Does it come from
epydoc, or it's twisted related ?

Isn't this a fairly significant change to the API?  Now doing
deferred.addErrback(log.err) will log the error, and then log it again when
the deferred is garbage-collected...

I guess it won't actually break anything, just add some confusion to log
files, but what's the new idiom for

    d.addErrback(log.err)   # log and swallow any errors that happened

going to be?

Yes, and an unnecessary one.  Revert it, and add a 'passerr' method, if 
you really need one.

Actually, it will break things, as exarkun pointed out on IRC:

	foo.addErrback(log.err).addCallback(cleanup)

will no longer call 'cleanup'.  Totally unnecessary breakage.

How does twisted shut things down and recover resources when implementing 
a reverse-proxy.  If one or another of the endpoints dies, I would expect 
there to be some shutdown code to close open sockets, etc.  but I don't 
seem to be able to find it.  Can someone assist?

anyone here using Quotient?
it builds, but on 'mktap quotient' i get an error
where it tries to build 'atop'.
it tries to import '_bsddb'. I am using bsddb3 - which
i believe is the more recent version of bsddb. i can
fix the import, but then i have problem with procs

bsddb3, but doesn't seem to be available.
any thoughts/clues?

It sounds like both your pybsddb  bindings and bsddb system library are

How does one detach a perspective? Is there a callRemote method on a

1.1 no longer has the concept of detaching. You can track live
perspectives and choose to not allow users to login if there's still a
connection, or not as you will. Look a bit at
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/pclients, and put the
appropriate logic in your realm'ds requestAvatar.

I'm not used to having actual users for this code :)

I'll see about adding it sometime this week and doing a new release. 

Long term plans include rewriting to use java.nio when newpb is done, so
if java 1.4 is a problem better say so now. Probably will include EIO
high-level async framework and Straw PB-based transparent java RMI if I
can, and maybe even java cred so you can write PB servers easily.

I put a somewhat different version there.
Outside of some cosmetics, not that it .addBoth the logout to the
notifyDone. This is important: the user should be logged out if the
request is severed mid-output

Of course, simpleguard.MarkingRealm can be used for that :)

Dear All Twisters out there.

I am a complete Twisted newbie (with a little bit of Python experience) 
and having just installed this (what looks like) a great package, I 
would like advice on my next step.

I am looking to start doing simple (spider) based web clients but really 
would like a guide or tutorial before jsut spending hours pulling my 
hair out. Where do you advise me to go. I have had a look at the 
Tutorial on Finger but this seems like a major development in an area I 
don't even understand.

Is there any specific newbie guides being built or assembled  possibly 
by those on this list.

Thanks for your help with something that could just change my life (well 
a bit of it anyway).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted and mod_python?
Message-ID: <JAEDJDIBADCJHPFLNEDFIEHKCBAA.pb_twisted@olga.mine.nu>

I am wondering about the feasibility of using mod_python in an Apache server
to make PB requests to a Twisted application.

That is, I have a Twisted application which servers PB requests, e.g. a user
manager. I also have an Apache server. I would like the Apache server to
present dynamic web pages based on the contents of the user manager
application, to act as a web front end (e.g. create/erase/modify user
properties). I was thinking that it could be possible to use mod_python and
Twisted to act as a client to the user manager.

My questions are:

1. Is this possible, fesible and/or reasonable? If so, any hints or examples
would be welcome.

2. Any alternative/better solutions?


I suppose it would be rather easy to use CGI instead, but I'd like to
explore the options.

and i want to access that app.registry attribute from an arbitrary

i seem to remember hearing that there was only one instance of Application
in a process, so does that mean that there's some (forgive the Java-speak)

  The old way of doing this would be...

    from twisted.internet.app import theApplication
    theApplication.registry

  However, this bites.

  Newly written programs should implement makeService() instead of
updateApplication().  As a bonus, purely service-based programs can easily
and cleanly do things like the above:

    from twisted.application import service

    class RegistryService(service.Service):
        def __init__(self):
            self.registry = registry.Registry()

    def makeService(config):
        s = RegistryService()
        ...
        anotherS = SomeotherService()
        anotherS.setServiceParent(s)  # Or s.setServiceParent(anotherS)
        ...
        return s # or return anotherS

  `s' can be the parent service of other services, in which case it can be
accessed simply by looking up the parent service, or it could be a child
service of something else, in which case it would be accessed via a call to
getServiceNamed() on the appropriate parent.

  This avoids the need for globals and lets services/applications be more
readily configurable alongside other services/applications (since neither
will have global state that might interfer with the other).

Okay, that answers another question I had, but I'm still not clear on how
to get at that service object from a couple of places.

For example, here's my Realm implementation:

class InnerSpaceRealm:
    __implements__ = portal.IRealm

    def requestAvatar(self, avatarId, mind, *interfaces):
        if pb.IPerspective in interfaces:
            registry = ### how do i get this?
            avatar = UserPerspective(mind, registry.get(avatarId))
            return pb.IPerspective, avatar, avatar.logout
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError("no interface")

what's the right way to get that service object?

this issue comes up again in my UserPerspective class, where i need to
access that registry object during perspective_xxx methods...

there is a part of me that just wants to use registry as a one-off class
with a class variable that returns the current instance, but i don't like
that part ;-).....

thanks again,

  Like so:

    class InnerSpaceRealm:
        __implements__ = portal.IRealm

        def __init__(self, service):
            self.service = service

        def requestAvatar(self, avatarId, mind, *interfaces):
            ...

  ;)  There are other ways, but I'm sure you don't need me to point them
out.  The key is, just do the obvious thing here.  There's no special way to
manage this.

You'd need to start the Twisted event loop up on each HTTP request.
Or... kinda. It's possible anyway, but you'll need to investigate
mod_python's interpreter lifetime model.

Finger is trivial. It asks a remote server for info about a user.

E.g. "finger foo at example.com" at a unix command line will ask
example.com, using the finger protocol, for foo's info, whatever that
is. Typically a finger server will return contents of the file ".plan"
from the user's home directory.

I might add that this is exactly the reason that Realm is an interface 
and not a class.  Considering that "session logic container" has 
infinite variability in its implementation, the restrictions on how a 
Realm has to work are _really_ light.

That means threaded programs with cfreactor will be really slow.

I think the issue is that the unix waker uses python sockets. You
probably want to write your own waker using whatever APIs you are using.

While we're at it - warner, could we have the mac os x reactor also run
tests with cfreactor?

It's theoretically possible, but almost certainly a bad idea.  Do you 
already have a large mod_python-using codebase?

If not, Twisted includes HTTP support for a reason.  Just use it :).  To 
communicate with your apache server, use mod_proxy or something similar 
to just relay requests to the Twisted web server.

If you do have a large mod_python-using application already and you are 
trying to get it to talk to Twisted, you probably want to continue to 
use the mod_python execution model rather than spin up the twisted event 
loop and switch back and forth: while it's possible if you really need 
it, a better architectural strategy in the average case (to avoid odd 
interactions between the assumptions mod_python has about its 
environment and the assumptions twisted has about its) would be to use 
Twisted's XMLRPC support and talk to it using a blocking XMLRPC library 
from your mod_python scripts.

I don't know what the deal is, exactly, because it uses python sockets 
internally and that works perfectly fine.  I believe that something 
about the waker causes the run loop to think that it's always awake.  I 
didn't feel like looking too far into it.  That said, Apple's 
implementation of CFRunLoop does everything that the reactor does (and 
then some), including thread waking and other thread communication 
facilities.. so when I have more time I'll look into the cause and the 
appropriate solution.    IIRC the only part of Twisted that uses 
threads on its own is the DB stuff, anything else would probably be 
implemented using more native means (nobody uses cfreactor for 
cross-platform applications yet), so I don't see an immediate problem 
with ignoring the waker.  I'd rather punish threaded (from what Twisted 
sees) applications than make all applications really really slow and 
resource hungry.

Others have already said that the right way is to "push, not pull":
give the service object as an argument to __init__.
I wanted to add that the correct way to pass the registry to
UserPerspective is probably much the same thing:

class UserPerspective:
    # ...
    def setRegistry(self, registry):
        self.registry = registry

class InnerSpaceRealm:
    __implements__ = portal.IRealm
    def __init__(self, registry):
        self.registry = registry

    def requestAvatar(self, avatarId, mind, *interfaces):
        if pb.IPerspective in interfaces:
            avatar = UserPerspective(mind, self.registry.get(avatarId))
            avatar.setRegistry(self.registry)
            return pb.IPerspective, avatar, avatar.logout
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError("no interface")

If there are better thread communication facilities in the CFRunLoop, 
then make your reactor's call[From/In]Thread use them.  There's nothing 
intrinsically useful about the waker; it's an implementation detail of 
callFromThread which could be better done in another way.

However, "really slow" doesn't quite describe the problem.  A server 
which sends an event to a thread without a waker and then receives a 
callFromThread may never wake up, if there isn't more network activity 
happening.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Twisted/sandbox/moonfallen/tap2ntsvc.py

If you have an Twisted application that you want to make into a service
on Windows, give this a try.  It's very basic right now; it absolutely
needs py2exe and Inno setup support before I'll consider it done.  The
goal is to have the output be a complete binary package analogous to the
output of tap2deb or tap2rpm.  The only difference will be that, instead
of depending on software like the Linux versions do, it will do as much
as it can to help you include the dependencies in the package using py2exe.

Right now, nothing beyond generating a service script is done.  Here's
the help:

Usage: tap2ntsvc.py [options] <filename>
Options:
~  -y, --type=          Config file type: pickle, xml, source, or python
~  -o, --output-file=   Name of the setup executable produced
~  -n, --name=          Short name of the service (used with "net start")
~  -d, --display-name=  Human-readable name of the service
~  -e, --description=   Description of the service
~  -r, --reactor=       Reactor to install (like twistd) [default: default]
~      --version
~      --help           Display this help and exit.

Do something like . . .

| python tap2ntsvc.py myapp.tac

The output is myappsvc.py (or <name>svc.py).  Then you run myappsvc.py:

| python myappsvc.py install
Installing service myapp to Python class
C:\myapp\myappsvc.myapp_ServiceControl
Changing service configuration
Service updated

| net start myapp
The myapp run by Twisted service is starting.
The myapp run by Twisted service was started successfully.


Give it a try, let me know if you have any problems with it.

Thanks,

Oh, does that work now? If I recall, that used to hang the buildslave.

I'll give it a try and turn on a cfreactor pass if it works.

My tests failed:

24:buildbot at quartz% python2.2 bin/trial -to -r cf twisted.test
...
  File "/Users/buildbot/Buildbot/slave/OSX-full2.2/Twisted/twisted/internet/cfreactor.py", line 42, in ?
    import cfsupport as cf
ImportError: Failure linking new module


It might be related to the following warning during the compilation phase:

 gcc -arch ppc -bundle -flat_namespace -undefined suppress build/temp.darwin-6.8-Power Macintosh-2.2/cfsupport.o -o twisted/internet/cfsupport.so -framework CoreFoundation -framework CoreServices -framework Carbon
 ld: warning dynamic shared library: /usr/lib/libSystem.dylib not made a weak library in output with MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable set to: 10.1


It doesn't hang, so I'm going to turn on the test anyway (it will just fail
all the time). I don't know a lot about OS-X linker magic.. somebody else
will have to figure out the problem here.

Hi,

we would like to propose to a customer of our a solution based on 
Twisted Names. The customer is open to this suggestion, but asked us if 
we could provide references of companies using Twisted Names in production?
If you know of companies we can mention (Name and size of the company, 
ev. contact person) it would help us a lot.

Thanks in advance,

I will not EVER support that version of Python 2.2.  You'll need to use  
python2.3 ( http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython/index.html ) or  
upgrade the machine to OS X 10.3.  If it works under that version of  
python, it's purely by chance.

And we do want a 2.2.0 buildbot going, since that's useful, and lets us
test OS X 10.2's python. Run another buildbot I guess?

Yep, a reactor without a waker is essentially broken. It'll also break
the SIGCHILD handler in CVS. Please do try to find a solution before our
next release.

Signals need a whole different approach because signals do not wake up 
CFRunLoop, so when you install handlers it wakes up once a second 
anyway.  The correct solution is to use a mach port waker for signals, 
I have not implemented this yet because there are no mach port 
facilities available from Python yet (I looked into it, but doing mach 
ports use a lot of C macros, so it would be hard).

When is next release planned?

I should add that, if you do have any problems using it (e.g. net start
doesn't work), check the Application Log in Event Viewer.  There should be a
helpful traceback in an Error event.

so i followed jp's advice, and my makeService method now looks like this:


###############code#################
def makeService(config):
    registry = Registry()
    reg_service = RegistryService(registry)
    portal = Portal(auth.InnerSpaceRealm(reg_service))
    checker = auth.RegistryChecker(registry)

    pb_service = internet.TCPServer(int(config['port']),

    reg_service.setServiceParent(pb_service)
    return pb_service
###############code#################


when i try to build my tap file now, i get


###############traceback#################

###############traceback#################


i've tried this both ways, with pb_service as the parent, and with
reg_service as the parent, with the same result.

btw, i am working out of a freshly checked-out cvs directory, but i doubt
that matters.

thanks again for any help,

i needed to have my parent class subclass MultiService, right? so i tried
this, and the tap built fine...hopefully it was the right thing (still
testing)...

One problem I had with a python windows service in general ended up being
related to the following tech note.  Took me forever to figure out what
the problem was, but every one of the symptoms in the tech note applied. 
I'm posting this to hopefully save other's the headache.

The immediate output you see is as follows:

E:\scripts>winsvc.py start
Starting service RatControlService
Error starting service: The service did not respond to the start or
control request in a timely fashion.
E:\scripts>

More info was available in the event logs as described in the tech note.

Message-ID: <02f901c3a99a$4eef28e0$8209500a@jsbwxp3>

Hi, I just installed twisted python on my Windows XP laptop which has Python 2.3.2.

I went to install it on Windows 2000 Professional version 5.00.2195 Service Pack 4 running Python 2.3 and got the following dialog box diagnostic: "Setup: CreateFile failed; code 5. Access is denied." I've been able to install piles of stuff on this system before, so I figure I have the required administrative privileges. I logon to a Windows domain, and my ID is in the Administrators group of the domain. There is a separate Administrator logon local to the machine which I haven't used, and probably can't get the password for, since this is a managed PC within the domain.

Here are my questions:

1) What does the "code 5" failure mean?

2) What am I doing wrong?

3) Can I just move the twisted site-package folders over from my XP system Python 2.3 folder to the corresponding Windows 2000 Pro folder? I'm mostly interested in just importing the twisted modules and prototyping; I can do without the icons and start menu entries.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] SSL.SysCallError in doRead
Message-ID: <20031113194552.GA26576@psychlaw.com.au>

Hi,

I noted the following exception while running some msn related
code earlier:

2003/11/14 05:09 EST [PassportLogin,client] Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "/home/sam/Twisted/twisted/python/log.py", line 65, in callWithLogger
            callWithContext({"system": lp}, func, *args, **kw)
          File "/home/sam/Twisted/twisted/python/log.py", line 52, in callWithContext
            return context.call({ILogContext: newCtx}, func, *args, **kw)
          File "/home/sam/Twisted/twisted/python/context.py", line 32, in callWithContext
            return func(*args,**kw)
          File "/home/sam/Twisted/twisted/internet/default.py", line 513, in _doReadOrWrite
            why = getattr(selectable, method)()
        --- <exception caught here> ---
          File "/home/sam/Twisted/twisted/internet/tcp.py", line 98, in doRead
            return Connection.doRead(self)
          File "/home/sam/Twisted/twisted/internet/tcp.py", line 234, in doRead
            data = self.socket.recv(self.bufferSize)
        SSL.SysCallError: (104, 'Connection reset by peer')

On closer inspection it seems that the surrounding try/except clause only
cares about SSL.SysCallErrors which pertain to unexpected EOF and all others
are re-raised. The only reason I can come up with for why this is the case is
that it was not anticipated that other exceptions (like the one above) could
arise from the given recv call. I would expect that in the above instance,
connectionLost should be called, but it may very well be that i'm missing some
subtlety so I am yet to submit a bug report.

Cheers,

Sam.

What is important here is if you or the group you are member of in the
domain has administrative privileges on the local machine. Check out
computer managment (or whatever) and see which users/groups are
members of the adminstrators group on the local machine (not the
domain admins).

  In tcp.py, on line 114, this exception is being caught and logged, then
CONNECTION_LOST is being returned, which should cause all the appropriate
lost-connection-callbacks to be invoked.

  The error is logged just to err on the side of being overly informative. 
It shouldn't interfere with connectionLost or clientConnectionLost.  If it
is, please do file a bug report.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] LivePage CACHING Problem
Message-ID: <20031113163859.5A293415FE@server1.messagingengine.com>

Hi,

I am currently trying to use LivePage to update the cells of an html
table with results from processes initiated in various PB services.  The
client intiates requests in the services and those services call back
into the client's (a pb.Referenceable) remote_updateStatus method to
update the table which displays the results.  I have test code that
simulates this and everything works fine.  Javascript is sent to the
browser to update the cells of the table.  Works really slick.  However,
now that I tried to hook it up to PB, the LivePage javascript sending
part isn't working.  When I make the page.sendScript(script) call I get
the following in the log.

2003/11/13 10:25 CST [Broker,client] Sending javascript to page
<twisted.web.woven.utils.WovenLivePage instance at 0x4089944c>
2003/11/13 10:25 CST [Broker,client] CACHING
[<twisted.web.woven.utils.Script instance at 0x4089906c>]

All future sendScript calls append the script to the cache.  Everything
else is working appropriately, and all code is executing as I'd expect,
except that the javascript doesn't send properly.  Is there something in
particular I should be looking for here?  I don't see what I'm doing
different, but since LivePage is quite magical to me I'm not sure where
to look.

On a slightly different note, is there LivePage-ish support in nevow, and
do you recommend moving to that yet?

Thanks.
-Justin

Last question (sry, I'm still a newbie in twisted :p) :
where do I put my blocking code ? just before the defer.succeed ??

I found the following post that looks similar to my problem.

I'm sure this has been answered a million times before, but here goes...

Deferreds do not magically turn blocking code into non-blocking code. If
you place blocking code in a wmfactory_ method, it will still interfere
with the event loop.

If you have blocking code, you can either rewrite it in a non-blocking
manner, or you can use a separate thread to run it.
<http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/threading>

If you give more detail about what you're trying to do, I'm sure one of
the Twisted gurus can explain what the best approach(es) might be.

I'm sure too. But I proposed a long time ago (and several times) to use
a forum instead of a mailing list...

I thought of using the setUp method of page. I can start the calculation
when the page loads, but I don't know what to call (in the callback)
when it's done (a wmfactory_xxx ?). I'll check the threading part you
gave me. Thank you !

This is a terrible excuse. Not only do we have our *own* archives:

http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python 

which, of course, are searchable via google: 

"deferred blocking code site:twistedmatrix.com"

there are *multiple* archives elsewhere that have a built-in search
functionality as well:

http://marc.free.net.ph/list/twisted-python.html

http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.twisted

I found these with a trivial amount of googling: "twisted-python
mailing list"

Having searchable archives is obviously no reason to switch to a web
forum (ugh), as we have that right now.

Unfortunately, I don't think there's any special support in Woven to
handle Deferreds from setUp. You can return Deferreds from
wmfactory_XXX and Woven will handle them correctly: it will not finish
rendering the page until that Deferred has fired and the model is
ready.

Hi 

the doc string of adbapi.Augmentation mentions just using the ConnectionPool 
directly.

"A class which augments a database connector with some functionality.
This class is now deprecated. Just use the ConnectionPool directly.
Conventional usage of me is to write methods that look like..."


Presumbably this means DONT inherit from ConnectionPool like you
used to inherit from Augmentation( or am I reading that incorrectly)
and just create a ConnectionPool instance and run the queries through that.

But I think it works okay to subclass ConnectionPool ...
at least, it works for me.  Is there a better way to
do something like the following (which is working fine)?

Sure, there's no particular reason that subclassing ConnectionPool
can't be done, but the only difference is that you're using methods
like "self.runQuery" instead of "self.db.runQuery" (after doing
"self.db = ConnectionPool(etc)". I probably wouldn't subclass unless I
actually wanted to override one of the methods in ConnectionPool with
a modified implementation and then use it in the same place that a
regular ConnectionPool is expected.

I'm sure too. But I proposed a long time ago (and several times) to use a

I thought of using the setUp method of page. I can start the calculation
when the page loads, but I don't know what to call (in the callback) when
it's done (a wmfactory_xxx ?). I'll check the threading part you gave me.
Thank you !

Well, on the other hand I wouldn't be reading that anymore. A mailinglist has 
the advantage that it comes to you. I think the likelyness of getting an 
answer is much higher with a mailinglist. To be honest I don't think that 
storing the stuff in a forum will make the FAQ's disappear. People just don't 
search thru the forum, pretty much the same as they don't read FAQ's and 
search mailinglist-archives.

The problem with a forum is that you have to physically go and look to 
see if anything has been posted.
I like forums and have been involved in a number over the years, however 
once the workload increases I tend to find it harder and harder to find 
time to visit and eventually stop visiting altogether. My mail however, 
I always read as it's there *in your face* so to speak.
I'm lazy like that :o)

To address your main points:

- Topics can be nicely seperated
Thats what threading is for, if your mail client does not support it 
then there are many out there that do (I use Thunderbird).

- Past knowledge can be easily searched.
I can easily search through the emails I have from the past, plus 
there's always the archive (URL given in a previous post).

- Email inboxes can be freed from much clutter
Ok, I'll give you that one - although I don't class it as clutter! A 
bunch of mail filters and a handy mbox archiving
script (written in python I might add) keep my system nice and tidy :o)

/me goes back to lurking

This is pointless. If you don't want to subscribe to the mailing list,
don't: just use one of the web interfaces to it that I pointed out
earlier.

If you want to post to the mailing list without requiring moderation,
and you want to read messages through the web and NOT receive them
through the mail, then subscribe and set the "nomail" option on your
account.

Being new to twisted I may be lacking a clue, but finding the
proper arguments to twisted.application.internet.UDPServer()
was a major pain in the butt.  

Only by looking at the code could I find all the valid arguments and
that took a lot of tracing because the valid arguments are determined by
listenudp() it seems.

Is their an easier way or is it always frustrating to determine the
acceptable arguments to an init function? 

Thanks,

Almost correct.
The idiomatic way is

class SomeOtherService
    # .... do something interesting here
    def registry(self):
        return self.parent.getServiceNamed('registry')

def makeService(config):
    s = RegistryService()
    s.setName('registry')
    anotherS = SomeOtherService()
    m = service.MultiService()
    s.setServiceParent(m)
    anotherS.setServiceParent(m)
    return m

The trick is to have 's' and 'anotherS' completely symmetrical,
and allow them to access each other.

Everything else Jp said, including the part about "globals bad,
explicit references good" has my whole-hearted blessing.

As Mr. Armstrong just explaned, you can do all this and more with
the existing mailing list archive. It's here:

http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python
 
You don't need to be subscried to the list to read the archive. Topics
are nicely seperated. Posts can be easily searched using google. Is it
too late to use the tools we already have before dumping 'em for a
bulletin board? Hm?

And, of course, the mailing list isn't the only source of documentation.
The official docs are far from perfect, but they're getting better (over 300
pages as a PDF, when I last checked!).

For cases like this question, there's the FAQ.  I've just checked in an
addition to it that hopefully addresses this question.  It should be visible
here in a few minutes, once buildbot does its thing:

Well, others (and elsewhere, myself) have given the reasons that the 
labs won't host a forum, but I think it would be great if someone else 
would do so.  I've said before that the Twisted community needs more 
than one medium for communication, it seems that enough people here 
have a preference for forum software that it's viable to set one up.

Please send me a link to put on the tm.com site when you do so.

This is a terrible excuse. Not only do we have our *own* archives:

http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python 

which, of course, are searchable via google: 

"deferred blocking code site:twistedmatrix.com"

there are *multiple* archives elsewhere that have a built-in search
functionality as well:

http://marc.free.net.ph/list/twisted-python.html

http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.twisted

I found these with a trivial amount of googling: "twisted-python mailing
list"

Having searchable archives is obviously no reason to switch to a web forum
(ugh), as we have that right now.

Unfortunately, I don't think there's any special support in Woven to handle
Deferreds from setUp. You can return Deferreds from wmfactory_XXX and Woven
will handle them correctly: it will not finish rendering the page until that
Deferred has fired and the model is ready.

i absolutely agree with all of your points. i don't have the hatred of
web-based interfaces that you guys seem to ;-), but i think that there is
definitely a bit of elitism coming into play.

we (as proud geeks) know all the google tricks and mailman preferences to
get things to behave as we like them to. but let's face it, there's more
to gaining "acceptance" or "market share", or whatever you want to call
it, than appealing to the developers.

obviously, that is the level twisted is at now, and i agree the need for a
forum is limited at this point. but for example, pretty soon (in the
scheme of things) people are going to want to tell their bosses about
twisted. many of you seem to be fortunate to have (or be) bosses who are
willing to take a chance on a new framework. however, to clue in the PHBs
that so many of us have making decisions, a centralized, "user-friendly",
web-based forum could be much more accessible.

and there's more than pointy-haired-bosses who could benefit from this,
such as the beginning web developer/administrator who may not think on the
same level, but could really make use of an apache alternative. i'm sure
you're all familiar with the state of IT in businesses today; many a
webmaster is lucky to be able to, forgive the expression, walk and chew
gum at the same time.

i think the biggest reason it might be worth investigating is because as
much as twisted is progressing as a project, i can see it forming a
community of developers willing to, again, please forgive the cliche,
"think outside the box." i have seen mind-blowing levels of genius come
out of this group, so much so that i once made the statement to glyph, "i
want to help, but i feel like i'm just a programmer, and all you guys are
computer scientists."

i know what you mean about using the tools that are already available, but
i think that as twisted grows, if you want the more user-oriented (as in,
non-developer-oriented) parts to be accessible, a more user-oriented
approach might be helpful.

anyways, what it comes down to is this. i've been looking for a reason to
set up this forum software i'm really fond of on my machine, but i haven't
had a reason to do so yet. i'm going to go ahead and give it a try, and
you can check it out and see if you want to bother with it or not. if not,
no big deal, and if it seems interesting and not painful to use, then we
can investigate it further...

Not to further muddy the waters, but one reason I've been looking at 
Twisted was to port the software I wrote for Zope that runs at 
http://z.iwethey.org/forums -- we also have a hosting service. If you 
care to look around the site, the software gets extremely good reviews 
from the users with respect to the interface. It has full text indexing 
as well. With Twisted running behind it, I plan on integrating the 
forums with Jabber chat rooms, irc, and email.

I won't be porting it for at least a month or so, however (new baby in 
the house), but I fully intend on completing the project when I get the 
time.

Regards,
-scott

Did you try using help(internet.UDPServer) from the interactive interpreter?
Here's what I got:

class UDPServer(_AbstractServer)
 |  Serve UDP clients
 |
 |  Call listenUDP when the service starts, with the
 |  arguments given to the constructor. When the service stops,
 |  stop listening.

I checked in a fix to make it say "reactor.listenUDP" -- I guess it was
just a blindspot of me, I knew what listenUDP means :)
Anyway, this should not have required any "looking at the code".
Hopefully with my fix you'll be able to know you should do
help(reactor.listenUDP) to get the information you're after:

>>> help(reactor.listenUDP)
Help on method listenUDP in module twisted.internet.default:

listenUDP(self, port, protocol, interface='', maxPacketSize=8192) method of twis
ted.internet.default.SelectReactor instance
    Connects a given L{DatagramProtocol} to the given numeric UDP port.

I realize that the indirection is a pain, but it'd be somewhat annoying
(not impossible, though) to lose it, and I would prefer not to do it
unless it's a real deal breaker for someone.

In general, I highly recommend using help() from the interactive interpreter
to read the docstrings of stuff, and see how to call it. If this strategy
does not give you information for a specific method/class, you should
file a documentation bug in http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs -- while
ideally everything should have a docstring, the developers have so much
time, so prioritizing by stuff people need is a necessity.

You can always start using Stani's Python Editor SPE ( 
http://spe.pycs.net/ ) which automagically shows you the docstring and 
required parameterlist. ;-)

And with IPython it's even simpler, e.g. "help reactor.listenUDP".  
IPython does the parens for you, allowing for new heights of laziness. :)

If the docstrings aren't enough and you want to see the source after all, 
"psource reactor.listenUDP" shows you the source for just that single 
function, in pretty colors, even.

And you can't beat the tab completion: "reactor.listen<TAB>" shows you 
lots of interesting things.

Sure, it's slow to load, but IPython takes the interactive Python 
experience to a whole new level, especially in situations like this where 
you're exploring new (to you) code.

Oh yeah, try the @pdb option, which automatically launches the debugger 
*at the point of failure* when an uncaught exception occurs.  Alas, since 
the reactor catches all exceptions, this won't help much with Twisted apps.

I too love ipython :)  Especially since the deep reload command works 
fairly well.  Has macros too.  You can access the lines that you type in 
as a list.  Which makes getting a copy of code you type in there 
easier.  Oh and you can use !ls for shell commands.  More features at 
the website:

Have fun!

The question is not to use the ML OR the forum, but both of them. While
the Ml could be more "dev" oriented, the forum would help newbies to
find answers quicker than in the mailing list. Forums.gentoo.org and
gentoo-user or gentoo-dev mailings lists are a good exemple (there an
irc channel too). Forums.gentoo.org are very popular with their features
(categorize information, advanced search + highlight words, answers are
notified by mail, etc.).

I know Glyph don't want to hear about phpBB, because it's not written
using python&twisted. So, what's the solution ? Create a brand new forum
system using twisted ? Volonteers ? Roundup is quite good, and show the
right road. Twisted needs some killer apps.

I'm trying to manage my gentoo box with a twisted server (A linux
Distro). Portage is very slow, and build the package first level tree
can take several seconds. I just wanted my page not to block while
loading, and put the result in it when it becomes available.

The list of the category is in a "wmupdate_category(self, request)"
method, in which I'd like to use deferreds.

Thank you gurus for your help !

If you want to use phpbb I doubt anyone will boycott it. Again, anyone
who wants to can setup a forum. Roundup is not a twisted product, it's a
CGI.

Matthew,

A forum does not solve the core issue of organizing information
into a clear hierarchy of topics, filtering relevant questions
and answers, and a whole host of other items.  While a Wiki or
a Forum could be useful, it will only work if there are several
people who care about its structure, moderate it, and work
hard to make the information useful.   Other than that, threaded
email works just as well.  

IMHO, an AutoFAQ would be more appropriate, in particular, if you
or someone else dedicates significant _time_ to make sure that it
stays orderly and useful.   Sort of a AutoFAQ, you could simply
implement or edit a FAQ.  I'm sure if you kept one up-to-date 
it would glady find its way into the source code.

Probably a more "helpful" item would be a "Weekly Report" 
like the Python Developer's list has.  Some dutiful individual
there scans all of the things discussed, lists the topics
discussed, summarizes them into a single paragaraph and 
provides links to particularly insighful emails.  In my 
opinion, this would be far more useful..

I would love to see this happen! I used to do this waay back in the
day for Twisted, but I apparently don't have the focus to keep it up
(I only got 6 issues out). I would certainly *help* with such an
effort, now, as long as someone is willing to be responsible for it,
and can bug me when they need my help.

Here's an example of what I did, the 6th and final issue:

Yeah, that's a known glitch; the docs in the doc-latest directory aren't
generated with valid API links.  I've just checked in a change that will
make the doc-latest docs generate links to
    http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/TwistedDocs/current/...
which will fix the worst of the broken links (there are likely to still be
some, seeing as that is linking CVS howtos to the release version of the API
docs).

There's a seperate bug with the way links to top-level functions in modules
work (as opposed to classes and methods of classes) which means that
particular link will still not work for now.  It'll work when we do another
release, though, which is what matters.  doc-latest docs are just a preview
of the next release, after all, not the final product :)

Anyway, aside from that link, I take it you are happy with that FAQ entry? :)

-Andrew.

I liked those forums. Best of both worlds. It does have a slowness I attribute 
to Zope, and so on.

I liked the mixed threads/flat-view that the forum uses. This is good for real 
discussion. And also, it allows one to browse faster.

However, the CSS is IMHO lousy, and very unattractive. I think we could 
configure this better. If it is gets to be available on twisted, it would be 
good. However, I prefer to use lightweight systems; both in bandwidth and CPU. 
I hope this system is made to be scalable and accessible.

You should put up an example setup, clean the CSS to the bare minimums. Put up 
a minimum of forums. I would think: Development, Twisted, Web
Perhaps add: Issues (the workaround forum), Showroom (brag) and General 
Bullshit

This brings up a sore point yet again - we need a documentation editor.

I'm still willing to do this, as per the mail here:
http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2003-October/006114.html

The four weeks has passed too. I'm not sure whether you were looking for
someone who has previously been involved in Twisted development though.

I'll have a look at the documentation and see what I think of it I
guess (I haven't read all of Twisted's documentation).

Yes, there are issues with how the database drivers work. I have to run 
it in single threaded mode or we get problems like lock-ups and 
corruption. :-P

Meh. It's a prototype. One that does half a million hits a month, but a 
prototype nonetheless.

If you were browsing without logging in, keep in mind that you were 
doing full forum scans. When you're logged in and have "Show New Only" 
turned on, things speed up considerably.

The views are also configurable by user. The interface has been beaten 
on and dissected by scores of computer professionals for years, all of 
whom know Exactly What They Want. :-)

The CSS was written before I knew what CSS was, and yes, it could stand 
a lot of improvement. :-)

There's a user option to turn CSS off completely. One of the main design 
goals was to allow anyone to use the forums: they work just as well in 
something like lynx or w3m.

Moving to Twisted is a priority, given the performance.

I would say that's probably not a requirement ;-). If you need me to
do anything, commit patches, update the web site, or whatever, please
ask. I'll try to be around to help for this task, specifically :)

Beggars can't be choosers!  Plus, I think you've got just the right 
amount of involvement with Twisted development - you clearly understand 
what's going on, but you haven't drunk enough of the kool-aid yet to be 
unable to see other approaches and make comparisons to other 
technologies.

As a way of getting a handle on this task, can people mail me offlist
with their understanding of what the current burning issues with the
documentation are, and with wishlist documentation issues too? That
includes documents that aren't written and should be and documents that
are written that need rewriting, as well as overview problems
("documents are poorly indexed" that kind of thing). Specific is better
though...

This will give me a way to start a todo list (oh, if there already is a
doc todo list, can someone tell me where it is?) that would be
considerably faster than doing a initial full review of the docs myself.
In the meantime, I'll have a look at roundup and see what I can do about
using it to keep track of doc bugs/wishlist items (I don't know whether
this would overwhelm the bug tracker with documentation bugs).

I'll summarise for the list in about a week. If you'd prefer me not to
quote your email, please let me know, otherwise I'll assume people are
OK with their responses to this mail being quoted.

I'm a fairly pedantic, obsessive-compulsive freak when it comes to
grammar and spelling freak, but we have had some conflicts regarding
that in the past...

I prefer to use the 'nomail' option to the mailing list (so i can post) 
and use gmane's nntp via mozilla thunderbird to read.  The web interface 
also allows for dearching posts.  Keeps my inbox from getting too 
cluttered, but I have easy access to all of the mailing list (even from 
before I signed up to it) in a nice threaded format.

I am trying to select some data from a database in hopes of eventually using
it to populate a dynamic page.  Before I dive into woven, I was trying to
get the following to print selected data directly to a html resource using
the following code snippet (or various versions of it).   I've only been
able to get an empty page though ( <html><body></body></html> ).  I'm
wondering if maybe the request is getting returned before the callback makes
it to the defer?  Any ideas? Thanks in advance,

dbpool = adbapi.ConnectionPool(<connection stuff>)

def getData(data):
    return dbpool.runQuery("SELECT * FROM some_table WHERE some_column =
%s", data)

def printResult(data, request):
    request.write("pre-data")
    request.write(data)
    request.write("post-data")
    request.finish()

Are you sure your code is even being triggered? Since your code isn't
writing out those HTML tags anywhere, it seems like some completely
different resource is being renderred instead of yours. Can you put
some debug prints in "render" and "printResult"?

Also, Mozilla and IE I think both will say "<html><body></body></html>" even
when nothing was sent.  Try testing with telnet or wget...

Yes, I think Mozilla is the source for the "<html><body></body></html>"
string.  I don't think anything is being sent.  If I put a request.finish()
in "render" then the resource returns any data written to request in
"render" (but not "printResult").  I'm guessing that the connection with the
client gets closed before a request is rendered.

Is anyone aware of any examples of web applications written in twisted that
uses a database to store dynamic elements?  Thats ultimately where I'm
trying to get with this.  Thanks for the responses.

-Charles.

I added some print debug statements as follows:

def printResult(data, request):
    print "entered printResult"
    request.write("pre-data")
    request.write(data)
    request.write("post-data")
    request.finish()
    print request
    return server.NOT_DONE_YET

class myResource(resource.Resource):
    def render(self, request):
        print "entered render"
        d = getData("some string")
        d.addCallback(printResult, request)
        print "after callback"
        return server.NOT_DONE_YET

resource = myResource()

which results in the following logs being generated:

2003/11/15 19:49 PST [HTTPChannel,13,<ip>] entered render
2003/11/15 19:49 PST [HTTPChannel,13,<ip>] after callback

What is 'data' here? can you print repr(data)? It might be the empty
string, or something.

This is unnecessary here, FYI.

2003/11/15 20:43 PST [-] entered printResult
2003/11/15 20:43 PST [-] ((13L, 'Hawaii', 'HI', 'US'),)

Seems like the request might be different from the original, or doesn't have
a channel to respond on?

For completeness, Christopher pointed out that I was not passing a string to
request.write (str(data)).  Since I did not have an Errback call, the
exception that was raised in the callback was never output.  (fixed by
adding: d.addErrback(log.err)  )

Thanks for the help!

Thanks for your helpful reply.  I had looked at the web documentation
and interactive help however I evidently have a blind spot for the very
first sentence. :)  I repeatedly skimmed down to the function I am interested
in and saw:

__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)

Not being able to find out what these arguments were *right there* in the
documentation I immediately just checked the code.  This didn't take
long at all of course just annoying.  I then ran into the same issue
with one of the other server classes and figured I must be missing
something.  Turns out I was evidently literally missing something 
in the documentation.  :)

So far though Twisted is a great system.  Thanks for your work and
reply.

Philipp,
thanks for your info and efforts.

I am currently working on a Project using Plone 2.0 for which I need a visual 
editor.
Since the project is due by the end of the year, I need to use a solution that 
is available by then. 
My question therefore is:what is the state of the plone integration?
Is there something I could use to start with?

I would very much like to help beta testing, but it must be in an Plone 
environment.

Robert

Subject: [Twisted-Python] LivePage patch? - was (LivePage CACHING Problem)
Message-ID: <20031117191929.B0D6141510@server1.messagingengine.com>

Working with fzZzy on #divmod, I made the following change to my local
twisted/web/woven/flashconduit.py to make LivePage work for me.  I'm
using guard sessions (which appear to not be supported by the current
code) so in my case the sessions are stored on the SessionWrapper.  I
really don't know squat about the way the code should be, so hopefully
someone else can take a look at this and apply a real patch.  I'd gladly
do the real thing, but it would take me a *lot* longer to do.  :-)

Thanks.
-Justin

I found the following post that looks similar to my problem.

http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2003-May/004170.html

But since I have my own tap, I copied the code from web/tap.py into my
code to start up the FlashConduitFactory.  It starts up, but I get the
following errors.  Is this a bug?  Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] model question
Message-ID: <000001c3ad43$3cdf7f40$687ba8c0@vicky>

I have a web based application.
 
I want to create a model from a sql query that will be accessible from
the web page.
I want to be able to create my model in the setUp fonction.
I also want to access my model from the web page like this:
model="plan_id" (where plan_id is a column from my sql query)
 
I don't know if someone understand what I want.
 
Here's a part of my class:
 
class SummaryDB:
    """PublisherDB Class"""
    def __init__(self, dbpool):
        self.dbpool = dbpool
 
    def getSummary(self, plan_id):
        sql = "select * from plan where plan_id = '%s'" %plan_id
        return self.dbpool.runQueryDict(sql)
 
class SummaryPage(pages.BasePage):
    templateFile = "summary.html"
    
    def initialize(self, dbpool):
        self.dbpool = dbpool
        self.db = SummaryDB(self.dbpool)
            
    def setUp(self, request, *args):
        # I want to do somethings like :
        # self.model = ({'details' : self.db.getSummary(plan_id)}
        # and then, access to details by my web page
        self.contextMenu = menus.build_search_menu()
 
    
And here's my template:
 
<html>
            <head>
                        <title>
                                    Title

            </head>
            <body>

                                    <tr>

                                    <tr>
                                                <td class="label"

                                                            Number 
                                                </td>

Why don't you use a wmfactory_details ?
I don't understand why you want to put it in the setUp method :(

this is actually the first time i've ever written a PB client in python.
since my java client was calling the remote methods out of the awt/swing
event thread, i never had to deal with this particular issue. while i'm
waiting for the update to the java pb packages (*cough*itamar*cough* ;-)
), i figured it would be worthwhile to do up a text-based client in
python.

i know this relates to my poor understanding of deferreds, but i just
can't figure out exactly how to go about doing what i want to do.

i want to be able to continually prompt the user for a string that gets
sent to a "parse" method on the remote object. i'm not exactly sure the
right way to do this. do I just add a callback to the deferred returned by

def main():
    config = Options()
    if(config['login'] == None):
        config['login'] = getpass.getuser()
    passwd = getpass.getpass("%s@%s's password: " % (config['login'],

Calling raw_input is a bad idea.  It will block.

You should either use twisted.internet.stdio (which is probably more work
than you care to do -- but see doc/examples/cursesclient.py for an example
that uses stdio and curses to make a simple irc client), or run raw_input in
a thread:


from twisted.internet import threads

def connected(perspective):
    deferred = threads.deferToThread(raw_input, "> ")
    deferred.addCallback(lambda cmd: perspective.callRemote("parse", cmd))
    deferred.addCallback(lambda res: connected(perspective))


Note that perspective.callRemote will return a Deferred -- but that's ok,
the Deferreds automatically cope with (i.e. wait for) deferred results from
callbacks :)

Something else to notice is that Deferreds pass the result of the previous
callback (or the original result, for the first callback) to each callback,
which is why I wrote:
    deferred.addCallback(lambda res: connected(perspective))
rather than your:
    defer.addCallback(connected)

Message-ID: <6.0.0.22.0.20031118114909.01e82730@anusf.anu.edu.au>

Hi all,

I probably shouldn't be too surprised, but I'm experiencing
some odd behaviour with IE 6.0 .vs. Mozilla 1.5, both on
Windows XP.

I've developed a Woven application that generates three
HTML pages, let's call them A, B, and C.

A's render() method does a redirect to B. B's view methods
generate an XHTML meta tag with the content attribute set
to a refresh and new URL for C:

     <meta content="10;http://example.org/C" http-equiv="refresh" />

With Mozilla as the client everything thing goes as I expected
with pages progressing from A to B to C.

With IE as the client it goes from A to B, then loops continually
on B, i.e A, B, B, B, ... without ever reaching C.

I suspect there's some request header I need to set or set
differently?  Can anyone offer me advice on this strange
situation?


Cheers,

Stu

In my application I have a server that listens on a UNIX socket.
When I kill the application, the socket file remains in the filesystem
so  when  I  restart  it  I always achieve an "Address already in use"
error.

Should  I  delete  it  manually  any time I stop the application or is
there a more elegant way to solve this problem?

The application is a plugin for twistd.

Thank you in advance.

I'm guessing you're using 1.1?
It's fixed in CVS, so when there is a new release, it will be fixed.
I'm not sure what your best course of action, though:
* Live with it, and wait for new release
* Move to CVS, wait for new release to move back to released version
* Implement some work around, wait for new release to remove it

I'm sorry there aren't better news than "it was a bug, we fixed it" --
twisted.application is quite a bit of code, and testing in the field
frequently finds more bugs. You can rest assured that the bug was
not merely fixed, but a unit test added to make sure it doesn't
come back.

I will take option number 1.
If I'm not wrong, in version 1.0.7 this error didn't appear.

That's good, thank you: I will wait for next release.

That sounds likely.  twisted.application, and the associated changes to
twistd and other infrastructure, were new to 1.1.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] win32eventreactor bug?
Message-ID: <20031118151402.43857400DF@server1.messagingengine.com>

I was running twistd on windows, serving out a custom tap which is just a
web app and a pb service.  As it was doing it's thing, suddenly a ton of
output started dumping on the log.  Did I find a bug in the win32 event
reactor, or am I hitting some sort of limit?  I can send some code along
if necessary, but nothing in the log looks specific to my code.

Thanks.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] new ftp implementation
Message-ID: <3FBA5F25.4070506@twistedmatrix.com>

Hello all,

Just wanted to announce there is a new version of the ftp server/protocol.

the new protocol:

   - Supports cred, so you can control/abstract the filesystem
   - includes an anonymous-only avatar/realm
   - supports pipelining of commands
   - intentionally does not support globbing (to help prevent security
     holes)
   - connection limiting (ex. max 100 users)
   - individual timeouts for protocol interpreter idle time and dtp
     connection times

todos:
   - the permissions-checking needs improvement. I intend to set up an
     option on the FTPFactory that will let you set the uid of the
     anonymous user, but that's coming in the next week.
   - path purification code needs improvement (to prevent intentionally 	
     stupid paths like "\\//*/*/../../*/.." from borking the server)
   - a couple of other minor odds-and-ends


there's an example tac file in sandbox/slyphon/ftp_refactor/ftpsrv.tac

comments, suggestions, etc. welcomed

one more note, as of right now, the avatar i've implemented will only 
work on linux/unix (specifically platforms that support python's pwd and 
grp modules). patches for win32 would be greatly appreciated! :)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] SOAP client for Twisted
Message-ID: <20031118152003.A985@cutter.rexx.com>

I've added minimal SOAP client support to Twisted.

I did it by copying a bit of code from twisted/web/xmlrpc.py and by
using some of the functionality from SOAPpy and adding it to
twisted/web/soap.py.

I've tested it lightly and it seems to work.

Is this of interest to the Twisted project?

If so, let me know and I'll send it along.

Someone who knows Twisted better than I will have to look at the
code to make sure that, given the way I implemented it, it does not
block.

Yes indeed, please add a patch to

The win32eventreactor is limited to 64 objects, so that might be what's
causing the error.

OK, some results of this and later discussion is at
http://twistedmatrix.com/users/roundup.twistd/twisted/issue397

I've assigned a bunch of unclaimed doc bugs in the bug tracker to myself
(hypatia), and people can assign doc bugs to me if they like. I will try
and take responsibility at least for finding someone else to do them
otherwise they will go in what will probably turn out to be quite a long
list of docs to be written by me.

The first item I am likely to look at is an overall guide to the
documentation, probably with sub-topics ("multi-protocol applications
with Twisted", "web development with Twisted" and so on).

There's also a bit of demand for an overview of asynch network
programming and related docs on Deferreds assuming only the knowledge
given in such an overview. This is important but is not high on my own
todo list because I'm not an expert so if anyone wants to produce those
that would be excellent.

If you have comments, feel free to contact me on this list, by email
off-list, or on IRC, probably in that order of preference if you want me
to add stuff to a todo list (I'm terrible at using IRC as a todo list).

Message-ID: <3FBB5B27.5030809@brainbot.com>

Hi all,

I would like to integrate the PerspectiveBorker into a 
platform-independant GUI.
If I use Delphi for example, I include the twisted-reactor via the 
Python Deplhi Interface.
But then if I call "reactor.run()" this blocks the Delphi Application!
Since wxPython for is not supported for Windows yet, and I do not want 
to use GTK or PyGui, my question is:
How can I integrate the twisted framework into a GUI environment such as 
Delphi?
Or do I have to use Java?
Can I run the reactor in another thread?

regards,

Thorsten

work, but the latest twisted says, wxsupport is not fully supported on 
Windows.

ouch ! 

I haven't seen this demo, but I think it's quite old. try this instead :

http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/203471


(your warning came from twisted, not wxpython)

and here is the killing tip of the day :

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Retrieving Woven html element IDs
Message-ID: <20031119140646.D9D3941F48@server1.messagingengine.com>

In woven, html elements are automatically given an id (eg. <div
id="woven_id_18612312">... where the number is id(self) for the view).  I
have a div tag I'm trying to using to dump error logs into on the fly
with LivePage and display them to the user.  It seems that I cannot
reference a tag by name with javascript, so I need access to the
auto-generated id.  If I had the id I could do something similar to the
example below.

Does anyone know if it's possible to lookup this id in woven?

Thanks.

<html>

function displayErrors() {
    id = 'errors'
    document.getElementById(id).innerHTML += '<span>some

}
</script>

The best way to do it is to provide your own ID. When you add an id 
attribute to a
node, woven will refrain from overwriting it with an auto-generated one.

Did you try twisted.web.lmx or twisted.web.microdom ? These packages wil help
you to modify the dom tree. (lmx can modify the rendered tree, and  microdom 
the template tree, if i'm right).

You want to integrate the Delphi event loop with the Twisted event loop.
This will involve either a custom reactor, or something like what
twisted.internet.wxsupport or tksupport do.

  Cool.  The clock is an hour fast, it seems (or maybe it just doesn't know
about daylight savings time.  I could hardly blame it), and there are a
couple other minor annoyances (I really wanted to see my name as "last
registered user"!  Oh well, it's only PHP *wink*), but cool.

  I thought I might suggest some other sections to create, but I think I'll
just wait and see what people use it for.

It's also really slow (a few minutes) to send out that confirmation

Subject: [Twisted-Python] looking for twisted Tkinter documentation
Message-ID: <02f301c3aecf$cdb35090$a90a500a@jsbwxp3>

Hi, I found the following at
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/choosing-reactor#auto16:

-----
Tkinter
The support for Tkinter doesn't use a specialized reactor. Instead, there is
some specialized support code:
from Tkinter import *
from twisted.internet import tksupport

root = Tk()
root.withdraw()

# Install the Reactor support
tksupport.install(root)

An example Twisted application that uses Tk can be found in
twisted/words/ui/tkim.py.
-----

But I didn't find it in either the twisted or TwistedDocs directories in my
Python 2.3 site-packages directory. The copyright,.py on my twisted
installation shows twisted version 1.1.0.

I also had a look at the examples index in
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/examples/#auto8 and found links to uses
of qt, wx, gtk2 and curses, but nothing about Tkinter.

Having loaded up on Tkinter books on the strength of the assertion that
Tkinter is the standard, most cross-platform GUI for Python, I'm
understandably anxious to use it with twisted. I'm writing a socket server
that needs to both respond to incoming client requests and occasionally send
unsolicited messages to the client based on Tkinter button presses and timer
expirations.

I was originally going use some lower-level Python modules, but I was
intrigued by the stylistic and software engineering claims of twisted,
especially the use of aspect-oriented programming as a tool for managing
unrelated complexities, so I'm going to try to dive into twisted a little
deeper before giving up and heading back to the shallow end of the pool.
Thanks in advance for any information that will help me integrate Tkinter
with twisted.

P.S. I found the itamarst.org tutorials (formidavel!) and am working my way
through them.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Python a post-Object Oriented Language?
Message-ID: <035201c3aede$10464800$a90a500a@jsbwxp3>

Hi, I saw the above characterization in one of the itamarst.org twisted presentation slides. Although I'm just a journeyman programmer and somewhat unaccustomed to the rarefied atmosphere of many twisted Python discussions, I'm curious to hear why Python would be "post-OOP".

If I recall correctly, my little O'Reilly C++ book said that OOP meant you had 4 things (abstraction, encapsulation, hierarchy and something else that escapes me at the moment, maybe "coolness"). I also recall that compiled C++ had a hard time doing the neat tricks that an interpreted language can do and was necessarily limited by its origin as a preprocessor step in front of a classic C compiler. There were some minor differences like automatic constructor chaining in C++, as opposed to manual __init__ chaining in Python. There were some major differences like being able to dynamically set attributes on an object, and the replacement of data hiding by convention in Python.

Given that background, I'm just curious to hear the grounds on which Python can be classified as post-OOP. Any comments?

Fortunately or unfortunately, there's no single, one, common
definition for OOP. There is wide disparity in featuresets among
languages which are commonly held to be object-oriented.

Jonathan Rees gives us a nice catalog of some of the features
typically associated with OO here:

http://paulgraham.com/reesoo.html

In what respect is Python "post-OO"? Well, you could say that a
language which combines OO features with nice first class functions
and list comprehensions, while eliminating some of the Java cruft, is
"post-OO". But you could say the same for CLOS, or Self, which are 20
and 15 years old respectively, predating the widespread adoption of OO
by a good many years. So, maybe Python is "pre-OO"?

Here's an article in American Scientist alledging the existence of a
post-OO paradigm, including XP, aspects, and design patterns:

Message-ID: <FAEF90BE-1AE2-11D8-B544-003065B25CAA@intersight.com>

I have a two-screen mini test application.  Each screen has a page.Page 
subclass and a template associated with the page.Page.   Let's call 
them welcomePage and nextPage.  welcomePage.html has a form whose 
action is "nextPage."  WelcomePage has a wchild_nextPage() method which 
returns an instance of NextPage.

When welcomePage's form is submitted, WelcomePage's wchild_nextPage() 
gets called twice.  The first time it gets called with the expected 
request args, the second time the request args dictionary is empty.

Obviously I'm doing something wrong, but what?

Pages by default redirect so they have a / at the end. So you submit to
http://foo/nextPage and that gets redirected to http://foo/nextPage/.

Solutions:
1. submit to /nextPage/ from the start.
2. set addSlash=0 on NextPage.

So i followed Andrew's 'raw_input' advice with much success, but i
naturally wanted to dive into curses. I was checking out the
cursesclient.py file in doc/examples/, but it seems to be broken...

it connects and everything just fine, but as soon as i type anything, i
get the following:

-------------------------------------------------------------
--- <exception caught here> ---

                         exceptions.AttributeError: Screen instance

-------------------------------------------------------------

any ideas?

It's already been fixed in CVS:

    Many thanks for pointing that out.  Unfortunately it makes no
    difference to the behaviour with IE or Mozilla.  I've since tried
    with Opera 7 and it goes into the endless loop too, which makes
    me think there's a problem with the (X)HTML my Woven pages are
    generating and Mozilla is being very forgiving.

    I've tried adding the equivalent HTTP headers to the request
    headers in Woven and also run the generated XHTML through the
    W3C validator.  It reported a couple of errors with some
    <tr> attributes but nothing about the <meta> elements.

    This is the generated XHTML <head>:

I think this change introduces a race condition.  It's possible for a thread
to call callFromThread between the end of the for loop and the del
statement.

(callFromThread is defined as:
    def callFromThread(self, f, *args, **kw):
        """See twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorThreads.callFromThread.
        """
        assert callable(f), "%s is not callable" % f
        if threadable.isInIOThread():
            self.callLater(0, f, *args, **kw)
        else:
            # lists are thread-safe in CPython, but not in Jython
            # this is probably a bug in Jython, but until fixed this code
            # won't work in Jython.
            self.threadCallQueue.append((f, args, kw))
            self.wakeUp()
)

So I think it's possible to lose thread calls.  I *think* this patch will
fix it, but more eyeballs are always welcome with threaded code:

  That looks a little more complex than it needs to be.  What about this
version?


    def runUntilCurrent(self):
        """Run all pending timed calls.
        """
        if self.threadCallQueue:
            calls, self.threadCallQueue = self.threadCallQueue, []
            for (f, a, kw) in calls:               
                try:
                    f(*a, **kw)
                except:
                    log.err()

  I considered doing it this way first, but wasn't sure if anyone relied on
the identity of threadCallQueue (not that anyone should, but one never
knows).  If anyone thinks changing its identity should be avoided, I'd like
this version:

    def runUntilCurrent(self):
        """Run all pending timed calls.
        """
        if self.threadCallQueue:
            calls = self.threadCallQueue[:]
            del self.threadCallQueue[:]
            for (f, a, kw) in calls:
                try:
                    f(*a, **kw)
                except:
                    log.err()


  I suppose reverting it entirely is an option, seeing as how no one has yet
*actually* been bitten by the quadratic behavior (nor does it seem likely
that anyone will be), but all other things equal, it's nicer to use O(N)
algorithms deep down in the guts of Twisted than to use O(N**2) algorithms.

Yeah, that looks ok too, I think.  I'm less certain though... is it possible
for this to happen:

     reactor thread                 other thread
     --------------                 ------------
                                    call callFromThread
                                      ...get reference to self.threadCallQueue
     call runUntilCurrent
       ...set self.tCQ to a new list
       ...do for loop
                                      ...append to now old threadCallQueue

So that again, a call can go missing?  Hmm, I think this is possible, so
that version is also bad.  It's also harder to reason about than my patch --
I had to disassemble it to help me think about it :)

That's definitely racy!  What if the call to callFromThread happens between
the "calls = ..." and the del statement?

A version which does
    calls = self.threadCallQueue[:]
    del self.threadCallQueue[:len(calls)]

Should be ok though, for the same reason my patch is (or at least I think it
is :)

The main difference between that version and my is this one involves a small
list copy, but it might still be faster than executing "count += 1" on every
loop iteration.  Either way, it's at the point where I don't care :)

I think I'd like to see it improved to have O(N) complexity too.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Woven View factories: defered rendering?
Message-ID: <20031120032041.GA11694@pasternak.w.lub.pl>

Hi,

I have a webpage, that is rendered via twisted.web.woven.page.Page class.

In one of it's wvfactory_ methods, I need to send an e-mail. I would also
like to check if sending of the e-mail was successful (eg. mailserver is
up, running, and reachable via network).

I thought about something like this:

  def wvfactory_render(self, req, node, model):
      # do some stuff 
      sendEMail().addCallbacks(self.emailOkay, self.emailFailure)
      return # what should I return here?
      
  def emailOkay(self, *args):
      # render "thank you, e-mail sent" message 
      
  def emailFailure(self, *args):
      # render "error" message
      
My questions:
   1) is it a good, Twisted Python way to do this? If not,
      a) what would be the correct one? 
      b) can you point me to some docs?
   2) if it is a good way:
      a) is it implemented? if yes:
      	 1) what should I return from wvfactory_render? 
	 2) what parameters would be passed to callbacks then?
      b) if not, do you think it would be worth implementing?
      
I have seen something similar like the thing I want to code in some example
sources:

       def render(...):
       	   [ launch some callbacks ] 
	   return server.NOT_DONE_YET
  
... but they were about Resource class, and I'm using Page here.

Anyone?

Regards,

Same problem here, and I didn't find a solution. This should to the woven faq

Hi,

I know its been a while, but the project I needed this for has
gone on the back burner. I was going to do an example for
how I got the file to send and then do a recieve. I haven't got
around to it. So for posterity and for anyone else who hits the
same problem here is the modified ftp example that shows
how I uploaded a file using twisted. The answer was in the unit
tests I'd just forgotten twisted had them.

All the best,

om

Message-ID: <fc.005b8dcc029335ea005b8dcc029335ea.29336b9@samson.shu.ac.uk>

Hi,

This may well be a very trivial question but i have been trying to get the UDP
multicasting example in the "how to" section of the twisted documentation to
work and have had no success. I can do TCP message and normal UDP but cant
multicast it.

It does not report any errors but nothing every seems to be received by the
echo server.
Don't I need to explicitly join the multicast group at any point?

The code i have been using is as follows:
The multicast client:

from twisted.internet.protocol import DatagramProtocol
from twisted.internet import reactor
class Client(DatagramProtocol): 
	def datagramReceived(self, data, host):
	 	print 'Response Recieved:', data.strip()
		print 'From Host:', host
reactor.listenUDP(0, Client()).write('broadcast\n', ('224.0.0.1', 9999))
reactor.run() 

The original Echo server:

from twisted.internet.protocol import DatagramProtocol
from twisted.internet import reactor
class Echo(DatagramProtocol):
	def datagramReceived(self, data, (host, port)):
		print "received %r from %s:%d" % (data, host, port)
		self.transport.write(data, (host, port))
reactor.listenUDP(9999, Echo())
reactor.run() 

Thanks for any help,
Alan.

As I am a very, very lazy man, I'd like to hear from at least one Twisted
developer, that it's currently impossible (or unwise to do that) before
trying to implement such functionality.

... and I wonder if it's different for nevow.

Well, it's possible to do if you are willing to do some legwork
yourself.  If you override the render method of your Page, you can
manually handle waiting for the Deferred stuff to finish, because in a
Resource's render you can return NOT_DONE_YET and then call
request.finish() at a later time.  I've done that successfully. 

nevow handles all this stuff much more smoothly.  I wouldn't put a lot
of work into extending woven. 

b.g.

When will nevow will be considered as stable enough ? I won't create an entire 
app using woven if it's going to be depracated in 1 month :(
Btw, could you send us a  concrete example of what you were talking about ?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Mixmaster Architecture
Message-ID: <12452-02919@sneakemail.com>


Here's an architecture question for Twisted Matrix gurus.
I need to implement a "mixmaster" scheme, as follows:

                           |--> Remote client A
        UDP            TCP |
Server <---> Mixmaster <---|--> Remote client B
                           |
                           |--> Remote client C
                           |
                           ... (etc.)

Here is the background data:

Server <---> mixmaster is a custom binary protocol
over UDP transport.

Mixmaster <---> clients is custom protocol(s)
over TCP transport.  The most important client type
uses Telnet (raw).

Server and mixmaster script live on the same PC.
Remote clients have individual IPs and MACs.

Server is closed-source Java; I cannot change it.
Server's UDP communications is stock Java from Sun.
Clients are different closed-source systems (not PCs).
Mixmaster script is my Python.  How to architect it?

The Mixmaster script needs to multiplex communications
between clients and server.  The server will think it's
talking to N clients, all of which know its peculiar
protocol.  It's OK for the server to believe they have
the same IP address 127.0.0.1.  There is other identifying
information in the server protocol to distinguish the
clients (including MACs and device name strings).

I have an idea how to proceed, but still would like to
hear your advice, and thank you for it.

Woven has some, ahem, object identity issues. It really, really wants 
you to return an actual View instance from a wvfactory_. However, it 
does support deferreds being returned from the Widget.generate method. 
A deferred callback should mutate the incoming template node in place 
in order to cause some changes to the final page:

class MyDeferredWidget(widgets.Widget):
	def generate(self, request, node):
		theDeferred = doSomeAction()
		def theCallback(result):
			node.appendChild(
				request.d.createTextNode("the result was: %s" % result)
			)
		theDeferred.addCallback(theCallback)
		return theDeferred


class MyPage(page.Page):
	template = """<html><span view="theDeferredThing" /></html>"""

	def wvfactory_theDeferredThing(self, request, node, model):
		return MyDeferredWidget(model)


This is completely untested, but it gives you an idea of what to do. 
One of the main reasons for embarking upon nevow was that I knew a lot 
more about Deferreds than when I wrote woven, and woven's architecture 
made it very difficult to support deferreds properly. In nevow, the 
code might look like:


class MyPage(renderer.Renderer):
	def render_doSomeAction(self, context, data):
		return doSomeAction().addCallback(
			lambda result: "The result was: %s" % result)

	document = html[
	span[
		render_doSomeAction
	]
]

The point is nevow was designed from the beginning to handle Deferreds 
more gracefully than woven was. Also, because the paradigm in nevow 
sticks far better to "the return value of a callable replaces whatever 
came in" than woven ended up doing, it's impossible to get into funny 
identity situations where you're mutating an object but you don't see 
the result of it in the final page, because you were mutating a copy 
and it was the wrong object.

Bleh. My bad (well, and Pahan's). You want to use listenMulticast,
really, and you need to join() a group. See twisted.internet.interfaces
- the multicast stuff, and twisted.test.test_udp. I will remove the
offending docs.

No this is the wrong picture. Here's a right picture:

           |<--|              |--> Remote client A
        UDP|   |          TCP |
Server <---|<--|Mixmaster<----|--> Remote client B
           |   |              |
           |<--|              |--> Remote client C
           |   |              |
                             ... (etc.)

so you'll want something like

class MixmasterProtocol(protocol.Protocol) # the TCP side

    def connectionMade(self):
        self.udp = p = protocol.ConnectedDatagramProtocol()
        p.datagramReceived = self.datagramReceived
        self.server = reactor.connectUDP('127.0.0.1', PORT, p)

    def connectionLost(self):
        self.server.stopListening()

    def dataReceived(self, data):
        pass # handle data from TCP client, maybe use self.udp.transport.write

    def datagramReceived(self, data):
        pass # handle data from server, maybe use self.transport.write
 
> The most important client type uses Telnet (raw).

Make up your mind, telnet or raw? a Line-based protocol?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] wvfactory
Message-ID: <000001c3afaa$24c8b3e0$687ba8c0@vicky>

I have a form in a web page and I need to fill it with many sql queries
but only the first time the page is rendered.  
The other times, I want to fill it with the data from request.args.
 
I decided to build a dictionnary that looks like the dictionnary of
request.args to be able to use only one function to validate and fill my
form.
My function that fill my forms need to receive the dictionnary, the
document(node that I need to change) and a signature (signature is a
list of the name and the type of each elements from the form that need
to be fill).
 
In my template, I defined a wmfactory in the tag <form> that return my
dictionnary.  I?ve also define a wvfactory that call my function to fill
the form.
The problems is that wmfactory return a deferred so in wvfactory I have
to call my function to fill like this:  return
model.getData(request).addCallback(my function).  But I think that
return doesn?t wait that the addCallback is done.
 
Is there something I can do to make my returns wait for the addCallback
to return the new node filled with the dictionnary of data.
 
Here?s a part of my code:
 
#verify is the function that fill and verify my form
class handle:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def verify(self, dict, doc, signature):
        # dict is the dictionnary from the sql queries of the
request.args
        # doc is the node <form> and it?s child
        error = 0
        for item in signature:
            nodeList = domhelpers.locateNodes(doc, 'name', item[0])
            #INTEGER, FLOAT and STRING
            if item[1] == 'integer' or item[1] == 'float' or item[1] ==
'string':
                pass
            #CHECKBOX
            elif item[1] == 'checkbox':
                for node in nodeList:
                    # dict est None s'il n'est pas cochee
                    if dict.get(item[0]) != None and
str(node.getAttribute('value')) in dict.get(item[0]):
                        print 'checked'
                        node.setAttribute('checked', 'checked')

Message-ID: <10349-59812@sneakemail.com>


Thank you Moshe Zadka.  What you're saying is that TCP
connections can trigger ephemeral UDP pseudo-connections.

The server communicates over just one UDP port, and data
flow is bidirectional at all points in the chain.  I'm not
sure whether these facts affect the suggestion here.
The mixmaster opens its own assigned UDP port to receive
data from the server, as well as sending data to the
server over another UDP port.

> Make up your mind, telnet or raw? a Line-based protocol?

You're right, I should.  Here is the scoop.  For manual
device tests I'm using PuTTY in its "raw" mode.  That is
the origin of "raw."  Basically the telnet sessions are
line-based command/response activity.  The devices don't
utilize the full telnet protocol, just a small subset.

The terms "client" and "server" may be mixed up, from a
networking standpoint.  These are just conventions in the
legacy software, right or wrong.  The original authors
called the Java app a server, and the devices clients. 
However the devices supply information that the Java app
requests of them.  So the actual roles are reversed.

Normally, when talking to devices that know its protocol,
the system is very simple.  Here's how it works without a
mixmaster script.  The server initiates communications. 
The server broadcats a public query packet, and devices
respond with their names and technical features.  The
server constructs a list of known devices.  From there, the
server invokes various device capabilities.  When finished,
the server shuts down the devices.

Why the mixmaster?  Many devices offer identical
capabilites, but don't know the server's protocol.  The
mixmaster allows the server to use them.

My apologies for confusing terminology and my thanks for
your answers.

Mark

This is different. I believe twisted is responsible for the error report.  
It actually did, but for some reason it made itself fall into a dead loop.
I would like to call this bug, and encountered this when I play with
producer, consumer, etc. ( resumeProducing() is startReading!) I wish 
someone could fix this. Thanks.

You didn't make it clear that you actually considered this a
bug. Please post it to http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/ -- and please
include the errors that happen, etc, and any suggestions for
fixes. Thanks.

I'm running Python 2.3 on Windows 2000 version 5.00.2195 Service Pack 4 and
having trouble running the Twisted-1.1.0.win32-py2.3.exe installation.

I downloaded the .exe to a local folder, got to the Install button, clicked
on it and while the "Saving uninstall information" message was displayed but
before the progress bar showed any progress, I got a Setup message box
saying "CreateFile failed; code 5. Access is denied"

Can anyone tell me what code 5 means?

I've got 112 MB left on the C: drive, I hope that's not the problem.

I don't have a Windows installation to play with anymore, so this is just a
guess...

Mysterious installation errors are often due to installing Twisted and/or
Python as a non-Adminstrator.   Perhaps that's the problem here?

Both of them are slightly unaccurate. I'll update my slides for the next
time I give the tutorial to be consistent.

Well, you may be in luck. I've just re-written the ftp protocol for 
twisted. if you want an example of how to set one up, you can look (in 
the cvs version of twisted) at sandbox/slyphon/ftpsrv.tac.

You'll need to make some local edits (such as what you want your 
root/tld to be) but you can get a feel for how it can be done.

please note, the ftp server implementation is *very* *new*.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] tap2ntsvc future
Message-ID: <3FC00B0F.10703@twistedmatrix.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I've finished the initial work on tap2ntsvc.  This script does the
tedious work of creating an installer around your Twisted service.  A
quick howto:

1. Create a tap or tac file for your application, using the method you
normally use.  **Test with twistd to make sure that you can start the
app from the command line, _before_ you wrap a service around it.**

2. Acquire and install the prerequisites of tap2ntsvc.  It depends on
software outside of Twisted, specifically:
win32all @ http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html
Innoconda @ http://twistedmatrix.com/~moonfallen/innoconda.html

3. Run tap2ntsvc from the command line.  (*This is not yet integrated
with the "Twisted Command Prompt" available on MSWindows with the
official Twisted installer, but it will be when the script becomes an
official part of Twisted.) Use --help to get the command line options.
To start with, all you need to provide is the name of your tap or tac file.
| python .../Twisted/sandbox/moonfallen/tap2ntsvc myapp.tac
This will build an installable package using Innoconda.

4. Install the package.  It will be in myappsvc/myapp-...-setup.exe.

5. Start the service; it will fail, but you'll find out what modules you
need to add.
| net start myapp
**It's ok if this doesn't work.**

6. Check the Application event log to find out what modules failed to
import; you will be re-running py2exe after you add the missing modules.

7. Either: (a) re-run tap2ntsvc with the -i option or (b) add your
modules to myappsvc/setup.cfg on the "includes=" line.  If you choose to
do the latter, read myappsvc/README.txt to find out how to recompile
just the parts you need.

8. Redo steps 3 through 7 until you no longer get ImportErrors in the
Application log.

9. Some applications need data files.  If you need data files in your
application, consult myappsvc/README.txt and edit myappsvc/myapp.fms.
myapp.fms uses a special command language to make adding data files as
intuitive as possible.  You can put files in c:\Program Files\myapp or
any subdirectory thereof, so make sure your application code can find
data files there.

When you're done, you should be able to 'net start myapp' successfully.
~   When you want to rebuild it in the future, just keep these files in
your version control:
~  myappsvc/do_inno_script.py
~           do_inno.py
~           setup.cfg
~           setup.py
~           myapp.fms

Caveats, bugs, TODO:
- - you must be able to start your application in py2exe.  Things most
likely to not work are finding important data files based on the value
of __file__ in some module.
- - if you install the same service multiple times without uninstalling it
in between installs, then start it, then uninstall it, it will crash on
uninstall.  Just be sure to uninstall it in between installs while
you're experimenting.
- - I want to make the module finder more foolproof, saving several of the
steps above.  This is a non-trivial problem, however.
- - Really, it needs a frontend.  And I hate Tk.  Can I put a Gtk app into
~ Twisted proper? :-)


The future:
I want to move tap2ntsvc out of sandbox and into main Twisted.  I want
people to read this email over and try it before I do so, in case there
are important concerns I need to address.  We need to give some thought
to what to do about the 2 significant dependencies.  Should this block
tap2ntsvc from being in Twisted proper?  Is there a policy for this sort
of thing?

The wxsupport is broken, no matter which platform. That's why I invented the 
timer thing on ASPN. Wxsupport will fail the moment you open a modal dialog 
(or use a pulldown menu, which also is a modal). Probably there will never be 
a real reactor, well - unless someone with a lot of knowledge of both twisted 
and wxpython writes one. The problem is that wx - being platform independent 
uses the native event-loop, which behaves differently on windows, gtk or 
whatever. So a reactor would have to take care of that. The timer recipe 
works nicely though.

This is old and deprecated. Don't use it. Use the other (i.e. what the

Short question,
which is the adecuate way of doing unit test of a sequence of defered events ? one chained to the other.

If each deferred need a callback method, I have already more that thirty functiones defined, and each time I need more.

How to do it ?

defered = something

<the magic>

defered = the_next_thing # that need the previous defered to have been acomplished

etc...

I can imagine various tricks, but I supose there is a standart way. 

Thanks.

    from twisted.trial import unittest

    result = unittest.deferredResult(theDeferred)

  "deferredResult" iterates the reactor until the given deferred has a
result, then returns that result.

  See its sibling, deferredError, for testing of failure conditions.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] web/client.py add parameter to get raw redirects
Message-ID: <20031124085213.GA46767@clarkevans.com>

Hello.  I'm working on some testing harness for my application
(in twisted, of course) and I found I needed to record when 
the app is expected to send back a redirect.  So, this needed
a few changes in client.py ; if this seems resonable, I can
commit it.  - Clark

A little comment on unittest and the use of deferredResult. If you use
the optional timeout argument to deferredResult you have to be sure
that theDeferred's callback method has not been called before passing
it to deferredResult or you will get an error about pending calls when
twisted.trial cleans up after your test is run.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Woven problems after upgrading to 1.1.1rc1
Message-ID: <20031124152325.9436B428FC@server1.messagingengine.com>

After upgrading to 1.1.1rc1, when I startup my tap which starts up a web
server and a flash conduit server for LivePage, as soon as I try to
access the page with my browser, I get a never ending stream of log
entries as seen below.

I've attached 2 files, tap.py and pages.py, which contain most of the
code involved.

Let me know if anything else is needed.

trying to build Quotient-0.7.0 with Twisted-4.1.6 on OpenBSD with Berkeley DB (bsddb3-).
made change to atop/store.py to use bsddb3:
from bsddb3.db import *
 
i get this error:

this is the code at that point:

Hi,

I'd like to setup buildbot on my machine and help Twisted building and
testing packages - as my contribution to Twisted project. I can install it
on a 700 MHz / 256 RAM / NetBSD-stable machine.

Do you accept such submissions? Who should I contact about it?

Take care,

Yes indeed, thank you! Brian Warner should get in touch with you, as

Hi, I'm answering my own post for the benefit if future newbies:

I was having an awful time installing twisted on a W2K Professional machine.
In desperation, I uninstalled all the Python things (Python 2.3 and
Pythonwin), reinstalled Python 2.3, installed Twisted, and then Pythonwin
and all the installations seemed to go OK. Plus I rebooted in between the
installations because I didn't have a rubber chicken handy to wave over the
computer.

Not much of a technical note, but there it is.

Informal poll: How many of you out there have ever indulged a taste for
totemic decoration and/or fetishistic rituals in connection with debugging?

Hi, I just installed twisted python on my Windows XP laptop which has Python
2.3.2.

I went to install it on Windows 2000 Professional version 5.00.2195 Service
Pack 4 running Python 2.3 and got the following dialog box diagnostic:
"Setup: CreateFile failed; code 5. Access is denied." I've been able to
install piles of stuff on this system before, so I figure I have the
required administrative privileges. I logon to a Windows domain, and my ID
is in the Administrators group of the domain. There is a separate
Administrator logon local to the machine which I haven't used, and probably
can't get the password for, since this is a managed PC within the domain.

Here are my questions:

1) What does the "code 5" failure mean?

2) What am I doing wrong?

3) Can I just move the twisted site-package folders over from my XP system
Python 2.3 folder to the corresponding Windows 2000 Pro folder? I'm mostly
interested in just importing the twisted modules and prototyping; I can do
without the icons and start menu entries.

On my W2K laptop Twisted works without installation problems, since 1.0.7,
then upgraded many times.

You just described "in case of problems, format & reinstall" procedure,

Make sure mktap is running with same version as python as quotient was
installed with (both should be the same python, and version 2.3).

Message-ID: <6.0.0.22.0.20031125155558.01e4d8d0@anusf.anu.edu.au>

Hi all,

Before I move onto learning about cred, guard and more
sophisticated authentication schemes, I'm trying to get a
simple example working with basic HTTP authentication.

I have a resource subclass who's render() method checks the
values of request.getUsername() and request.getPassword():


class request_create(twisted.web.resource.Resource):
     isLeaf = 1
     addSlash = 0

     def render(self, request):
         if (not request.getUser()) or (not request.getPassword()):
             request.setResponseCode(401, 'Authentication required')
             return twisted.web.error.ForbiddenResource().render(request)

         # do work and render HTML ...

The problem is that no matter what I try getUser() and getPassword()
both return the string "" and the web browser never prompts for a
username/password.

Is the above enough for the simplest possible HTTP authentication
approach in Twisted web or should I be setting HTTP headers before the
request.getUser()/request.getPassword() is performed?

Any advice much appreciated,





Cheers,

Stu

I've looked at the log module documentation of twisted.python and more or
less guess that you can redirect the print statement to a log, and somehow
observe the stuff that is being logged in case you want to write it
somewhere else too. I was able to redirect the Python print statement to a
disk file, but am at a loss when it comes to properly configuring and
installing an observer. I want to observe the logging stream and throw it
out to a Tkinter text window.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

See http://twistedmatrix.com/users/roundup.twistd/twisted/issue393

But you should also read the appropriate RFC. You need to return an
Unauthorized status code (401) and appropriate header if you got no
credentials in order to request browser to send it on next request.

I have a serious problem with some woven applications where deferreds
and their results returned from wmfactory_ methods are not garbage
collected. They just stack up in gc.garbage. The python documentation
states that the contents of gc.garbage are objects that are part of a
cycle can't be collected because they have a __del__ method.

Any help on this issue would be really appreciated.

Deferreds have a __del__ method, used to log unhandled errors, which has
often proved to be a valuable debugging aid (people often forget to
.addErrback(log.err)).

Unfortunately, this means that Deferreds in reference cycles can't be
automatically garbage collected.  Can you boil this down to a minimal test
case?  This sounds like the probable cause of a memory leak some users have
reported with Twisted Web.

The trick will be to figure out what the reference cycle is, and breaking
it.  It may help to do:
    twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.debug = True
and then inspect the .creator attribute of the Deferreds the end up in
gc.garbage.  You could also try manually poking around with gc.get_referrers
on those Deferreds.

If we can find a good enough test case, we might be able to write a unit
test to trigger it and then check gc.garbage, so that we can include it in
the test suite and stop it from happening again.

I'm very keen to find out what's causing this -- let me know if there's
anything I can help with.

-Andrew.

It seems that it is only when the deferreds are instance variables in
the Page that they end up in gc.garbage. It might be related that an
empty Page class with a __del__ method also end up in gc.garbage.

The deferreds that are leaking are coming from pb (aReferenceable.callRemote).

I think that a minimal test case to show the problem would be: (I'll test this later, I have to go in five minutes time).

Pseudo code:
class Page:
   def initialize(self, ...):
       self._deferred = defer.succeed([1, 2, 3])

   def wmfactory_oneTwoThree(self, request):
       return self._deferred


My guess is that self._deferred will end up in gc.garbage.

I will test this later.

  Presumably at some later point you will have a line like
"self._deferred.callback(value)".  Immediately after this (actually, before
is preferable, how is left as an exercise for the reader), you should
"self._deferred = None".  The cycle will be broken and the garbage will be
collectable.

C-c and friends won't work, that's it. And reactor.spawnProcess may have
issues. This is a bug in wxPython which may have been fixed in newer
versions (and didn't occur in older versions).

No I just return the deferred to woven (with defer.succeed the
callback is already called).

I think I'll have to override Page.pageRenderComplete and set it to
None there.

Hi Jp. It seems that changing the wmfactory_method to do:

        def wmfactory_oneTwoThree(self, request):
            deferred = defer.Deferred()
            self._deferred.chainDeferred(deferred)
            return deferred

Does the trick.

Message-ID: <1069815840.3fc4182061cb1@webmail.telus.net>

I am running freebsd with python 2.2.2 and twisted 1.10

the same code worked fine on another server which is identical
except it is running twisted 1.07 

anyways

from twisted.internet.app import Application
from pyRtpRelay import TRelayService

print "Relay Going Up"
application = Application('pyRtpRelay')
RelayService=TRelayService(application)
RelayService.Start()

Inside my object TRelayService when I call

application.ListenUDP(XXXXXXXX) it will not listen on the required UDP ports and
returns None.

As a temporary hack I then when
       from twisted.internet import reactor
       reactor.ListenUDP(XXXXXX)

and it worked fine

Thanx John

This is for a reason, too complicated to get into (in 1.0.7 it would
sometimes return None as well, in some cases). You should upgrade your
code to use twisted.application instead of twisted.internet.app, which
is deprecated.

Also, sounds like you want to be doing reactor.listenUDP.

Is it possible (or even useful) to have a protocol which expects the
factory which builds it to have a specific interface? (as the protocol
has a .factory attribute and therefore can access methods and attributes
on it's factory)

or must all twisted.protocols be able to work with
internet.protocol.Factory() off-the-shelf?

Nope, it's perfectly fine to have a factory tightly bound to the
protocol. The reason that they're separate objects isn't for
separation of knowledge, but for having a 1-N relationship (N protocol
instances (i.e., connections) per factory).

i was going through the docs, and i found the two classes in

between the two.

i'd like to be able to make a sort of plugin that when the plugin package
is in the path, it interacts in arbitrary ways with my main application.
however, i don't think i'd want it to appear in mktap, as that doesn't
really make sense in this situation.....or does it?

  a DropIn is an abstraction for an entire plugins.tml file.

  a PlugIn is a single entity, typically corresponding to a register() call
in a plugins.tml file.

  mktap only shows plugins of type "tap" (because that is the only kind of
plugin it knows how to use!), so if you make your plugins of a different
type, they won't show up there.

You can have different types of plugins. For example, mktap uses one
kind of plugin, but twisted.lore uses another. IIRC there's a type
keyword arg that indicates what kind of plugin it is.

I've figured out that part. I created a plugin directory, and i set the
type to "myPluginType"...now how do i access my plugin from within the
app?

i've got this in my plugins.tml file:

register ("My plugin package",
		"core.plugin",
		description = """
		Provides functionality to my app.
		""",
		type ="myPluginType")

i did the following in the interpreter:

>>> from twisted.python import plugin
>>> plugin.getPlugIns("myPluginType")
[<Plugin 'My plugin package' core.plugin>]

so i guess my question is, what to i do with this plugin object? i see it
has a property named "module", which is the string i gave it of
"core.plugin". this file doesn't exist yet since i don't know what to put
in it.

i guess i just need a little more guidance. i'm looking through the code
too, but i'm not sure what calls what...

thanks for any help,

  Call .load() on it, and do something with the result.

Hi!

I'm playing with the twisted irclogbot example .. I've no problem in the 
ircnet, but it I always get disconnected from the efnet, but a eggdrop on the 
same machine has no problem

[21:34:05] [connected at Thu Nov 27 21:34:05 2003]
[21:34:51] [disconnected at Thu Nov 27 21:34:51 2003 reason([Failure instance: 
Traceback: twisted.internet.error.ConnectionDone, Connection was closed 
cleanly.
])]

I've looked at it with tcpdump and got following, but what should that tell 
me:

NICK bla!
NOTICE AUTH :*** Looking up your hostname.
USER bla! foo bar :None
NOTICE AUTH :*** Checking Ident
NOTICE AUTH :*** Found your hostname
NOTICE AUTH :*** Got Ident response

  432 is erroneous nickname.  Likely, the server doesn't like the "!" in
your nick.

I am not sure if this was just the most creative unsolicited mail I 
ever received, or if it's a complaint from an unsuspecting user.  I 
think the "werewolf" comment is from the "AUSPEX" capability of the 
POP3 server.

Have crackers been using Twisted for some nefarious scheme?

	Hi,

	I'm new to the list and I'm just starting with Twisted and Woven.
	I think the framework is great, but I'm having some problems.
	When I try to make two nested <div>, both with independent queries,
	I get na error, the solution I've found is to create another model
	called "loaddata", which does nothing, except call the queries.
	If anyone knows a better way, I'd like to hear, I've searched all
	over the Internet, and found nothing that could help.

	Thanks in advance,

Robert,

your questions have nothing to do with Twisted, those are IRC problems. It's
closing link, because - propably - mydnsname.com is not allowed to connect
to that IRC server. I'd suggest e-mailing some local irc-oriented newsgroup
or list. Thank you.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] PyProtocols 0.9.1 Released
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20031128160119.028e9dc0@mail.telecommunity.com>

What is PyProtocols?
--------------------

PyProtocols is an extended implementation of PEP 246, adding a new 
"declaration  API" that lets you easily define your own interfaces and 
adapters, and declare what adapters should be used to adapt what types, 
objects, or interfaces.  Using PyProtocols, you can easily make flexible 
frameworks that you or other developers can extend without needing to 
modify the base framework.  PyProtocols interfaces can interoperate with 
those of Twisted and Zope, or can be used entirely standalone.

PyProtocols may be used, modified, and distributed under the same terms
and conditions as Python or Zope.


What's new in version 0.9.1?
----------------------------

* Implemented Samuele Pedroni's "subproto" idea (see 
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2003-June/036242.html) as the 
new 'protocolForType()' API.

* Added other APIs to automatically generate protocols, such as 
'protocolForURI()', 'sequenceOf()', and 'Variation()'.

* Compatible with Zope X3 Milestone 4, Python 2.3.2, and Twisted 
1.1.0.  (Also runs on Python 2.2.2+, if you don't need Zope 3 compatibility.)

* New 'Adapter' and 'StickyAdapter' convenience base classes

* Fixes for compatibility with 'ExtensionClass', and for a memory leak in 
the optional C "speedups" module


PyProtocols Resources

Hi,

This is an initial inquiry to find out if anyone really familiar with 
Twisted would want to join me in the development of
a Spammer honeypot system to release into the public domain.

A recent "securityfocus" article seems to indicate some project like 
this might be worthwhile,  and Twisted seems
to be the perfect tool for this....

Not only would it be used to "fool" spammers,  but it also could be 
used to "detect" proxy connections from IRC
bots,  and return the proper "fingerprints" to convince the spammers 
this is a really legit proxy.

I've done a lot of research in this project,  and come to the

Well, I'm no expert on twisted-web, but I wanted to answer your question
in at least a general sense. It is indeed possible to perform such a
task, as twisted.web's object lookup is completely customizable. Drop in
on #twisted on irc.freenode.net and ask someone in there, or if no one
else responds to this thread, email me and I'll help you find out how to
do what you're interested in doing.

I see what's wrong here.

This is part of finger22.py

    def getContext(self):
        """Create an SSL context.

        This is a sample implementation that loads a certificate from a 
file
        called 'server.pem'."""

        ctx.use_certificate_file('server.pem')
        ctx.use_privatekey_file('server.pem')
        return ctx

I should have substituted the certificate_file to the certificate file..

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Re: python-list query re sockets, select or: twisted and other file-descriptors & twisted question
Message-ID: <061d01c3b6fa$2d0a12e0$210110ac@jsbwxp3>

In response to the question about doing serial i/o and using a select
statement, I'd like to quote from
http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-select.html

select(iwtd, owtd, ewtd[, timeout])

This is a straightforward interface to the Unix select() system call. The
first three arguments are lists of `waitable objects': either integers
representing file descriptors or objects with a parameterless method named
fileno() returning such an integer. The three lists of waitable objects are
for input, output and `exceptional conditions', respectively. Empty lists
are allowed, but acceptance of three empty lists is platform-dependent. (It
is known to work on Unix but not on Windows.) The optional timeout argument
specifies a time-out as a floating point number in seconds. When the timeout
argument is omitted the function blocks until at least one file descriptor
is ready. A time-out value of zero specifies a poll and never blocks.
The return value is a triple of lists of objects that are ready: subsets of
the first three arguments. When the time-out is reached without a file
descriptor becoming ready, three empty lists are returned.
Among the acceptable object types in the lists are Python file objects (e.g.
sys.stdin, or objects returned by open() or os.popen()), socket objects
returned by socket.socket().  You may also define a wrapper class yourself,
as long as it has an appropriate fileno() method (that really returns a file
descriptor, not just a random integer). Note: File objects on Windows are
not acceptable, but sockets are.  On Windows, the underlying select()
function is provided by the WinSock library, and does not handle file
desciptors that don't originate from WinSock.

(end quote)

So, select might not yet work on Windows serial ports as well as sockets.
This is also a subject of interest to me, but all I can think of is handling
the sockets via select() and polling periodically for data on the serial
port using callLater() and some win32 calls. Maybe the win32 serial port
handling could even be wrapped in a 'waitable object' as described above for
use with the Python select() call.

I recall reading somewhere that the twisted framework has the ability to
handle serial communications in connection with Global Positioning System
device interaction, but don't have any information about it. I'm going to
post this to the twisted mailing list :

Question for twisted folks: How can I add serial Windows serial port
communications as a twisted protocol? Please cross-post back to the
python-list.

Your problem is most likely Deferred models of which you need a

That's correct.  Windows select is from the Winsock library, and only works
with sockets.

Thankfully, pySerial has already taken care of the details of cross-platform
serial-port access (apparently, I've never used it):

Twisted uses pySerial, so the platform you're running Twisted on shouldn't
matter.  There are some examples in the doc/examples directory of Twisted
that use the serial port:

    mouse.py -- example using MouseMan protocol with the SerialPort
                transport
    gpsfix.py -- example using the SerialPort transport and the NMEA 0183
                 and Rockwell Zodiac GPS protocols to display fix data as it
                 is received from the device.

Message-ID: <20031101104118.GA21085@nixel.mine.nu>

I'm writing a socks proxy that uses ssh tunnels for connections, I can
get it working by making my connectClass listenTCP with a
forwarding.SSHListenForwardingFactory and then ClientCreator a
SOCKSv4Outgoing to connectTCP, but obviously that's a bad method. 

How can I cut the listen/connect? Is there a way I can do it at that
level or do I need to implement my own .connectSSH method?

It seems I need to get both sides placed in the reactor somehow,
but SSHChannel.conn doesn't have a fileno() so addReader doesn't accept it.
(Is addReader the right function? I found it in the curses example and
 am assuming it's just a generic file descriptor handler)

Thanks much

You should definatly look at adding this feature to Conch when you
finish it.  That's been on the TODO list for a while.

Basically, you're going to want to override SOCKSv4.connectClass and
SOCKSv4.listenClass.  connectClass returns a Deferred that is called
back with an unused value.  listenClass returns a Deferred that is
called back with a tuple of (host, port) that is being listened on.

I got it working this morning, I'll add to to conch (I assume you mean
the conch.py in the scripts directory?) and submit it. It
actually wasn't difficult, well the program is like 60 lines, but it took me
a good 12 hours of keyboard time to write and pleanty of idle brian

thing incorrectly/correctly, or whether I've missed anything that would 
be obvious to an experienced twisted developer.

The protocol provides for sending get, getnext and getbulk requests, but 
doesn't yet support trap or answering any query (i.e. in SNMP-eese it's 
a manager-only protocol at the moment, not an agent-side protocol).

I'm particularly interested in:

    * whether the timeouts are handled properly (we do a crude callLater
      and check for deferred.called for them), is there a more elegant
      Twisted mechanism for handling timed-out operations?
    * whether the message IDs are handled properly (we just store all
      "live" messages in a dictionary and delete them when they are
      timed out or responded to), is there some more elegant Twisted
      solution?
    * whether the entire approach is okay. I put most of the code and
      API on the protocol object, with a helper object for managing
      tabular downloads.  Is there a more "Twisted" way of doing this? 
      Should the get method on the protocol be implemented as a separate
      object driving the protocol as well?  What should be in the
      "protocol" level, (as opposed to higher-level "application" code)?

Package is here:
    http://members.rogers.com/mcfletch/programming/TwistedSNMP-0.1.tar.gz
It requires pysnmp-3.3.5, available here:
    http://download.sourceforge.net/pysnmp/

You'll need an SNMP agent against which to test (as well as some OIDs 
for that agent), as the ips in the scripts won't work without the proper 
community IDs (or from unrecognised manager IPs, for that matter).

Feedback appreciated,
Mike

I haven't yet looked at your code, but there is a .setTimeout method on
Deferreds that sounds applicable here.  By default it will errback your
deferred with a defer.TimeoutError, but you can pass in a custom timeoutFunc
if necessary.

One thing to watch out for when using setTimeout is that you need to wrap
your calls to d.callback/d.errback in try/except defer.AlreadyCalledError,
in case the timeout does happen (alternatively you could pass in a
timeoutFunc that arranges for whatever would call callback/errback to be
cancelled, but that might be harder).  This is probably already the case
with your existing timeouts, though.

Again, I haven't looked at your code, but that sounds ok to me :)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Adapting RemoteReferences
Message-ID: <20031103134114.GA9164@twistedmatrix.com>

Hi,

What is the general opinion on having a standard way to adapt
RemoteReferences to specific interfaces which basically just
wraps callRemote for each respective method?

The reason i'm bringing this up is I can imagine various
use-cases for wanting to treat remote objects and local objects
as semantically equivalent. For example, I may be employing
the observer pattern for a simple system to separate UI components
from data components. Currently if I wish to have both remote and
local observers interoperate I would have to either store them
in separate data structures and treat each differently when
sending notifications, or, I could store them in a single
data structure and use appropriate type-checking to dispatch the
calls. IMHO both of these solutions are relatively ugly.

Whether or not there are sufficient use-cases for a standard twisted
way to do this is another story, so i'm wondering what the views of
people are on this subject. Certainly one could just register their own
adapter for RemoteReference in each case, but the code to do this is rather
ugly and for those that _do_ have to deal with such cases I think it would
be nicer to have a simple, standard way of doing it,
e.g. remoteRef.adaptTo(Interface).

I've written a function that outlines the functionality I think it should
provide which is included below; while this implementation is rather ugly
i'm more worried about the idea rather than how it would eventually be
implemented if someone decides this is worth having.

Of course, there are certain constraints, such as the method wrappers
having no way of knowing if the remote object actually implements the
desired interface or not, but I don't see this as a problem for something
that already requires string based dispatch. I guess you could say this
proposal is somewhat similar to java's 'stub' approach, only it doesn't
force it :-).

Cheers,

Sam.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Socket Read Write
Message-ID: <000b01c3a202$8b1f6270$6401a8c0@ISLAND>

I am writing a chat socket server and need to make sure that there are no
conflicts when writing to other attached clients. I am concerned that when
the server receives lots of messages from many socket connections, several
sockets may encounter write contention. 

Is there a queue for the write method of a socket? 
Should one expect errors in this regard?
Does the Twisted architecture eliminate this class of error?
Using twisted.protocol.basic can 2 lineReceived events happen
simultaneously? How is this addressed?

Twisted's network code is single-threaded.  Only one event is processed at
once, so the answers to your questions are:

> Is there a queue for the write method of a socket? 

No -- there doesn't need to be.  The transport will buffer any write that
isn't immediately writeable without blocking, but because you never do this
from more than one thread at a time, there are no possible races here.

> Should one expect errors in this regard?

Nope :)

Yep :)

They can't happen simultaneously. :)

  I think the preferred approach is the opposite.  Instead of taking remote
references and trying to treat them as local, take local references and
treat them as remote (this makes sense from an interface enforcement
consistency point of view, too -- it's easier to throw away some information
than you have than to pull information you don't have out of thin air).

  See twisted.spread.util.LocalAsyncForwarder.

Indeed, this does make more sense, I don't know why I didn't think of it in this
way. The way you have described also takes care of emulating the Deferred result
instead of having to specify it as part of the interface as well.

On the other hand, you still end up with basically the same level of interface
enforcement; that is, you can guarantee the interface characteristics of local
objects but not remote objects. This is unlikely to change however, without either
the protocol changing (unlikely - "did somebody mention IDL? :-)") or people obeying
their own interface definition conventions. Still, I can certainly see your point that
publishing an object as implementing an interface when it possibly doesn't is worse
than wrapping a local object with a single string-based dispatching method. 

Other small differences I can think of are that in cases where a system has already
been written and a remote interface is being provided, it may be easier to make
chanes to the effect of:

    # part of remote system wrapper class
    def remote_addObserver(self, observer):
        underlyingSystem.addObserver(observer.adaptTo(IUserInterface))

    # part of the underlying system
    # (code that was written prior to considering a remote interface)
    def addObserver(self, observer): self.observers.append(observer)

So if the underlying system was built without a remote interface in mind
it may be easier to just adapt the remote refs than to change every instance
of calls to the local objects.

If it _was_ written with the knowledge that a remote interface will be placed
on top in the future, I assume the code would look something like:

    # part of remote system wraper class
    def remote_addObserver(self, observer):
        underlyingSystem.addObserver(observer)

    # part of underlying system
    def addObserver(self, observer):
        if not isinstance(observer, RemoteReference):
            observer = LocalAsyncForwarder(observer, IUserInterface)
        # rest of method ...

And then all subsequent calls would use callRemote.

I guess which one you prefer is purely a matter of style and I can
see no real disadvantages from the later approach unless of course,
the system has already been written.

Thanks for pointing this out.

Sam.

The PB rewrite in warner's sandbox has (or will have, anyway) schemas
for security.

Until then, you need to do enforcement manually.

Message-ID: <401C60E417B68B48B14B53D845FF596A8D24FC@EMSS07M12.us.lmco.com>

I've got multiple input buttons and their view is the same logic. The logic
is delete some data on a button press, then rerender the page with the
updated data. The data it will remove depends on the unique ID of the button
pressed.  When the web page is rerendered the view gets called for each
button with the same http request, so the deletion logic will be evaluated
for each button, even though it should be evaluated for just the button that
was pressed. I don't like that. I want to clear request.args so the behavior
will be as if there was only one http event, corresponding to a single
button press. I tried "request.args.clear()", but that doesn't seem to have
the expected effect.

What's worse is when I click the browser's reload button, request.args still
has the last http request that occurred. In other words, if I click my
delete button the page will be rerendered with updated data, then if I click
the browser's reload it will try to delete more data as if I had hit on of
my delete buttons again. Can anyone help me with this problem?

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0311020959380.13083-100000@shasta.stanford.edu>

I need a front-end to a complex of Zope systems.  The front-end listens on
an address/port and examines incoming http transactions, and, based upon
http headers and other information, connects to one or another of the Zope
systems.  The underlying approach is straightforward -- a Listener waits 
for a http transaction, it spawns a receiver which gathers the message, 
decides what to do, spawns a sender to the destination.  When the sender
responds, the process is reversed.  

I currently use an adaptation of Antony Baxter's pydirector to do the job.
I use his asynchat version, but have found that it leaks file descriptors
in my application.  I've not tried the twisted version.

So I thought I'd try to craft a tailored, light-weight version using 
the twisted framework.  I see how to manage things when everything works, 
but what if one or another of the endpoints fails?  How do I get 
everything cleaned up?

Why not use the Twisted version of pydirector? If it doesn't do exactly
what you want, submit patches.

The twisted version does nothing much different from the asyncchat 
version as far as I can see.   Both have comments about a race condition 
on closing which I suspect may be the source of my file descriptor leak.
(Actually, I think it's a socket leak... )

Nevertheless, I'd expect it'd be easier to fix a single bug than to

darn,  this was something I was also looking for,  but (sigh) that site
must be down right now,  I cannot get anything from that URL.   Would you
happen to know where I can find some good examples of forms processing I can
look at?     I'm still suffering from a lack of useful examples.  The Twisted
tutorial doesn't cover ANY examples of how to process forms pages.

I'm also looking for an implementation of a SMTP server.  A simple one,  just to show how all the components are tied together.   This is what Twisted really lacks,  documentation on how everything is tied together.   The tutorial covers some of that,  and does pretty good job,  but there are NO existing documentation on how to implement the simplest of SMTP servers,  although it appears there are alot of object that support it,  there just isn't any documentation that tell me how it's all tied together.

Vickey,

  Here is something that could get you started.   "request.args" returns a 
dictionary of the forms data,  including buttons.

  Copy and paste this code into your Python window and run it,  and 
using your browser,  go to this URL  http://localhost:8080 and play
with it.

from twisted.web import server, resource
from twisted.internet import reactor

class Simple(resource.Resource):
	isLeaf = True
	def render(self, request):
		"""

Hi guys,

is there a way to have one service start several processes ?
When using twisted everyone connecting to the server ends in the same process. 
This leads to "slowing down" when requesting information whenever a certain 
number of people go on. Each request takes some time to process and meanwhile 
the server is less responsive. I have one particularly expensive function 
that takes a bit. So if several people happen to use this function at a time 
the server slows down, up to where it takes a minute to complete.
It's not a problem of system ressources (it's a quad processor xeon server 
with plenty of RAM and ultra 320 scsi drives running only this application 
and the postgres backend). The machine has a load of 0.2 while slowing down.
Basically most of the machine is idle, since it only runs 2 processes and has 
4 processors.
Is there a way to have twisted do something like apache or postgres and split 
the incoming connection to several processes ? It's not a web application, 
I'm solely using pb.
BTW: You might suggest to break down the expensive function into smaller 
pieces - no way. It has to run in one database transaction otherwise I might 
end up with a inconsistent database - no good in finance business.

Thanks

What does this expensive function do? If it's standalone, involves heavy
computation, or blocking resources, running it in a thread pool should
allow you to improve latency. In cases where it goes into C code, it
should also improve performance as it should release the GIL when doing
that.

If that isn't good enough, Quotient has some code for dispatching tasks
to multiple processes.

This is possible, although not as easy as I'd like it to be.  In 
principle, on most UNIX-based OSes, it's possible to listen() and 
accept() in one process, pass the returned file descriptor to a 
subprocess and do communication there.  I'd like to make this automatic 
at some point, but won't have the time to do it for at least another few 
months.

The fact that it's not as graceful or automatic as I like doesn't mean 
it's impossible though.  If you want to just have one "control" process 
that shuttles around I/O and N worker processes that do the actual work, 
you can still use spawnProcess and communicate over stdin/stdout to the 
subprocesses about new connections using a simple protocol which 
multiplexes multiple socket connections down to the one pipe connection 
and back.

Also, if database latency is your main problem, or you can move a little 
bit of performance-sensitive code into C and relinquish the GIL while 
they're happening, you can just use callInThread to run your 
transactions in threads instead of having the reactor waiting on them.

Is this helpful?

Would it help you to have the ability to open a database transaction and
keep it open while you do other things?  I have a patch to adbapi that
adds an API to do this.  It's in daily use on my development system but
I haven't quite finished cleaning it up for submission. 

b.g.

This is also useful for using privileged sockets (ports < 1024).  For 
example, on OS X in a GUI environment one can start a subprocess with 
root privileges w/ the Authorization framework, open the privileged 
socket, and pass it back to the parent process that does not have root 
privs.

Am I severely confused here?
The entire point of Twisted (to me anyway) seems to be
to  provide non-blocking interfaces to long-running
and/or blocking resources.

I thought that was the whole point of it being
event-driven.

Long-running yes, blocking, no. There is no magic way to make a blocking
API not-block. So you need to either rewrite from scratch, or use
threads.

For example, "send an email and return success or failure" can be
written using non-blocking APIs, since sockets have non-blocking APIs.
Calling a DB-API database adapter's cursor.fetchall() method can not
(unless you want to rewrite the database's wire protocol).

But cant I write my code in a manner so that even if
every database call timed out infinitely, my
non-blocking access to it will simply deferr every
response until my machine runs out of resources to
handle the stalled db connections?
(while still responding promptly to the front end web
connections)
That's my understanding at least...

I'm already doing that, but without using adbapi. When I started this project 
adbapi was no choice and now it's simply not an option to rewrite a lot of 
code to something I expect to be even slower than my code. I use a very lean 
row class based on slots and a db interface that handles the schema itself 
without me supplying it. This certainly is database dependant but I can 
afford to support postgres only.

I figured that the impact of callInThread is much higher to the rest of the 
system than I like. I'm already using deferToThread a lot, however there are 
limits to the usefulness of threads.  For example I use it to do page 
formatting (printjobs). Each of the printjobs is about 120 pages to format. 
If I start 20 to 30 such formatting jobs with deferToThread twisted virtually 
becomes unresponsive. If I limit to a max of 3 or so it works. I admit I 
don't understand this, since IMHO defering to a thread should make it 
independant from the parent. I didn't dig into this problem since It's not a 
big deal to limit to a few such jobs at any given time and use a spooler type 
interface to suspend requests for later.

I think I suffer from database latency in general and with the expensive 
function in particular. The expensive function could be moved to a thread and 
maybe I'll give it a try. However if I do this for every method that writes 
more than 10 or 15 records to the database I'll most likely end up with 
thousands of threads. Currently the system is used by up to 15 people, but 
projection goes to 400+ people at any given time. I don't have a problem with 
having people wait for a result, I have a problem with the other people that 
don't get a result because the framework stops responding for a couple of 
functions that just take more than a millisecond to execute. 
I'd rather have 500 processes like with apache and have the OS do the 
scheduling - which is way more efficient than having the framework schedule.
The most expensive function I have (besides the printing mentioned above) 
executes in about 3 seconds. This is not "blocking" in my understanding, 
since the function never waits for something to happen, it just calculates 
and stores stuff. Twisted is unresponsive for those 3 seconds. Multiply that 
by 10 users and one user might end up with a delay of more than 30 seconds 
before his "3 seconds" are evaluated. If I had a lot of processes the OS 
would schedule that more efficiently since then the function might take 5 
seconds to complete, but it would be interrupted by the OS scheduler to hand 
processing time to one of the other processes. 

Maybe I'll look into splitting into n worker processes. Since this would 
involve going into twisted code, where would I start looking ?

Yes. If you run the database query in a thread.

  But it doesn't, not in Python.  Each thread adds new contention for the
GIL, which makes every thread less responsive.  If the print jobs were
managed by a C extension which could release the GIL before doing its work,
then they would be mostly independant.

  Yea.  If you only have 4 CPUs, it doesn't make sense to be running 400
CPU-bound threads :)

  It is blocking.  While the term usually refers to a function that waits
for some I/O to finish, it applies equally well to any functions that run
for a non-trivial amount of time and, while doing so, prevent the rest of
the application from proceeding.

  Before doing that, you might consider just spawning a handful of worker
threads and giving them queues.  This keeps the application responsive by
not forcing an insane number of context switches but also still allowing all
the expensive functions to run independently of the I/O thread.  

  There is even a ThreadPool class in Twisted already (though I have never
used it myself ;), so giving this approach a try should be pretty quick, and
if it is still not good enough, you haven't lost much time.

  This is not to say that multiple processes would not also be a good
solution, just that it might be a harder one to implement.  If you do end up
looking at multiple processes, reactor.spawnProcess() (as glyph alluded to
earlier) is one way to go about it.  This is basically the equivalent of
popen2() (though with a lot more flexibility).

  On a related, but not necessarily useful note, I've recently begun
investigating ways of moving the state associated with a user request,
including the associated socket object, between processes.  My use case is
not load-balancing, but the code should apply equally well to this as to
what I intend to use it for.  It requires C extensions (which are currently
-just- good enough to play around with higher-level stuff in Python with). 
The code is very short, and lives mostly in sandbox/exarkun/copyover/fdpass.py
in CVS HEAD.

No, Twisted has a thread pool, so if you are using Twisted APIs you
won't get more than the max number of threads the pool is configured to
use.

If Twisted is unresponsive, that means it blocks. Any function that
takes more than 10ms should probably count as blocking, really. Try
running it in a thread. Because of the global interpreter lock, this
won't reduce runtime, but it'll enhance responsiveness to other clients.

In general, it sounds like you are doing a lot of database queries. Some
ways to optimize this:

1. Do less queries - cache, merge identical requests, etc.. 
2. Do a number of queries in a single transaction in a single thread,
rather than deferToThread, get result, run another query with
deferToThread again, etc..
(3. Don't use RDBMS. Use an in-process database like ZODB or Quotient's
atop when it's done.)

Don't use it! :)  Use reactor.callInThread, as we've been saying.
ThreadPool is an implementation detail of the default reactor, at this
point.

I know and I increased the threadpool limit a bit. Not much though because in 
the end it all runs on one cpu. I asume that if I start say 50 threads via 
deferToThread and the pool limit is 25 the requested threads are started when 
one becomes available ?

Responsiveness is what I need. Users are happy to wait a couple seconds if one 
can notify him and his screen still shows some "progress".

Yep - I already started moving some of the things into the database as stored 
procedures. This reduces the execution time tremendously since it get's rid 
of the DB API overhead. I know I still have some optimization potential by 
handing data blocks between methods so a particular method doesn't have to 
requery the database for something an other method already did.

I already do this, at least in some parts. You're right, the thread handling 
overhead is way too high to have single simple queries running in a thread 
each. It doesn't make sense to use a thread which costs you 1ms to set up for 
something that only runs 1ms.

:-) I'd probably do that with a web application, but even there I'll allways 
prefer a "real" database system. In process databases may be faster, therefor 
they are less relieable and correcting errors is a virtual impossibility.
Also the sher size of the data I handle would make something like ZODB blow up 
to a couple gigabytes in one month alone. 
Since my customers generally can afford it I rather use big iron for a couple 
thousand $$ to make the database faster. Specially in the finance and 
insurance industry it also makes the management happier if they see some big 
machines that look impressive in the rack. That's what they're used to and it 
gives them confidence in their investment (although one probably only uses 
10% of the machine :-) )

That explains it. Maybe I'll go ahead and create a separate "print" server 
process that just produces paper. I'm using reportlab and I even had to turn 
off the c extensions used in reportlab, because they are not threadsafe. 
Printing isn't a big deal at this time, simply because I gave them a "print 
later" checkbox which will suspend formatting and printing for the night. At 
night I then just process all the printjobs sequentially.

I think a mixture of both might be the best approach. Having several processes 
would be great for MP machines, so one has the ability to scale on a hardware 
basis. Making more intelligent use of threads could increase responsiveness. 
One user is fine wating  for something to happen, but all the others 
shouldn't have to wait for the one user too.

I'll check that out. I wouldn't name it load-balancing. Would be interesting 
though to check if one could have a single "socket server" that distributes 
to several processes on several machines :-) For an application like mine 
load balancing might be much easier, since I could make the clients reconnect 
to a different server/port.

They are not distributed as far as I know, but the .spec file
(Twisted/admin/twisted.spec) should produce RPMs without trouble.

My question goes along the previous one in this thread.
How do you get the browser to prompt for a username and password?
My code is not woking and goes something like this: On every page request 
a certain function is called, say genpage()...

def genpage(request)
     request.getUser()
     request.getPassword()

     return "hello world"


-> Browser does not prompt though. (And this does not even involve woven)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] SelectReactor, readers and writers
Message-ID: <20031106164555.GA16990@psychlaw.com.au>

Hi,

While looking at the code for the default SelectReactor I noticed
that the selectables are stored in the form {object : 1, ...}.
Is there any particular reason they're not stored in the format:
{ fd : object, ...}? A couple I can think of are that duplicate
file-descriptors would cause problems (which they currently most
likely would anyway) and objects which return different values from
fileno based on context would no longer work correctly -- are either
of these use-cases valid?

The reason i'm bringing this up is because since 2.3 (I think) calls
to socket.fileno are wrapped in a python function (as defined in
socket.py) which I assume, when called in a tight loop over a large
number of objects may result in a bottleneck (I certainly remember
profiling code in the past where this was the case).
This could be alleviated by passing a sequence of integers to select
instead of the connection objects themselves.

It could be that i'm missing something, or it could also be that this
has never come up because until a short time ago socket.fileno was, of
course, a C function :-).

Another thing to think about for the future is that on September 10
selectmodule.c was changed so that select.select now supports any
sequence. Currently SelectReactor makes a list from the readers
and writers dictionary (calling dict.keys()) every iteration -- of
course this is likely to remain the same for a while considering
the need for backwards compatibility and i'm not even sure if the
patch has been backported to 2.3 yet (unlikely since my 2.3.2 is
dated Oct 6 and it does not exhibit this behaviour). Still,
it's interesting to note for the future.

Cheers,

Sam.

Comment out the section that tries to compile the extension needing
rpc.h in setup.py (That's what I did). Just subsititute the test that
tries to find out if rpc.h is available with False so that the branch
is never entered.

Also when you get the build to work the twisted.scripts.twistdw.py
script is broken, fix it by looking at twistd.py.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] MANIFEST.in for RPMs
Message-ID: <oprx5rlf08k1a6kk@sfmail3>

If anyone has an interest in using the bdist_rpm option with setup.py to 
build Twisted RPMs, the MANIFEST.in file needs the following additions:

     include twisted/runner/portmap.c
     include twisted/protocols/_c_urlarg.c
     include twisted/lore/template.mgp
     include twisted/web/woven/FlashConduit*
     include twisted/web/woven/WebConduit*
     include twisted/test/process.alias.sh*
     include twisted/test/rfc822.message
     include twisted/test/server.pem

Also, for a Twisted installation that works with any installed version of 
Python (e.g. 2.2 and 2.3), you can install Twisted to /usr/lib/site-python 
by adding these lines to setup.cfg:

     [install]
     install-lib = /usr/lib/site-python

/usr/lib/site-python seems far more convenient than 
/usr/lib/pythonX/site-packages, don't know why it isn't the default.

The view factory is called once per use of that view in the template.
If you use the view for three buttons, your view factory gets called 
three times. Whether there were any button presses or not.

Maybe you should move your "delete" logic from the view to the render 
method, or to a model that is used only once in the template. That is 
only called once per request, and is a logical place to do some processing.

You should use a POST method for submitting the form; then the browser 
is not allowed to just resend the request without confirming the action 
from the user.

You should look at having a pool of worker _processes_, to which you 
dispatch work with pb.

Not threads, as python threading will not really scale, and there's 
really no point in threading if the amount of input/output to the worker 
is small enough (shared mem has its good and bad sides).

If you listen in a parent process, fork multiple children, and make the 
children accept, unix does the right thing. I don't think Twisted knows 
how to do that out of the box, but it should be doable.

That's assuming you don't need (much) shared data between the children.

If you are lucky, you can find a threading DB library (adbapi) that 
actually scales. The other mail in this thread are more helpful there..

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Deferred problem
Message-ID: <000001c3a471$e6b30ee0$687ba8c0@vicky>

I know that I'd already post a message about deferred but I think I
haven't understand very well.
 
I have a function that is suppose to return a new dictionnary but it
returns a deferred.
 
 
class MainPage(pages.BasePage):
    templateFile = "main.html"
  
    def initialize(self, dbpool=None):
        self.dbpool = dbpool
    
    def setUp(self, request, *args):
        var = self.initPermissions(request)      #var is suppose to get
the new list
        print var
 
    def wmfactory_welcome(self, request):
        return "Bienvenue, %s" %
request.getComponent(myguard.Authenticated).name
 
    def initPermissions(self, request):       #create and return the
results of a sql query
        group = request.getComponent(myguard.Authenticated).group
        listGroup = group.split(',')
        sql = "select permission from permissions where 1"
        for item in listGroup:
            sql += " or permissions.group='%s'" % item.lstrip()
        theDeferred = self.dbpool.runQueryDict(sql)
        return theDeferred.addCallback(self.makeDict)        # suppose
to call makeDict when the results has arrived
 
    def makeDict(self, results):
            # when I print what is in results, I can see all the data
from the sql query
        listPermissions = []
        for item in results:
            listPermissions.append(item.get('permission'))
        return listPermissions                   # return the new list
but the function setUp receive a deferred
 
 
I've put some comments in the code to help you understand what I want.
The big problem is that var receive a deferred and not the new list

Because it's wrong. Twisted has C extensions, and those are specific to 
the version of Python used to compile Twisted.

Even without C, the bytecodes generated for the installed .pyc files are 
different between python versions.

That python will try and import every time, and if you don't have the 
same python version installed it will recompile them every run.. and 
not be able to save them for permissions reason.

Handling form input in a way which is both very abstract and easy for 
the programmer to use without a lot of edge cases has turned out to be 
very difficult. As you may have heard, 'nevow' is the name of a new 
exploratory implementation of the woven ideas which will eventually 
become woven 2.0.  One of the goals of nevow is to take the ideas 
originally explored in twisted.python.formmethod and 
twisted.web.woven.form and re-implement them so they are cleaner, 
easier to use and extend, and have fewer edge cases. The new, 
in-development modules are nevow.formless and nevow.freeform.

Formless is a module which allows you to annotate object properties and 
method parameters with types (By declaring that the 'foo' property is a 
String, and the "bar" method takes two Integers, for example). Freeform 
is a module which uses this type information to automatically render 
forms on the web, perform input validation and form error rendering, 
and ultimately call methods on your objects or set properties on your 
objects.

I am at this very moment doing a lot of freeform development, so now 
would be a good time to raise your use cases, your expectations about 
using a system which renders and validates web forms, etc.

A good place to contact me is in #twisted on irc.openprojects.net. My 
nick is fzZzy.

I have been put in the unfortunate position of having to 'renovate' a 
lot of existing WebKit oriented CGI scripts. As you would surmise, they 
are a complete failure wrt OO design.

The main use case for me is to generate a form that in itself sets the 
constraints, and thus not requiring much input validation. All the 
scripts I have to deal with present varying views into a DB. Without 
delving into the schema makes it hard to convey what I need.

I guess all I was looking for with Woven was some OO based mechanism to 
build a form w/o all the wvfactory and wmfactory methods for each form 
'widget'

I will take a look at Formless and see how far that gets me.

Thanks for your time!

setUp is receiving a Deferred from self.initPermissions, but then doesn't
wait for its result to arrive.  You should instead do something more like:

        def setUp(self, request, *args):
            d = self.initPermissions(request)
            def printVar(var):
                print var
            d.addCallback(printVar)

Although ideally you should add an errback too, even if it is just
twisted.python.log.err.

(I don't know how this will interact with the rest of Woven, but hopefully
I've clarified how you should be using Deferreds a little)

Good link. I might start using that for some things.
For now I solved the scaling issue with an (more or less) ugly workaround. 
Since I'm using pb with  dedicated client software I made the logon a 2 step. 
The first step connects to a certain port and gets an IP-address and a port 
back. The server determines which process has the least number of clients 
connected and returns that address. That's where the client then connects for 
real work. So I now just have a bunch of twisted's running on different ports 
- - works nicely for a quickhack.
But in the long run I'll definitely have to do something about the database 
and automatic forking of more server processes.

class Foo:
    def doStuff(self):
        ....

You have to have the request.

session = request.getSession()
session.foo = Foo()

Now later in your application you can do:

foo = session.foo
foo.doStuff()

If you use the twisted web server for more than one logical
application you should probably do something like this.

class MyApplicationSession:
   .....

session = request.getSession()

session.sessions = {}

session.sessions[MyApplicationSession] = MyApplicationSession()

And something similar but another class for other applications.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] pb help needed.
Message-ID: <ullqspdi5.fsf@inout.no>

I have a bug in my woven application which manifests itself as
win32select failing after doing many http requests. The error is the
constant WSAENOBUFS and I it seems pretty likely that this is caused
by some socket related resource leaking for each request I make. This
hypothesis is further supported by observing that a host of
pb.ClientFactory instances are stopped when shutting down the
application after it crashes. This seems strange to me as I am
thorough in shutting down the connector after every request is
finished.

Turning to that trusty friend printf style debugging, shows that the
PBClientFactory is stopped correctly when performing requests to pages
that use the referenceable and wait for it's deferred's to
complete. There are two cases when it doesn't stop. 

The first is when I press reload quickly a number of times. Then I
just see start messages because my request finish method is not called
(it is a callback to the deferred returned by request.notifyFinish()).

The second case is when I call disconnect on the connector before it's
deferred has been realised. I see in the log the following pattern:
Starting pb.PBClientFactory, disconnect and then the attached event,
stopping factory is not called at all. After stepping I see that
disconnect doesn't do anything when it is called before the connection
has been realized.

So I have a bug, and it's in my code. My question is how does one
manage pb resources correctly and easily (I don't worry about
performance just yet) when each user needs to have it's own
connection?

Here is what I have come up with so far. It doesn't solve the problem
where I don't get the request finish callback, but seems to be able to
disconnect even if not connected when disconnect is called.

class MyPBClientFactory(pb.PBClientFactory):
    def disconnect(self):
        if not self._broker:
            deferred = self.getRootObject()
            deferred.addCallback(
                lambda unused: pb.PBClientFactory.disconnect(self))
        else:
            pb.PBClientFactory.disconnect(self)

Since the last post I moved to a persistent PBClientFactory so that
disconnects is not a problem. This fixes the crashes, but there are
still resources that are not released. I only see perspective attached
messages in the log, until I kill twistd when I get a host of detached
messages. My next question must be how do I detach the perspectives in
an orderly fashion after each request? This seems to run into the same
problems as I had with not being able to do cleanup for each request.

Hi,

I'm playing with woven and twistd. Every time I change something, I have
to stop the server, and start it again (except for HTML changes in
templates). Am I doing something wrong ? This is very painful to restart
every time !

I'd love to see a deploy tool like a j2ee application server (you would
just put your tap in the deploy environnement, and the app server loads
it automatically). There was such a tool before in twisted, but it was
removed :( (can't remember the name).

thx for advice !

Syver,

I'm the win32 buildmeister, so I'm looking for this bug to see if I can
reproduce it.  Are you sure you hit "save" on the bug? I can't find it
on any combination of win32, compile, build, windows...

Also, assigning it to me probably wouldn't be a bad thing.

The twistw bug was submitted, and has already been fixed:

Isn't this a fairly significant change to the API?  Now doing
deferred.addErrback(log.err) will log the error, and then log it again when
the deferred is garbage-collected...

I guess it won't actually break anything, just add some confusion to log
files, but what's the new idiom for

    d.addErrback(log.err)   # log and swallow any errors that happened

going to be?

Yes, and an unnecessary one.  Revert it, and add a 'passerr' method, if

Actually, it will break things, as exarkun pointed out on IRC:

	foo.addErrback(log.err).addCallback(cleanup)

will no longer call 'cleanup'.  Totally unnecessary breakage.

How does twisted shut things down and recover resources when implementing 
a reverse-proxy.  If one or another of the endpoints dies, I would expect 
there to be some shutdown code to close open sockets, etc.  but I don't 
seem to be able to find it.  Can someone assist?

anyone here using Quotient?
it builds, but on 'mktap quotient' i get an error
where it tries to build 'atop'.
it tries to import '_bsddb'. I am using bsddb3 - which
i believe is the more recent version of bsddb. i can
fix the import, but then i have problem with procs
within. stops at DBEnv() which is supposed to be in
bsddb3, but doesn't seem to be available.
any thoughts/clues?

It sounds like both your pybsddb  bindings and bsddb system library are 
too old.  Try upgrading.

1.1 no longer has the concept of detaching. You can track live
perspectives and choose to not allow users to login if there's still a
connection, or not as you will. Look a bit at
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/pclients, and put the
appropriate logic in your realm'ds requestAvatar.

I'm not used to having actual users for this code :)

I'll see about adding it sometime this week and doing a new release. 

Long term plans include rewriting to use java.nio when newpb is done, so
if java 1.4 is a problem better say so now. Probably will include EIO
high-level async framework and Straw PB-based transparent java RMI if I
can, and maybe even java cred so you can write PB servers easily.

I put a somewhat different version there.
Outside of some cosmetics, not that it .addBoth the logout to the
notifyDone. This is important: the user should be logged out if the
request is severed mid-output

Of course, simpleguard.MarkingRealm can be used for that :)

Dear All Twisters out there.

I am a complete Twisted newbie (with a little bit of Python experience) 
and having just installed this (what looks like) a great package, I 
would like advice on my next step.

I am looking to start doing simple (spider) based web clients but really 
would like a guide or tutorial before jsut spending hours pulling my 
hair out. Where do you advise me to go. I have had a look at the 
Tutorial on Finger but this seems like a major development in an area I 
don't even understand.

Is there any specific newbie guides being built or assembled  possibly 
by those on this list.

Thanks for your help with something that could just change my life (well 
a bit of it anyway).

Graham

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted and mod_python?
Message-ID: <JAEDJDIBADCJHPFLNEDFIEHKCBAA.pb_twisted@olga.mine.nu>

I am wondering about the feasibility of using mod_python in an Apache server
to make PB requests to a Twisted application.

That is, I have a Twisted application which servers PB requests, e.g. a user
manager. I also have an Apache server. I would like the Apache server to
present dynamic web pages based on the contents of the user manager
application, to act as a web front end (e.g. create/erase/modify user
properties). I was thinking that it could be possible to use mod_python and
Twisted to act as a client to the user manager.

My questions are:

1. Is this possible, fesible and/or reasonable? If so, any hints or examples
would be welcome.

2. Any alternative/better solutions?


I suppose it would be rather easy to use CGI instead, but I'd like to
explore the options.

okay, so if i've got a tap with the following updateApplication method:

def updateApplication(app, config):

and i want to access that app.registry attribute from an arbitrary
location, how do i do it?

i seem to remember hearing that there was only one instance of Application
in a process, so does that mean that there's some (forgive the Java-speak)
static method defined on the Application module that will get the current
running instance?

  The old way of doing this would be...

    from twisted.internet.app import theApplication
    theApplication.registry

  However, this bites.

  Newly written programs should implement makeService() instead of
updateApplication().  As a bonus, purely service-based programs can easily
and cleanly do things like the above:

    from twisted.application import service

    class RegistryService(service.Service):
        def __init__(self):
            self.registry = registry.Registry()

    def makeService(config):
        s = RegistryService()
        ...
        anotherS = SomeotherService()
        anotherS.setServiceParent(s)  # Or s.setServiceParent(anotherS)
        ...
        return s # or return anotherS

  `s' can be the parent service of other services, in which case it can be
accessed simply by looking up the parent service, or it could be a child
service of something else, in which case it would be accessed via a call to
getServiceNamed() on the appropriate parent.

  This avoids the need for globals and lets services/applications be more
readily configurable alongside other services/applications (since neither
will have global state that might interfer with the other).

Okay, that answers another question I had, but I'm still not clear on how
to get at that service object from a couple of places.

For example, here's my Realm implementation:

class InnerSpaceRealm:
    __implements__ = portal.IRealm

    def requestAvatar(self, avatarId, mind, *interfaces):
        if pb.IPerspective in interfaces:
            registry = ### how do i get this?
            avatar = UserPerspective(mind, registry.get(avatarId))
            return pb.IPerspective, avatar, avatar.logout
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError("no interface")

what's the right way to get that service object?

this issue comes up again in my UserPerspective class, where i need to
access that registry object during perspective_xxx methods...

there is a part of me that just wants to use registry as a one-off class
with a class variable that returns the current instance, but i don't like
that part ;-).....

thanks again,
-phil

  Like so:

    class InnerSpaceRealm:
        __implements__ = portal.IRealm

        def __init__(self, service):
            self.service = service

        def requestAvatar(self, avatarId, mind, *interfaces):
            ...

  ;)  There are other ways, but I'm sure you don't need me to point them
out.  The key is, just do the obvious thing here.  There's no special way to
manage this.

You'd need to start the Twisted event loop up on each HTTP request.
Or... kinda. It's possible anyway, but you'll need to investigate
mod_python's interpreter lifetime model.

Finger is trivial. It asks a remote server for info about a user.

E.g. "finger foo at example.com" at a unix command line will ask
example.com, using the finger protocol, for foo's info, whatever that
is. Typically a finger server will return contents of the file ".plan"
from the user's home directory.

I might add that this is exactly the reason that Realm is an interface 
and not a class.  Considering that "session logic container" has 
infinite variability in its implementation, the restrictions on how a 
Realm has to work are _really_ light.

That means threaded programs with cfreactor will be really slow.

I think the issue is that the unix waker uses python sockets. You
probably want to write your own waker using whatever APIs you are using.

While we're at it - warner, could we have the mac os x reactor also run
tests with cfreactor?

It's theoretically possible, but almost certainly a bad idea.  Do you 
already have a large mod_python-using codebase?

If not, Twisted includes HTTP support for a reason.  Just use it :).  To 
communicate with your apache server, use mod_proxy or something similar 
to just relay requests to the Twisted web server.

If you do have a large mod_python-using application already and you are 
trying to get it to talk to Twisted, you probably want to continue to 
use the mod_python execution model rather than spin up the twisted event 
loop and switch back and forth: while it's possible if you really need 
it, a better architectural strategy in the average case (to avoid odd 
interactions between the assumptions mod_python has about its 
environment and the assumptions twisted has about its) would be to use 
Twisted's XMLRPC support and talk to it using a blocking XMLRPC library 
from your mod_python scripts.

I don't know what the deal is, exactly, because it uses python sockets 
internally and that works perfectly fine.  I believe that something 
about the waker causes the run loop to think that it's always awake.  I 
didn't feel like looking too far into it.  That said, Apple's 
implementation of CFRunLoop does everything that the reactor does (and 
then some), including thread waking and other thread communication 
facilities.. so when I have more time I'll look into the cause and the 
appropriate solution.    IIRC the only part of Twisted that uses 
threads on its own is the DB stuff, anything else would probably be 
implemented using more native means (nobody uses cfreactor for 
cross-platform applications yet), so I don't see an immediate problem 
with ignoring the waker.  I'd rather punish threaded (from what Twisted 
sees) applications than make all applications really really slow and 
resource hungry.

Others have already said that the right way is to "push, not pull":
give the service object as an argument to __init__.
I wanted to add that the correct way to pass the registry to
UserPerspective is probably much the same thing:

class UserPerspective:
    # ...
    def setRegistry(self, registry):
        self.registry = registry

class InnerSpaceRealm:
    __implements__ = portal.IRealm
    def __init__(self, registry):
        self.registry = registry

    def requestAvatar(self, avatarId, mind, *interfaces):
        if pb.IPerspective in interfaces:
            avatar = UserPerspective(mind, self.registry.get(avatarId))
            avatar.setRegistry(self.registry)
            return pb.IPerspective, avatar, avatar.logout
        else:
            raise NotImplementedError("no interface")

If there are better thread communication facilities in the CFRunLoop, 
then make your reactor's call[From/In]Thread use them.  There's nothing 
intrinsically useful about the waker; it's an implementation detail of 
callFromThread which could be better done in another way.

However, "really slow" doesn't quite describe the problem.  A server 
which sends an event to a thread without a waker and then receives a 
callFromThread may never wake up, if there isn't more network activity 
happening.

Twisted/sandbox/moonfallen/tap2ntsvc.py

If you have an Twisted application that you want to make into a service
on Windows, give this a try.  It's very basic right now; it absolutely
needs py2exe and Inno setup support before I'll consider it done.  The
goal is to have the output be a complete binary package analogous to the
output of tap2deb or tap2rpm.  The only difference will be that, instead
of depending on software like the Linux versions do, it will do as much
as it can to help you include the dependencies in the package using py2exe.

Right now, nothing beyond generating a service script is done.  Here's
the help:

Usage: tap2ntsvc.py [options] <filename>
Options:
~  -y, --type=          Config file type: pickle, xml, source, or python
~  -o, --output-file=   Name of the setup executable produced
~  -n, --name=          Short name of the service (used with "net start")
~  -d, --display-name=  Human-readable name of the service
~  -e, --description=   Description of the service
~  -r, --reactor=       Reactor to install (like twistd) [default: default]
~      --version
~      --help           Display this help and exit.

Do something like . . .

| python tap2ntsvc.py myapp.tac

The output is myappsvc.py (or <name>svc.py).  Then you run myappsvc.py:

| python myappsvc.py install
Installing service myapp to Python class
C:\myapp\myappsvc.myapp_ServiceControl
Changing service configuration
Service updated

| net start myapp
The myapp run by Twisted service is starting.
The myapp run by Twisted service was started successfully.


Give it a try, let me know if you have any problems with it.

Thanks,

C

Oh, does that work now? If I recall, that used to hang the buildslave.

I'll give it a try and turn on a cfreactor pass if it works.

My tests failed:

24:buildbot at quartz% python2.2 bin/trial -to -r cf twisted.test
...
  File "/Users/buildbot/Buildbot/slave/OSX-full2.2/Twisted/twisted/internet/cfreactor.py", line 42, in ?

It might be related to the following warning during the compilation phase:

 gcc -arch ppc -bundle -flat_namespace -undefined suppress build/temp.darwin-6.8-Power Macintosh-2.2/cfsupport.o -o twisted/internet/cfsupport.so -framework CoreFoundation -framework CoreServices -framework Carbon
 ld: warning dynamic shared library: /usr/lib/libSystem.dylib not made a weak library in output with MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable set to: 10.1


It doesn't hang, so I'm going to turn on the test anyway (it will just fail
all the time). I don't know a lot about OS-X linker magic.. somebody else
will have to figure out the problem here.

I will not EVER support that version of Python 2.2.  You'll need to use  
python2.3 ( http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython/index.html ) or  
upgrade the machine to OS X 10.3.  If it works under that version of  
python, it's purely by chance.

And we do want a 2.2.0 buildbot going, since that's useful, and lets us
test OS X 10.2's python. Run another buildbot I guess?

Yep, a reactor without a waker is essentially broken. It'll also break
the SIGCHILD handler in CVS. Please do try to find a solution before our
next release.

Signals need a whole different approach because signals do not wake up 
CFRunLoop, so when you install handlers it wakes up once a second 
anyway.  The correct solution is to use a mach port waker for signals, 
I have not implemented this yet because there are no mach port 
facilities available from Python yet (I looked into it, but doing mach 
ports use a lot of C macros, so it would be hard).

When is next release planned?

so i followed jp's advice, and my makeService method now looks like this:


###############code#################
def makeService(config):
    registry = Registry()
    reg_service = RegistryService(registry)
    portal = Portal(auth.InnerSpaceRealm(reg_service))
    checker = auth.RegistryChecker(registry)

    pb_service = internet.TCPServer(int(config['port']),

    reg_service.setServiceParent(pb_service)
    return pb_service
###############code#################


when i try to build my tap file now, i get


###############traceback#################

i've tried this both ways, with pb_service as the parent, and with
reg_service as the parent, with the same result.

btw, i am working out of a freshly checked-out cvs directory, but i doubt
that matters.

thanks again for any help,

AHA!

i needed to have my parent class subclass MultiService, right? so i tried
this, and the tap built fine...hopefully it was the right thing (still
testing)...

class RegistryService(service.MultiService):
	def __init__(self, registry):
		service.MultiService.__init__(self)
		self.registry = registry

def makeService(config):
	registry = Registry()

One problem I had with a python windows service in general ended up being
related to the following tech note.  Took me forever to figure out what
the problem was, but every one of the symptoms in the tech note applied. 
I'm posting this to hopefully save other's the headache.

The immediate output you see is as follows:

E:\scripts>winsvc.py start
Starting service RatControlService
Error starting service: The service did not respond to the start or
control request in a timely fashion.
E:\scripts>

More info was available in the event logs as described in the tech note.

Message-ID: <02f901c3a99a$4eef28e0$8209500a@jsbwxp3>

Hi, I just installed twisted python on my Windows XP laptop which has Python 2.3.2.

I went to install it on Windows 2000 Professional version 5.00.2195 Service Pack 4 running Python 2.3 and got the following dialog box diagnostic: "Setup: CreateFile failed; code 5. Access is denied." I've been able to install piles of stuff on this system before, so I figure I have the required administrative privileges. I logon to a Windows domain, and my ID is in the Administrators group of the domain. There is a separate Administrator logon local to the machine which I haven't used, and probably can't get the password for, since this is a managed PC within the domain.

Here are my questions:

1) What does the "code 5" failure mean?

2) What am I doing wrong?

3) Can I just move the twisted site-package folders over from my XP system Python 2.3 folder to the corresponding Windows 2000 Pro folder? I'm mostly interested in just importing the twisted modules and prototyping; I can do without the icons and start menu entries.

Don't use a TCPServer as a parent, use a multi-service

    m = service.MultiService()
    reg_service.setServiceParent(m)
    pb_service.setServiceParent(m)
    return m

Subject: [Twisted-Python] SSL.SysCallError in doRead

Hi,

I noted the following exception while running some msn related
code earlier:

2003/11/14 05:09 EST [PassportLogin,client] Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "/home/sam/Twisted/twisted/python/log.py", line 65, in callWithLogger

            data = self.socket.recv(self.bufferSize)
        SSL.SysCallError: (104, 'Connection reset by peer')

On closer inspection it seems that the surrounding try/except clause only
cares about SSL.SysCallErrors which pertain to unexpected EOF and all others
are re-raised. The only reason I can come up with for why this is the case is
that it was not anticipated that other exceptions (like the one above) could
arise from the given recv call. I would expect that in the above instance,
connectionLost should be called, but it may very well be that i'm missing some
subtlety so I am yet to submit a bug report.

Cheers,

Sam.

What is important here is if you or the group you are member of in the

computer managment (or whatever) and see which users/groups are
members of the adminstrators group on the local machine (not the
domain admins).

  In tcp.py, on line 114, this exception is being caught and logged, then
CONNECTION_LOST is being returned, which should cause all the appropriate
lost-connection-callbacks to be invoked.

  The error is logged just to err on the side of being overly informative. 
It shouldn't interfere with connectionLost or clientConnectionLost.  If it
is, please do file a bug report.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] LivePage CACHING Problem
Message-ID: <20031113163859.5A293415FE@server1.messagingengine.com>

Hi,

I am currently trying to use LivePage to update the cells of an html
table with results from processes initiated in various PB services.  The
client intiates requests in the services and those services call back
into the client's (a pb.Referenceable) remote_updateStatus method to
update the table which displays the results.  I have test code that
simulates this and everything works fine.  Javascript is sent to the
browser to update the cells of the table.  Works really slick.  However,
now that I tried to hook it up to PB, the LivePage javascript sending
part isn't working.  When I make the page.sendScript(script) call I get
the following in the log.

2003/11/13 10:25 CST [Broker,client] Sending javascript to page
<twisted.web.woven.utils.WovenLivePage instance at 0x4089944c>
2003/11/13 10:25 CST [Broker,client] CACHING
[<twisted.web.woven.utils.Script instance at 0x4089906c>]

All future sendScript calls append the script to the cache.  Everything
else is working appropriately, and all code is executing as I'd expect,
except that the javascript doesn't send properly.  Is there something in
particular I should be looking for here?  I don't see what I'm doing
different, but since LivePage is quite magical to me I'm not sure where
to look.

On a slightly different note, is there LivePage-ish support in nevow, and
do you recommend moving to that yet?

Thanks.
-Justin

Last question (sry, I'm still a newbie in twisted :p) :
where do I put my blocking code ? just before the defer.succeed ??

I'm sure this has been answered a million times before, but here goes...

Deferreds do not magically turn blocking code into non-blocking code. If
you place blocking code in a wmfactory_ method, it will still interfere
with the event loop.

If you have blocking code, you can either rewrite it in a non-blocking
manner, or you can use a separate thread to run it.
<http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/threading>

If you give more detail about what you're trying to do, I'm sure one of
the Twisted gurus can explain what the best approach(es) might be.

I'm sure too. But I proposed a long time ago (and several times) to use
a forum instead of a mailing list...

I thought of using the setUp method of page. I can start the calculation
when the page loads, but I don't know what to call (in the callback)
when it's done (a wmfactory_xxx ?). I'll check the threading part you
gave me. Thank you !

This is a terrible excuse. Not only do we have our *own* archives:

http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python 

which, of course, are searchable via google: 

"deferred blocking code site:twistedmatrix.com"

there are *multiple* archives elsewhere that have a built-in search
functionality as well:

http://marc.free.net.ph/list/twisted-python.html

http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.twisted

I found these with a trivial amount of googling: "twisted-python
mailing list"

Having searchable archives is obviously no reason to switch to a web
forum (ugh), as we have that right now.

Unfortunately, I don't think there's any special support in Woven to
handle Deferreds from setUp. You can return Deferreds from
wmfactory_XXX and Woven will handle them correctly: it will not finish
rendering the page until that Deferred has fired and the model is
ready.

Hi 

the doc string of adbapi.Augmentation mentions just using the ConnectionPool

"A class which augments a database connector with some functionality.
This class is now deprecated. Just use the ConnectionPool directly.
Conventional usage of me is to write methods that look like..."


Presumbably this means DONT inherit from ConnectionPool like you
used to inherit from Augmentation( or am I reading that incorrectly)
and just create a ConnectionPool instance and run the queries through that.

But I think it works okay to subclass ConnectionPool ...
at least, it works for me.  Is there a better way to
do something like the following (which is working fine)?
(Admittedly you need to see my other modules for the full
picture, but you can infer what they would do ... as
you can probably guess, I don't use t.e.row.RowObject.)

Sure, there's no particular reason that subclassing ConnectionPool
can't be done, but the only difference is that you're using methods
like "self.runQuery" instead of "self.db.runQuery" (after doing
"self.db = ConnectionPool(etc)". I probably wouldn't subclass unless I
actually wanted to override one of the methods in ConnectionPool with
a modified implementation and then use it in the same place that a
regular ConnectionPool is expected.

I thought of using the setUp method of page. I can start the calculation
when the page loads, but I don't know what to call (in the callback) when
it's done (a wmfactory_xxx ?). I'll check the threading part you gave me.

Well, on the other hand I wouldn't be reading that anymore. A mailinglist has 
the advantage that it comes to you. I think the likelyness of getting an 
answer is much higher with a mailinglist. To be honest I don't think that 
storing the stuff in a forum will make the FAQ's disappear. People just don't 
search thru the forum, pretty much the same as they don't read FAQ's and 
search mailinglist-archives.

The problem with a forum is that you have to physically go and look to 
see if anything has been posted.
I like forums and have been involved in a number over the years, however 
once the workload increases I tend to find it harder and harder to find 
time to visit and eventually stop visiting altogether. My mail however, 
I always read as it's there *in your face* so to speak.
I'm lazy like that :o)

To address your main points:

- Topics can be nicely seperated
Thats what threading is for, if your mail client does not support it 
then there are many out there that do (I use Thunderbird).

- Past knowledge can be easily searched.
I can easily search through the emails I have from the past, plus 
there's always the archive (URL given in a previous post).

- Email inboxes can be freed from much clutter
Ok, I'll give you that one - although I don't class it as clutter! A 
bunch of mail filters and a handy mbox archiving
script (written in python I might add) keep my system nice and tidy :o)

/me goes back to lurking

This is pointless. If you don't want to subscribe to the mailing list,
don't: just use one of the web interfaces to it that I pointed out
earlier.

If you want to post to the mailing list without requiring moderation,
and you want to read messages through the web and NOT receive them
through the mail, then subscribe and set the "nomail" option on your
account.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Documentation Question
Message-ID: <20031110221220.GA4281@mit.edu>

Being new to twisted I may be lacking a clue, but finding the
proper arguments to twisted.application.internet.UDPServer()
was a major pain in the butt.  

Only by looking at the code could I find all the valid arguments and
that took a lot of tracing because the valid arguments are determined by
listenudp() it seems.

Is their an easier way or is it always frustrating to determine the
acceptable arguments to an init function? 

Thanks,
Steve

Almost correct.
The idiomatic way is

class SomeOtherService
    # .... do something interesting here
    def registry(self):
        return self.parent.getServiceNamed('registry')

def makeService(config):
    s = RegistryService()
    s.setName('registry')
    anotherS = SomeOtherService()
    m = service.MultiService()
    s.setServiceParent(m)
    anotherS.setServiceParent(m)
    return m

The trick is to have 's' and 'anotherS' completely symmetrical,
and allow them to access each other.

Everything else Jp said, including the part about "globals bad,
explicit references good" has my whole-hearted blessing.

As Mr. Armstrong just explaned, you can do all this and more with
the existing mailing list archive. It's here:

http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python
 
You don't need to be subscried to the list to read the archive. Topics
are nicely seperated. Posts can be easily searched using google. Is it
too late to use the tools we already have before dumping 'em for a
bulletin board? Hm?

And, of course, the mailing list isn't the only source of documentation.
The official docs are far from perfect, but they're getting better (over 300
pages as a PDF, when I last checked!).

For cases like this question, there's the FAQ.  I've just checked in an
addition to it that hopefully addresses this question.  It should be visible
here in a few minutes, once buildbot does its thing:

Well, others (and elsewhere, myself) have given the reasons that the 
labs won't host a forum, but I think it would be great if someone else 
would do so.  I've said before that the Twisted community needs more 
than one medium for communication, it seems that enough people here 
have a preference for forum software that it's viable to set one up.

Please send me a link to put on the tm.com site when you do so.

This is a terrible excuse. Not only do we have our *own* archives:

http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python 

which, of course, are searchable via google: 

"deferred blocking code site:twistedmatrix.com"

there are *multiple* archives elsewhere that have a built-in search
functionality as well:

http://marc.free.net.ph/list/twisted-python.html

http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.twisted

I found these with a trivial amount of googling: "twisted-python mailing
list"

Having searchable archives is obviously no reason to switch to a web forum
(ugh), as we have that right now.

Unfortunately, I don't think there's any special support in Woven to handle
Deferreds from setUp. You can return Deferreds from wmfactory_XXX and Woven
will handle them correctly: it will not finish rendering the page until that
Deferred has fired and the model is ready.

i absolutely agree with all of your points. i don't have the hatred of
web-based interfaces that you guys seem to ;-), but i think that there is
definitely a bit of elitism coming into play.

we (as proud geeks) know all the google tricks and mailman preferences to
get things to behave as we like them to. but let's face it, there's more
to gaining "acceptance" or "market share", or whatever you want to call
it, than appealing to the developers.

obviously, that is the level twisted is at now, and i agree the need for a
forum is limited at this point. but for example, pretty soon (in the
scheme of things) people are going to want to tell their bosses about
twisted. many of you seem to be fortunate to have (or be) bosses who are
willing to take a chance on a new framework. however, to clue in the PHBs
that so many of us have making decisions, a centralized, "user-friendly",
web-based forum could be much more accessible.

and there's more than pointy-haired-bosses who could benefit from this,
such as the beginning web developer/administrator who may not think on the
same level, but could really make use of an apache alternative. i'm sure
you're all familiar with the state of IT in businesses today; many a
webmaster is lucky to be able to, forgive the expression, walk and chew
gum at the same time.

i think the biggest reason it might be worth investigating is because as
much as twisted is progressing as a project, i can see it forming a
community of developers willing to, again, please forgive the cliche,
"think outside the box." i have seen mind-blowing levels of genius come
out of this group, so much so that i once made the statement to glyph, "i
want to help, but i feel like i'm just a programmer, and all you guys are
computer scientists."

i know what you mean about using the tools that are already available, but
i think that as twisted grows, if you want the more user-oriented (as in,
non-developer-oriented) parts to be accessible, a more user-oriented
approach might be helpful.

anyways, what it comes down to is this. i've been looking for a reason to
set up this forum software i'm really fond of on my machine, but i haven't
had a reason to do so yet. i'm going to go ahead and give it a try, and
you can check it out and see if you want to bother with it or not. if not,
no big deal, and if it seems interesting and not painful to use, then we
can investigate it further...

Not to further muddy the waters, but one reason I've been looking at 
Twisted was to port the software I wrote for Zope that runs at 
http://z.iwethey.org/forums -- we also have a hosting service. If you 
care to look around the site, the software gets extremely good reviews 
from the users with respect to the interface. It has full text indexing 
as well. With Twisted running behind it, I plan on integrating the 
forums with Jabber chat rooms, irc, and email.

I won't be porting it for at least a month or so, however (new baby in 
the house), but I fully intend on completing the project when I get the 
time.

Regards,
-scott

Did you try using help(internet.UDPServer) from the interactive interpreter?
Here's what I got:

class UDPServer(_AbstractServer)
 |  Serve UDP clients
 |
 |  Call listenUDP when the service starts, with the
 |  arguments given to the constructor. When the service stops,
 |  stop listening.

I checked in a fix to make it say "reactor.listenUDP" -- I guess it was
just a blindspot of me, I knew what listenUDP means :)
Anyway, this should not have required any "looking at the code".
Hopefully with my fix you'll be able to know you should do
help(reactor.listenUDP) to get the information you're after:

>>> help(reactor.listenUDP)
Help on method listenUDP in module twisted.internet.default:

listenUDP(self, port, protocol, interface='', maxPacketSize=8192) method of twis
ted.internet.default.SelectReactor instance
    Connects a given L{DatagramProtocol} to the given numeric UDP port.

I realize that the indirection is a pain, but it'd be somewhat annoying
(not impossible, though) to lose it, and I would prefer not to do it
unless it's a real deal breaker for someone.

In general, I highly recommend using help() from the interactive interpreter
to read the docstrings of stuff, and see how to call it. If this strategy
does not give you information for a specific method/class, you should
file a documentation bug in http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs -- while
ideally everything should have a docstring, the developers have so much
time, so prioritizing by stuff people need is a necessity.

You can always start using Stani's Python Editor SPE ( 
http://spe.pycs.net/ ) which automagically shows you the docstring and 
required parameterlist. ;-)

And with IPython it's even simpler, e.g. "help reactor.listenUDP".  
IPython does the parens for you, allowing for new heights of laziness. :)

If the docstrings aren't enough and you want to see the source after all, 
"psource reactor.listenUDP" shows you the source for just that single 
function, in pretty colors, even.

And you can't beat the tab completion: "reactor.listen<TAB>" shows you 
lots of interesting things.

Sure, it's slow to load, but IPython takes the interactive Python 
experience to a whole new level, especially in situations like this where 
you're exploring new (to you) code.

Oh yeah, try the @pdb option, which automatically launches the debugger 
*at the point of failure* when an uncaught exception occurs.  Alas, since 
the reactor catches all exceptions, this won't help much with Twisted apps.

I too love ipython :)  Especially since the deep reload command works 
fairly well.  Has macros too.  You can access the lines that you type in 
as a list.  Which makes getting a copy of code you type in there 
easier.  Oh and you can use !ls for shell commands.  More features at 
the website:

Have fun!

The question is not to use the ML OR the forum, but both of them. While
the Ml could be more "dev" oriented, the forum would help newbies to
find answers quicker than in the mailing list. Forums.gentoo.org and
gentoo-user or gentoo-dev mailings lists are a good exemple (there an
irc channel too). Forums.gentoo.org are very popular with their features
(categorize information, advanced search + highlight words, answers are
notified by mail, etc.).

I know Glyph don't want to hear about phpBB, because it's not written
using python&twisted. So, what's the solution ? Create a brand new forum
system using twisted ? Volonteers ? Roundup is quite good, and show the
right road. Twisted needs some killer apps.

I'm trying to manage my gentoo box with a twisted server (A linux
Distro). Portage is very slow, and build the package first level tree
can take several seconds. I just wanted my page not to block while
loading, and put the result in it when it becomes available.

The list of the category is in a "wmupdate_category(self, request)"
method, in which I'd like to use deferreds.

Thank you gurus for your help !

If you want to use phpbb I doubt anyone will boycott it. Again, anyone
who wants to can setup a forum. Roundup is not a twisted product, it's a
CGI.

Matthew,

A forum does not solve the core issue of organizing information
into a clear hierarchy of topics, filtering relevant questions
and answers, and a whole host of other items.  While a Wiki or
a Forum could be useful, it will only work if there are several
people who care about its structure, moderate it, and work
hard to make the information useful.   Other than that, threaded
email works just as well.  

IMHO, an AutoFAQ would be more appropriate, in particular, if you
or someone else dedicates significant _time_ to make sure that it
stays orderly and useful.   Sort of a AutoFAQ, you could simply
implement or edit a FAQ.  I'm sure if you kept one up-to-date 
it would glady find its way into the source code.

Probably a more "helpful" item would be a "Weekly Report" 
like the Python Developer's list has.  Some dutiful individual
there scans all of the things discussed, lists the topics
discussed, summarizes them into a single paragaraph and 
provides links to particularly insighful emails.  In my 
opinion, this would be far more useful..

I would love to see this happen! I used to do this waay back in the
day for Twisted, but I apparently don't have the focus to keep it up
(I only got 6 issues out). I would certainly *help* with such an
effort, now, as long as someone is willing to be responsible for it,
and can bug me when they need my help.

Here's an example of what I did, the 6th and final issue:

Yeah, that's a known glitch; the docs in the doc-latest directory aren't
generated with valid API links.  I've just checked in a change that will
make the doc-latest docs generate links to
    http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/TwistedDocs/current/...
which will fix the worst of the broken links (there are likely to still be
some, seeing as that is linking CVS howtos to the release version of the API
docs).

There's a seperate bug with the way links to top-level functions in modules
work (as opposed to classes and methods of classes) which means that
particular link will still not work for now.  It'll work when we do another
release, though, which is what matters.  doc-latest docs are just a preview
of the next release, after all, not the final product :)

Anyway, aside from that link, I take it you are happy with that FAQ entry? :)

-Andrew.

I liked those forums. Best of both worlds. It does have a slowness I attribute

I liked the mixed threads/flat-view that the forum uses. This is good for real

configure this better. If it is gets to be available on twisted, it would be 
good. However, I prefer to use lightweight systems; both in bandwidth and CPU.

You should put up an example setup, clean the CSS to the bare minimums. Put up 
a minimum of forums. I would think: Development, Twisted, Web

This brings up a sore point yet again - we need a documentation editor.

I'm still willing to do this, as per the mail here:
http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2003-October/006114.html

The four weeks has passed too. I'm not sure whether you were looking for
someone who has previously been involved in Twisted development though.

I'll have a look at the documentation and see what I think of it I
guess (I haven't read all of Twisted's documentation).

Yes, there are issues with how the database drivers work. I have to run 
it in single threaded mode or we get problems like lock-ups and 
corruption. :-P

Meh. It's a prototype. One that does half a million hits a month, but a 
prototype nonetheless.

If you were browsing without logging in, keep in mind that you were 
doing full forum scans. When you're logged in and have "Show New Only" 
turned on, things speed up considerably.

The views are also configurable by user. The interface has been beaten 
on and dissected by scores of computer professionals for years, all of 
whom know Exactly What They Want. :-)

The CSS was written before I knew what CSS was, and yes, it could stand 
a lot of improvement. :-)

There's a user option to turn CSS off completely. One of the main design 
goals was to allow anyone to use the forums: they work just as well in 
something like lynx or w3m.

Moving to Twisted is a priority, given the performance.

I would say that's probably not a requirement ;-). If you need me to
do anything, commit patches, update the web site, or whatever, please
ask. I'll try to be around to help for this task, specifically :)

Beggars can't be choosers!  Plus, I think you've got just the right 
amount of involvement with Twisted development - you clearly understand 
what's going on, but you haven't drunk enough of the kool-aid yet to be 
unable to see other approaches and make comparisons to other 
technologies.

As a way of getting a handle on this task, can people mail me offlist
with their understanding of what the current burning issues with the
documentation are, and with wishlist documentation issues too? That
includes documents that aren't written and should be and documents that
are written that need rewriting, as well as overview problems
("documents are poorly indexed" that kind of thing). Specific is better
though...

This will give me a way to start a todo list (oh, if there already is a
doc todo list, can someone tell me where it is?) that would be
considerably faster than doing a initial full review of the docs myself.
In the meantime, I'll have a look at roundup and see what I can do about
using it to keep track of doc bugs/wishlist items (I don't know whether
this would overwhelm the bug tracker with documentation bugs).

I'll summarise for the list in about a week. If you'd prefer me not to
quote your email, please let me know, otherwise I'll assume people are
OK with their responses to this mail being quoted.

I'm a fairly pedantic, obsessive-compulsive freak when it comes to
grammar and spelling freak, but we have had some conflicts regarding

I prefer to use the 'nomail' option to the mailing list (so i can post) 
and use gmane's nntp via mozilla thunderbird to read.  The web interface 
also allows for dearching posts.  Keeps my inbox from getting too 
cluttered, but I have easy access to all of the mailing list (even from 
before I signed up to it) in a nice threaded format.

Are you sure your code is even being triggered? Since your code isn't
writing out those HTML tags anywhere, it seems like some completely
different resource is being renderred instead of yours. Can you put
some debug prints in "render" and "printResult"?

Also, Mozilla and IE I think both will say "<html><body></body></html>" even
when nothing was sent.  Try testing with telnet or wget...

Yes, I think Mozilla is the source for the "<html><body></body></html>"
string.  I don't think anything is being sent.  If I put a request.finish()
in "render" then the resource returns any data written to request in
"render" (but not "printResult").  I'm guessing that the connection with the
client gets closed before a request is rendered.

Is anyone aware of any examples of web applications written in twisted that
uses a database to store dynamic elements?  Thats ultimately where I'm
trying to get with this.  Thanks for the responses.

-Charles.

I added some print debug statements as follows:

def printResult(data, request):
    print "entered printResult"
    request.write("pre-data")
    request.write(data)
    request.write("post-data")
    request.finish()
    print request
    return server.NOT_DONE_YET

class myResource(resource.Resource):
    def render(self, request):
        print "entered render"
        d = getData("some string")
        d.addCallback(printResult, request)
        print "after callback"
        return server.NOT_DONE_YET

resource = myResource()

which results in the following logs being generated:

2003/11/15 19:49 PST [HTTPChannel,13,<ip>] entered render
2003/11/15 19:49 PST [HTTPChannel,13,<ip>] after callback

What is 'data' here? can you print repr(data)? It might be the empty
string, or something.

This is unnecessary here, FYI.

2003/11/15 20:43 PST [-] entered printResult
2003/11/15 20:43 PST [-] ((13L, 'Hawaii', 'HI', 'US'),)

Seems like the request might be different from the original, or doesn't have
a channel to respond on?

For completeness, Christopher pointed out that I was not passing a string to
request.write (str(data)).  Since I did not have an Errback call, the
exception that was raised in the callback was never output.  (fixed by
adding: d.addErrback(log.err)  )

Thanks for the help!

Thanks for your helpful reply.  I had looked at the web documentation
and interactive help however I evidently have a blind spot for the very
first sentence. :)  I repeatedly skimmed down to the function I am interested
in and saw:

__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)

Not being able to find out what these arguments were *right there* in the
documentation I immediately just checked the code.  This didn't take
long at all of course just annoying.  I then ran into the same issue
with one of the other server classes and figured I must be missing
something.  Turns out I was evidently literally missing something 
in the documentation.  :)

So far though Twisted is a great system.  Thanks for your work and
reply.

Philipp,
thanks for your info and efforts.

I am currently working on a Project using Plone 2.0 for which I need a visual 
editor.
Since the project is due by the end of the year, I need to use a solution that 
is available by then. 
My question therefore is:what is the state of the plone integration?
Is there something I could use to start with?

I would very much like to help beta testing, but it must be in an Plone 
environment.

Message-ID: <20031117191929.B0D6141510@server1.messagingengine.com>

Working with fzZzy on #divmod, I made the following change to my local
twisted/web/woven/flashconduit.py to make LivePage work for me.  I'm
using guard sessions (which appear to not be supported by the current
code) so in my case the sessions are stored on the SessionWrapper.  I
really don't know squat about the way the code should be, so hopefully
someone else can take a look at this and apply a real patch.  I'd gladly
do the real thing, but it would take me a *lot* longer to do.  :-)

Thanks.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] model question
Message-ID: <000001c3ad43$3cdf7f40$687ba8c0@vicky>

I have a web based application.
 
I want to create a model from a sql query that will be accessible from
the web page.
I want to be able to create my model in the setUp fonction.
I also want to access my model from the web page like this:
model="plan_id" (where plan_id is a column from my sql query)
 
I don't know if someone understand what I want.
 
Here's a part of my class:
 
class SummaryDB:
    """PublisherDB Class"""
    def __init__(self, dbpool):
        self.dbpool = dbpool
 
    def getSummary(self, plan_id):
        sql = "select * from plan where plan_id = '%s'" %plan_id
        return self.dbpool.runQueryDict(sql)
 
class SummaryPage(pages.BasePage):
    templateFile = "summary.html"
    
    def initialize(self, dbpool):
        self.dbpool = dbpool
        self.db = SummaryDB(self.dbpool)
            
    def setUp(self, request, *args):
        # I want to do somethings like :
        # self.model = ({'details' : self.db.getSummary(plan_id)}
        # and then, access to details by my web page
        self.contextMenu = menus.build_search_menu()
 
    
And here's my template:
 
<html>
            <head>
                        <title>
                                    Title 
                        </title>
            </head>
            <body>
                        <br />
                        <table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="1"

                                    <tr>

                                                </td>

Why don't you use a wmfactory_details ?
I don't understand why you want to put it in the setUp method :(

this is actually the first time i've ever written a PB client in python.
since my java client was calling the remote methods out of the awt/swing
event thread, i never had to deal with this particular issue. while i'm
waiting for the update to the java pb packages (*cough*itamar*cough* ;-)
), i figured it would be worthwhile to do up a text-based client in
python.

i know this relates to my poor understanding of deferreds, but i just
can't figure out exactly how to go about doing what i want to do.

i want to be able to continually prompt the user for a string that gets
sent to a "parse" method on the remote object. i'm not exactly sure the
right way to do this. do I just add a callback to the deferred returned by

def main():
    config = Options()
    if(config['login'] == None):
        config['login'] = getpass.getuser()
    passwd = getpass.getpass("%s@%s's password: " % (config['login'],

Calling raw_input is a bad idea.  It will block.

You should either use twisted.internet.stdio (which is probably more work
than you care to do -- but see doc/examples/cursesclient.py for an example
that uses stdio and curses to make a simple irc client), or run raw_input in
a thread:


from twisted.internet import threads

def connected(perspective):
    deferred = threads.deferToThread(raw_input, "> ")
    deferred.addCallback(lambda cmd: perspective.callRemote("parse", cmd))
    deferred.addCallback(lambda res: connected(perspective))


Note that perspective.callRemote will return a Deferred -- but that's ok,
the Deferreds automatically cope with (i.e. wait for) deferred results from
callbacks :)

Something else to notice is that Deferreds pass the result of the previous
callback (or the original result, for the first callback) to each callback,
which is why I wrote:
    deferred.addCallback(lambda res: connected(perspective))
rather than your:
    defer.addCallback(connected)

Hi all,

I probably shouldn't be too surprised, but I'm experiencing
some odd behaviour with IE 6.0 .vs. Mozilla 1.5, both on
Windows XP.

I've developed a Woven application that generates three
HTML pages, let's call them A, B, and C.

A's render() method does a redirect to B. B's view methods
generate an XHTML meta tag with the content attribute set
to a refresh and new URL for C:

     <meta content="10;http://example.org/C" http-equiv="refresh" />

With Mozilla as the client everything thing goes as I expected
with pages progressing from A to B to C.

With IE as the client it goes from A to B, then loops continually
on B, i.e A, B, B, B, ... without ever reaching C.

I suspect there's some request header I need to set or set
differently?  Can anyone offer me advice on this strange
situation?


Cheers,

Stu

Message-ID: <20574562.20031118085501@email.it>

In my application I have a server that listens on a UNIX socket.
When I kill the application, the socket file remains in the filesystem
so  when  I  restart  it  I always achieve an "Address already in use"
error.

Should  I  delete  it  manually  any time I stop the application or is
there a more elegant way to solve this problem?

The application is a plugin for twistd.

Thank you in advance.

I'm guessing you're using 1.1?
It's fixed in CVS, so when there is a new release, it will be fixed.
I'm not sure what your best course of action, though:
* Live with it, and wait for new release
* Move to CVS, wait for new release to move back to released version
* Implement some work around, wait for new release to remove it

I'm sorry there aren't better news than "it was a bug, we fixed it" --
twisted.application is quite a bit of code, and testing in the field
frequently finds more bugs. You can rest assured that the bug was
not merely fixed, but a unit test added to make sure it doesn't
come back.

I will take option number 1.
If I'm not wrong, in version 1.0.7 this error didn't appear.

That's good, thank you: I will wait for next release.

That sounds likely.  twisted.application, and the associated changes to
twistd and other infrastructure, were new to 1.1.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] win32eventreactor bug?
Message-ID: <20031118151402.43857400DF@server1.messagingengine.com>

I was running twistd on windows, serving out a custom tap which is just a
web app and a pb service.  As it was doing it's thing, suddenly a ton of
output started dumping on the log.  Did I find a bug in the win32 event
reactor, or am I hitting some sort of limit?  I can send some code along
if necessary, but nothing in the log looks specific to my code.

Thanks.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] new ftp implementation
Message-ID: <3FBA5F25.4070506@twistedmatrix.com>

Hello all,

Just wanted to announce there is a new version of the ftp server/protocol.

the new protocol:

   - Supports cred, so you can control/abstract the filesystem
   - includes an anonymous-only avatar/realm
   - supports pipelining of commands
   - intentionally does not support globbing (to help prevent security
     holes)
   - connection limiting (ex. max 100 users)
   - individual timeouts for protocol interpreter idle time and dtp
     connection times

todos:
   - the permissions-checking needs improvement. I intend to set up an
     option on the FTPFactory that will let you set the uid of the
     anonymous user, but that's coming in the next week.
   - path purification code needs improvement (to prevent intentionally 	
     stupid paths like "\\//*/*/../../*/.." from borking the server)
   - a couple of other minor odds-and-ends


there's an example tac file in sandbox/slyphon/ftp_refactor/ftpsrv.tac

comments, suggestions, etc. welcomed

one more note, as of right now, the avatar i've implemented will only 
work on linux/unix (specifically platforms that support python's pwd and 
grp modules). patches for win32 would be greatly appreciated! :)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] SOAP client for Twisted
Message-ID: <20031118152003.A985@cutter.rexx.com>

I've added minimal SOAP client support to Twisted.

I did it by copying a bit of code from twisted/web/xmlrpc.py and by
using some of the functionality from SOAPpy and adding it to
twisted/web/soap.py.

I've tested it lightly and it seems to work.

Is this of interest to the Twisted project?

If so, let me know and I'll send it along.

Someone who knows Twisted better than I will have to look at the
code to make sure that, given the way I implemented it, it does not
block.

Dave

Yes indeed, please add a patch to

adding patches to twisted implies giving copyright to glyph for the copy

The win32eventreactor is limited to 64 objects, so that might be what's
causing the error.

OK, some results of this and later discussion is at
http://twistedmatrix.com/users/roundup.twistd/twisted/issue397

I've assigned a bunch of unclaimed doc bugs in the bug tracker to myself
(hypatia), and people can assign doc bugs to me if they like. I will try
and take responsibility at least for finding someone else to do them
otherwise they will go in what will probably turn out to be quite a long
list of docs to be written by me.

The first item I am likely to look at is an overall guide to the
documentation, probably with sub-topics ("multi-protocol applications
with Twisted", "web development with Twisted" and so on).

There's also a bit of demand for an overview of asynch network
programming and related docs on Deferreds assuming only the knowledge
given in such an overview. This is important but is not high on my own
todo list because I'm not an expert so if anyone wants to produce those
that would be excellent.

If you have comments, feel free to contact me on this list, by email
off-list, or on IRC, probably in that order of preference if you want me
to add stuff to a todo list (I'm terrible at using IRC as a todo list).

Message-ID: <3FBB5B27.5030809@brainbot.com>

Hi all,

I would like to integrate the PerspectiveBorker into a 
platform-independant GUI.
If I use Delphi for example, I include the twisted-reactor via the 
Python Deplhi Interface.
But then if I call "reactor.run()" this blocks the Delphi Application!
Since wxPython for is not supported for Windows yet, and I do not want 
to use GTK or PyGui, my question is:
How can I integrate the twisted framework into a GUI environment such as 
Delphi?
Or do I have to use Java?
Can I run the reactor in another thread?

regards,

Thorsten

Of course, simulating the reactor via a wxTimer (as seen on ASPN) does 
work, but the latest twisted says, wxsupport is not fully supported on

ouch ! 

I haven't seen this demo, but I think it's quite old. try this instead :

http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/203471


(your warning came from twisted, not wxpython)

and here is the killing tip of the day :

Hope it will help !

In woven, html elements are automatically given an id (eg. <div

have a div tag I'm trying to using to dump error logs into on the fly
with LivePage and display them to the user.  It seems that I cannot
reference a tag by name with javascript, so I need access to the
auto-generated id.  If I had the id I could do something similar to the
example below.

Does anyone know if it's possible to lookup this id in woven?

Thanks.

The best way to do it is to provide your own ID. When you add an id 
attribute to a
node, woven will refrain from overwriting it with an auto-generated one.

Did you try twisted.web.lmx or twisted.web.microdom ? These packages wil help
you to modify the dom tree. (lmx can modify the rendered tree, and  microdom 
the template tree, if i'm right).

You want to integrate the Delphi event loop with the Twisted event loop.
This will involve either a custom reactor, or something like what
twisted.internet.wxsupport or tksupport do.

  Cool.  The clock is an hour fast, it seems (or maybe it just doesn't know
about daylight savings time.  I could hardly blame it), and there are a
couple other minor annoyances (I really wanted to see my name as "last
registered user"!  Oh well, it's only PHP *wink*), but cool.

  I thought I might suggest some other sections to create, but I think I'll
just wait and see what people use it for.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] looking for twisted Tkinter documentation
Message-ID: <02f301c3aecf$cdb35090$a90a500a@jsbwxp3>

Hi, I found the following at
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/choosing-reactor#auto16:

-----
Tkinter
The support for Tkinter doesn't use a specialized reactor. Instead, there is
some specialized support code:
from Tkinter import *
from twisted.internet import tksupport

root = Tk()
root.withdraw()

# Install the Reactor support
tksupport.install(root)

An example Twisted application that uses Tk can be found in
twisted/words/ui/tkim.py.
-----

But I didn't find it in either the twisted or TwistedDocs directories in my
Python 2.3 site-packages directory. The copyright,.py on my twisted
installation shows twisted version 1.1.0.

I also had a look at the examples index in
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/examples/#auto8 and found links to uses
of qt, wx, gtk2 and curses, but nothing about Tkinter.

Having loaded up on Tkinter books on the strength of the assertion that
Tkinter is the standard, most cross-platform GUI for Python, I'm
understandably anxious to use it with twisted. I'm writing a socket server
that needs to both respond to incoming client requests and occasionally send
unsolicited messages to the client based on Tkinter button presses and timer
expirations.

I was originally going use some lower-level Python modules, but I was
intrigued by the stylistic and software engineering claims of twisted,
especially the use of aspect-oriented programming as a tool for managing
unrelated complexities, so I'm going to try to dive into twisted a little
deeper before giving up and heading back to the shallow end of the pool.
Thanks in advance for any information that will help me integrate Tkinter
with twisted.

P.S. I found the itamarst.org tutorials (formidavel!) and am working my way
through them.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Python a post-Object Oriented Language?
Message-ID: <035201c3aede$10464800$a90a500a@jsbwxp3>

Hi, I saw the above characterization in one of the itamarst.org twisted presentation slides. Although I'm just a journeyman programmer and somewhat unaccustomed to the rarefied atmosphere of many twisted Python discussions, I'm curious to hear why Python would be "post-OOP".

If I recall correctly, my little O'Reilly C++ book said that OOP meant you had 4 things (abstraction, encapsulation, hierarchy and something else that escapes me at the moment, maybe "coolness"). I also recall that compiled C++ had a hard time doing the neat tricks that an interpreted language can do and was necessarily limited by its origin as a preprocessor step in front of a classic C compiler. There were some minor differences like automatic constructor chaining in C++, as opposed to manual __init__ chaining in Python. There were some major differences like being able to dynamically set attributes on an object, and the replacement of data hiding by convention in Python.

Given that background, I'm just curious to hear the grounds on which Python can be classified as post-OOP. Any comments?

Fortunately or unfortunately, there's no single, one, common
definition for OOP. There is wide disparity in featuresets among
languages which are commonly held to be object-oriented.

Jonathan Rees gives us a nice catalog of some of the features
typically associated with OO here:

http://paulgraham.com/reesoo.html

In what respect is Python "post-OO"? Well, you could say that a
language which combines OO features with nice first class functions
and list comprehensions, while eliminating some of the Java cruft, is
"post-OO". But you could say the same for CLOS, or Self, which are 20
and 15 years old respectively, predating the widespread adoption of OO
by a good many years. So, maybe Python is "pre-OO"?

Here's an article in American Scientist alledging the existence of a
post-OO paradigm, including XP, aspects, and design patterns:

Message-ID: <FAEF90BE-1AE2-11D8-B544-003065B25CAA@intersight.com>

I have a two-screen mini test application.  Each screen has a page.Page 
subclass and a template associated with the page.Page.   Let's call 
them welcomePage and nextPage.  welcomePage.html has a form whose 
action is "nextPage."  WelcomePage has a wchild_nextPage() method which 
returns an instance of NextPage.

When welcomePage's form is submitted, WelcomePage's wchild_nextPage() 
gets called twice.  The first time it gets called with the expected 
request args, the second time the request args dictionary is empty.

Obviously I'm doing something wrong, but what?

Pages by default redirect so they have a / at the end. So you submit to
http://foo/nextPage and that gets redirected to http://foo/nextPage/.

Solutions:
1. submit to /nextPage/ from the start.
2. set addSlash=0 on NextPage.

    Many thanks for pointing that out.  Unfortunately it makes no
    difference to the behaviour with IE or Mozilla.  I've since tried
    with Opera 7 and it goes into the endless loop too, which makes
    me think there's a problem with the (X)HTML my Woven pages are
    generating and Mozilla is being very forgiving.

    I've tried adding the equivalent HTTP headers to the request
    headers in Woven and also run the generated XHTML through the
    W3C validator.  It reported a couple of errors with some
    <tr> attributes but nothing about the <meta> elements.

    This is the generated XHTML <head>:

I think this change introduces a race condition.  It's possible for a thread
to call callFromThread between the end of the for loop and the del
statement.

(callFromThread is defined as:
    def callFromThread(self, f, *args, **kw):
        """See twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorThreads.callFromThread.
        """
        assert callable(f), "%s is not callable" % f
        if threadable.isInIOThread():
            self.callLater(0, f, *args, **kw)
        else:
            # lists are thread-safe in CPython, but not in Jython
            # this is probably a bug in Jython, but until fixed this code
            # won't work in Jython.
            self.threadCallQueue.append((f, args, kw))
            self.wakeUp()
)

So I think it's possible to lose thread calls.  I *think* this patch will
fix it, but more eyeballs are always welcome with threaded code:

  That looks a little more complex than it needs to be.  What about this
version?


    def runUntilCurrent(self):
        """Run all pending timed calls.
        """
        if self.threadCallQueue:
            calls, self.threadCallQueue = self.threadCallQueue, []
            for (f, a, kw) in calls:               
                try:
                    f(*a, **kw)
                except:
                    log.err()

  I considered doing it this way first, but wasn't sure if anyone relied on
the identity of threadCallQueue (not that anyone should, but one never
knows).  If anyone thinks changing its identity should be avoided, I'd like
this version:

    def runUntilCurrent(self):
        """Run all pending timed calls.
        """
        if self.threadCallQueue:
            calls = self.threadCallQueue[:]
            del self.threadCallQueue[:]
            for (f, a, kw) in calls:
                try:
                    f(*a, **kw)
                except:
                    log.err()


  I suppose reverting it entirely is an option, seeing as how no one has yet
*actually* been bitten by the quadratic behavior (nor does it seem likely
that anyone will be), but all other things equal, it's nicer to use O(N)
algorithms deep down in the guts of Twisted than to use O(N**2) algorithms.

Yeah, that looks ok too, I think.  I'm less certain though... is it possible
for this to happen:

     reactor thread                 other thread
     --------------                 ------------
                                    call callFromThread
                                      ...get reference to self.threadCallQueue
     call runUntilCurrent
       ...set self.tCQ to a new list
       ...do for loop
                                      ...append to now old threadCallQueue

So that again, a call can go missing?  Hmm, I think this is possible, so
that version is also bad.  It's also harder to reason about than my patch --
I had to disassemble it to help me think about it :)

That's definitely racy!  What if the call to callFromThread happens between
the "calls = ..." and the del statement?

A version which does
    calls = self.threadCallQueue[:]
    del self.threadCallQueue[:len(calls)]

Should be ok though, for the same reason my patch is (or at least I think it
is :)

The main difference between that version and my is this one involves a small
list copy, but it might still be faster than executing "count += 1" on every
loop iteration.  Either way, it's at the point where I don't care :)

I think I'd like to see it improved to have O(N) complexity too.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Woven View factories: defered rendering?
Message-ID: <20031120032041.GA11694@pasternak.w.lub.pl>

Hi,

I have a webpage, that is rendered via twisted.web.woven.page.Page class.

In one of it's wvfactory_ methods, I need to send an e-mail. I would also
like to check if sending of the e-mail was successful (eg. mailserver is
up, running, and reachable via network).

I thought about something like this:

  def wvfactory_render(self, req, node, model):
      # do some stuff 
      sendEMail().addCallbacks(self.emailOkay, self.emailFailure)
      return # what should I return here?
      
  def emailOkay(self, *args):
      # render "thank you, e-mail sent" message 
      
  def emailFailure(self, *args):
      # render "error" message
      
My questions:
   1) is it a good, Twisted Python way to do this? If not,
      a) what would be the correct one? 
      b) can you point me to some docs?
   2) if it is a good way:
      a) is it implemented? if yes:
      	 1) what should I return from wvfactory_render? 
	 2) what parameters would be passed to callbacks then?
      b) if not, do you think it would be worth implementing?
      
I have seen something similar like the thing I want to code in some example
sources:

       def render(...):
       	   [ launch some callbacks ] 
	   return server.NOT_DONE_YET
  
... but they were about Resource class, and I'm using Page here.

Anyone?

Hi,

I know its been a while, but the project I needed this for has
gone on the back burner. I was going to do an example for
how I got the file to send and then do a recieve. I haven't got
around to it. So for posterity and for anyone else who hits the
same problem here is the modified ftp example that shows
how I uploaded a file using twisted. The answer was in the unit
tests I'd just forgotten twisted had them.

All the best,

om

Message-ID: <fc.005b8dcc029335ea005b8dcc029335ea.29336b9@samson.shu.ac.uk>

Hi,

This may well be a very trivial question but i have been trying to get the UDP
multicasting example in the "how to" section of the twisted documentation to
work and have had no success. I can do TCP message and normal UDP but cant
multicast it.

It does not report any errors but nothing every seems to be received by the
echo server.
Don't I need to explicitly join the multicast group at any point?

The code i have been using is as follows:
The multicast client:

from twisted.internet.protocol import DatagramProtocol
from twisted.internet import reactor
class Client(DatagramProtocol): 
	def datagramReceived(self, data, host):
	 	print 'Response Recieved:', data.strip()
		print 'From Host:', host
reactor.listenUDP(0, Client()).write('broadcast\n', ('224.0.0.1', 9999))
reactor.run() 

The original Echo server:

from twisted.internet.protocol import DatagramProtocol
from twisted.internet import reactor
class Echo(DatagramProtocol):
	def datagramReceived(self, data, (host, port)):
		print "received %r from %s:%d" % (data, host, port)
		self.transport.write(data, (host, port))
reactor.listenUDP(9999, Echo())
reactor.run() 

Thanks for any help,
Alan.

As I am a very, very lazy man, I'd like to hear from at least one Twisted
developer, that it's currently impossible (or unwise to do that) before
trying to implement such functionality.

... and I wonder if it's different for nevow.

Well, it's possible to do if you are willing to do some legwork
yourself.  If you override the render method of your Page, you can
manually handle waiting for the Deferred stuff to finish, because in a
Resource's render you can return NOT_DONE_YET and then call
request.finish() at a later time.  I've done that successfully. 

nevow handles all this stuff much more smoothly.  I wouldn't put a lot
of work into extending woven. 

b.g.

When will nevow will be considered as stable enough ? I won't create an entire 
app using woven if it's going to be depracated in 1 month :(
Btw, could you send us a  concrete example of what you were talking about ?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Mixmaster Architecture
Message-ID: <12452-02919@sneakemail.com>


Here's an architecture question for Twisted Matrix gurus.
I need to implement a "mixmaster" scheme, as follows:

                           |--> Remote client A
        UDP            TCP |
Server <---> Mixmaster <---|--> Remote client B
                           |
                           |--> Remote client C
                           |
                           ... (etc.)

Here is the background data:

Server <---> mixmaster is a custom binary protocol
over UDP transport.

Mixmaster <---> clients is custom protocol(s)
over TCP transport.  The most important client type
uses Telnet (raw).

Server and mixmaster script live on the same PC.
Remote clients have individual IPs and MACs.

Server is closed-source Java; I cannot change it.
Server's UDP communications is stock Java from Sun.
Clients are different closed-source systems (not PCs).
Mixmaster script is my Python.  How to architect it?

The Mixmaster script needs to multiplex communications
between clients and server.  The server will think it's
talking to N clients, all of which know its peculiar
protocol.  It's OK for the server to believe they have
the same IP address 127.0.0.1.  There is other identifying
information in the server protocol to distinguish the
clients (including MACs and device name strings).

I have an idea how to proceed, but still would like to
hear your advice, and thank you for it.

Mark

Woven has some, ahem, object identity issues. It really, really wants 
you to return an actual View instance from a wvfactory_. However, it 
does support deferreds being returned from the Widget.generate method. 
A deferred callback should mutate the incoming template node in place 
in order to cause some changes to the final page:

class MyDeferredWidget(widgets.Widget):
	def generate(self, request, node):
		theDeferred = doSomeAction()
		def theCallback(result):
			node.appendChild(
				request.d.createTextNode("the result was: %s" % result)
			)
		theDeferred.addCallback(theCallback)
		return theDeferred


class MyPage(page.Page):
	template = """<html><span view="theDeferredThing" /></html>"""

	def wvfactory_theDeferredThing(self, request, node, model):
		return MyDeferredWidget(model)


This is completely untested, but it gives you an idea of what to do. 
One of the main reasons for embarking upon nevow was that I knew a lot 
more about Deferreds than when I wrote woven, and woven's architecture 
made it very difficult to support deferreds properly. In nevow, the 
code might look like:


class MyPage(renderer.Renderer):
	def render_doSomeAction(self, context, data):
		return doSomeAction().addCallback(
			lambda result: "The result was: %s" % result)

	document = html[
	span[
		render_doSomeAction
	]
]

The point is nevow was designed from the beginning to handle Deferreds 
more gracefully than woven was. Also, because the paradigm in nevow 
sticks far better to "the return value of a callable replaces whatever 
came in" than woven ended up doing, it's impossible to get into funny 
identity situations where you're mutating an object but you don't see 
the result of it in the final page, because you were mutating a copy 
and it was the wrong object.

Bleh. My bad (well, and Pahan's). You want to use listenMulticast,
really, and you need to join() a group. See twisted.internet.interfaces
- the multicast stuff, and twisted.test.test_udp. I will remove the
offending docs.

No this is the wrong picture. Here's a right picture:

           |<--|              |--> Remote client A
        UDP|   |          TCP |
Server <---|<--|Mixmaster<----|--> Remote client B
           |   |              |
           |<--|              |--> Remote client C
           |   |              |
                             ... (etc.)

so you'll want something like

class MixmasterProtocol(protocol.Protocol) # the TCP side

    def connectionMade(self):
        self.udp = p = protocol.ConnectedDatagramProtocol()
        p.datagramReceived = self.datagramReceived
        self.server = reactor.connectUDP('127.0.0.1', PORT, p)

    def connectionLost(self):
        self.server.stopListening()

    def dataReceived(self, data):
        pass # handle data from TCP client, maybe use self.udp.transport.write

    def datagramReceived(self, data):
        pass # handle data from server, maybe use self.transport.write
 
> The most important client type uses Telnet (raw).

Make up your mind, telnet or raw? a Line-based protocol?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] wvfactory
Message-ID: <000001c3afaa$24c8b3e0$687ba8c0@vicky>

I have a form in a web page and I need to fill it with many sql queries
but only the first time the page is rendered.  
The other times, I want to fill it with the data from request.args.
 
I decided to build a dictionnary that looks like the dictionnary of
request.args to be able to use only one function to validate and fill my
form.
My function that fill my forms need to receive the dictionnary, the
document(node that I need to change) and a signature (signature is a
list of the name and the type of each elements from the form that need
to be fill).
 
In my template, I defined a wmfactory in the tag <form> that return my
dictionnary.  Ive also define a wvfactory that call my function to fill
the form.
The problems is that wmfactory return a deferred so in wvfactory I have
to call my function to fill like this:  return
model.getData(request).addCallback(my function).  But I think that
return doesnt wait that the addCallback is done.
 
Is there something I can do to make my returns wait for the addCallback
to return the new node filled with the dictionnary of data.
 
Heres a part of my code:
 
#verify is the function that fill and verify my form
class handle:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def verify(self, dict, doc, signature):
        # dict is the dictionnary from the sql queries of the
request.args
        # doc is the node <form> and its child
        error = 0
        for item in signature:
            nodeList = domhelpers.locateNodes(doc, 'name', item[0])
            #INTEGER, FLOAT and STRING
            if item[1] == 'integer' or item[1] == 'float' or item[1] ==
'string':
                pass
            #CHECKBOX
            elif item[1] == 'checkbox':
                for node in nodeList:
                    # dict est None s'il n'est pas cochee
                    if dict.get(item[0]) != None and
str(node.getAttribute('value')) in dict.get(item[0]):
                        print 'checked'
                        node.setAttribute('checked', 'checked')
                        print node
                    else:
                        if item[2] == 'true':
                            error = 1
                            l = microdom.lmx(node)

Message-ID: <10349-59812@sneakemail.com>


Thank you Moshe Zadka.  What you're saying is that TCP
connections can trigger ephemeral UDP pseudo-connections.

The server communicates over just one UDP port, and data
flow is bidirectional at all points in the chain.  I'm not
sure whether these facts affect the suggestion here.
The mixmaster opens its own assigned UDP port to receive
data from the server, as well as sending data to the
server over another UDP port.

> Make up your mind, telnet or raw? a Line-based protocol?

You're right, I should.  Here is the scoop.  For manual
device tests I'm using PuTTY in its "raw" mode.  That is
the origin of "raw."  Basically the telnet sessions are
line-based command/response activity.  The devices don't
utilize the full telnet protocol, just a small subset.

The terms "client" and "server" may be mixed up, from a
networking standpoint.  These are just conventions in the
legacy software, right or wrong.  The original authors
called the Java app a server, and the devices clients. 
However the devices supply information that the Java app
requests of them.  So the actual roles are reversed.

Normally, when talking to devices that know its protocol,
the system is very simple.  Here's how it works without a
mixmaster script.  The server initiates communications. 
The server broadcats a public query packet, and devices
respond with their names and technical features.  The
server constructs a list of known devices.  From there, the
server invokes various device capabilities.  When finished,
the server shuts down the devices.

Why the mixmaster?  Many devices offer identical
capabilites, but don't know the server's protocol.  The
mixmaster allows the server to use them.

My apologies for confusing terminology and my thanks for
your answers.

Mark

This is different. I believe twisted is responsible for the error report.  
It actually did, but for some reason it made itself fall into a dead loop.
I would like to call this bug, and encountered this when I play with
producer, consumer, etc. ( resumeProducing() is startReading!) I wish 
someone could fix this. Thanks.

You didn't make it clear that you actually considered this a
bug. Please post it to http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/ -- and please
include the errors that happen, etc, and any suggestions for
fixes. Thanks.

  startReading() is not a public API.

I'm running Python 2.3 on Windows 2000 version 5.00.2195 Service Pack 4 and
having trouble running the Twisted-1.1.0.win32-py2.3.exe installation.

I downloaded the .exe to a local folder, got to the Install button, clicked
on it and while the "Saving uninstall information" message was displayed but
before the progress bar showed any progress, I got a Setup message box
saying "CreateFile failed; code 5. Access is denied"

Can anyone tell me what code 5 means?

I've got 112 MB left on the C: drive, I hope that's not the problem.

I don't have a Windows installation to play with anymore, so this is just a
guess...

Mysterious installation errors are often due to installing Twisted and/or
Python as a non-Adminstrator.   Perhaps that's the problem here?

Both of them are slightly unaccurate. I'll update my slides for the next
time I give the tutorial to be consistent.

Well, you may be in luck. I've just re-written the ftp protocol for 
twisted. if you want an example of how to set one up, you can look (in 
the cvs version of twisted) at sandbox/slyphon/ftpsrv.tac.

You'll need to make some local edits (such as what you want your 
root/tld to be) but you can get a feel for how it can be done.

please note, the ftp server implementation is *very* *new*.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] tap2ntsvc future
Message-ID: <3FC00B0F.10703@twistedmatrix.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I've finished the initial work on tap2ntsvc.  This script does the
tedious work of creating an installer around your Twisted service.  A
quick howto:

1. Create a tap or tac file for your application, using the method you
normally use.  **Test with twistd to make sure that you can start the
app from the command line, _before_ you wrap a service around it.**

2. Acquire and install the prerequisites of tap2ntsvc.  It depends on
software outside of Twisted, specifically:
win32all @ http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/Downloads.html
Innoconda @ http://twistedmatrix.com/~moonfallen/innoconda.html

3. Run tap2ntsvc from the command line.  (*This is not yet integrated
with the "Twisted Command Prompt" available on MSWindows with the
official Twisted installer, but it will be when the script becomes an
official part of Twisted.) Use --help to get the command line options.
To start with, all you need to provide is the name of your tap or tac file.
| python .../Twisted/sandbox/moonfallen/tap2ntsvc myapp.tac
This will build an installable package using Innoconda.

4. Install the package.  It will be in myappsvc/myapp-...-setup.exe.

5. Start the service; it will fail, but you'll find out what modules you
need to add.
| net start myapp
**It's ok if this doesn't work.**

6. Check the Application event log to find out what modules failed to
import; you will be re-running py2exe after you add the missing modules.

7. Either: (a) re-run tap2ntsvc with the -i option or (b) add your
modules to myappsvc/setup.cfg on the "includes=" line.  If you choose to
do the latter, read myappsvc/README.txt to find out how to recompile
just the parts you need.

8. Redo steps 3 through 7 until you no longer get ImportErrors in the
Application log.

9. Some applications need data files.  If you need data files in your
application, consult myappsvc/README.txt and edit myappsvc/myapp.fms.
myapp.fms uses a special command language to make adding data files as
intuitive as possible.  You can put files in c:\Program Files\myapp or
any subdirectory thereof, so make sure your application code can find
data files there.

When you're done, you should be able to 'net start myapp' successfully.
~   When you want to rebuild it in the future, just keep these files in
your version control:
~  myappsvc/do_inno_script.py
~           do_inno.py
~           setup.cfg
~           setup.py
~           myapp.fms

Caveats, bugs, TODO:
- - you must be able to start your application in py2exe.  Things most
likely to not work are finding important data files based on the value
of __file__ in some module.
- - if you install the same service multiple times without uninstalling it
in between installs, then start it, then uninstall it, it will crash on
uninstall.  Just be sure to uninstall it in between installs while
you're experimenting.
- - I want to make the module finder more foolproof, saving several of the
steps above.  This is a non-trivial problem, however.
- - Really, it needs a frontend.  And I hate Tk.  Can I put a Gtk app into
~ Twisted proper? :-)


The future:
I want to move tap2ntsvc out of sandbox and into main Twisted.  I want
people to read this email over and try it before I do so, in case there
are important concerns I need to address.  We need to give some thought
to what to do about the 2 significant dependencies.  Should this block
tap2ntsvc from being in Twisted proper?  Is there a policy for this sort
of thing?

The wxsupport is broken, no matter which platform. That's why I invented the 
timer thing on ASPN. Wxsupport will fail the moment you open a modal dialog 
(or use a pulldown menu, which also is a modal). Probably there will never be 
a real reactor, well - unless someone with a lot of knowledge of both twisted 
and wxpython writes one. The problem is that wx - being platform independent 
uses the native event-loop, which behaves differently on windows, gtk or 
whatever. So a reactor would have to take care of that. The timer recipe 
works nicely though.

Short question,
which is the adecuate way of doing unit test of a sequence of defered events ? one chained to the other.

If each deferred need a callback method, I have already more that thirty functiones defined, and each time I need more.

How to do it ?

defered = something

<the magic>

defered = the_next_thing # that need the previous defered to have been acomplished

etc...

I can imagine various tricks, but I supose there is a standart way. 

Thanks.

    from twisted.trial import unittest

    result = unittest.deferredResult(theDeferred)

  "deferredResult" iterates the reactor until the given deferred has a
result, then returns that result.

  See its sibling, deferredError, for testing of failure conditions.

A little comment on unittest and the use of deferredResult. If you use
the optional timeout argument to deferredResult you have to be sure
that theDeferred's callback method has not been called before passing
it to deferredResult or you will get an error about pending calls when
twisted.trial cleans up after your test is run.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] trouble building Quotient
Message-ID: <20031124215927.81933.qmail@web10704.mail.yahoo.com>

trying to build Quotient-0.7.0 with Twisted-4.1.6 on OpenBSD with Berkeley DB (bsddb3-).
made change to atop/store.py to use bsddb3:
from bsddb3.db import *
 
i get this error:
...
    obj = self._loadItemByPath(ctxstore, *path)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages/atop/store.py", line 386, in _loadItemByPath
    raise KeyError(path)
KeyError: (0, 0)

this is the code at that point:
def _loadItemByPath(self, ctxstore, *path):
        """
        Retrieve an item given a sequence of integers.
        """
        stringKey = self._formatIDPath(path)
        print "str=%s"%stringKey;   #debugging...
        stringValue = self.db.get(stringKey, txn=context.get('txn'))
        if stringValue is None:
            raise KeyError(path)
   ...
 
so stringValue is 'None'.
stringKey is shown by the print to be: id00000000000000000000
 
any hints <where to look>/<what to try>?

Hi,

I'd like to setup buildbot on my machine and help Twisted building and
testing packages - as my contribution to Twisted project. I can install it
on a 700 MHz / 256 RAM / NetBSD-stable machine.

Do you accept such submissions? Who should I contact about it?

Take care,

Yes indeed, thank you! Brian Warner should get in touch with you, as
he's on the list.

Message-ID: <007701c3b2db$6f1fe8d0$f00a500a@jsbwxp3>

Hi, I'm answering my own post for the benefit if future newbies:

I was having an awful time installing twisted on a W2K Professional machine.
In desperation, I uninstalled all the Python things (Python 2.3 and
Pythonwin), reinstalled Python 2.3, installed Twisted, and then Pythonwin
and all the installations seemed to go OK. Plus I rebooted in between the
installations because I didn't have a rubber chicken handy to wave over the
computer.

Not much of a technical note, but there it is.

Informal poll: How many of you out there have ever indulged a taste for
totemic decoration and/or fetishistic rituals in connection with debugging?

Hi, I just installed twisted python on my Windows XP laptop which has Python
2.3.2.

I went to install it on Windows 2000 Professional version 5.00.2195 Service
Pack 4 running Python 2.3 and got the following dialog box diagnostic:
"Setup: CreateFile failed; code 5. Access is denied." I've been able to
install piles of stuff on this system before, so I figure I have the
required administrative privileges. I logon to a Windows domain, and my ID
is in the Administrators group of the domain. There is a separate
Administrator logon local to the machine which I haven't used, and probably
can't get the password for, since this is a managed PC within the domain.

Here are my questions:

1) What does the "code 5" failure mean?

2) What am I doing wrong?

3) Can I just move the twisted site-package folders over from my XP system
Python 2.3 folder to the corresponding Windows 2000 Pro folder? I'm mostly
interested in just importing the twisted modules and prototyping; I can do
without the icons and start menu entries.

On my W2K laptop Twisted works without installation problems, since 1.0.7,
then upgraded many times.

You just described "in case of problems, format & reinstall" procedure,
that's known to fix 99.99% problems with Windows machines :)

Make sure mktap is running with same version as python as quotient was
installed with (both should be the same python, and version 2.3).

Message-ID: <6.0.0.22.0.20031125155558.01e4d8d0@anusf.anu.edu.au>

Hi all,

Before I move onto learning about cred, guard and more
sophisticated authentication schemes, I'm trying to get a
simple example working with basic HTTP authentication.

I have a resource subclass who's render() method checks the
values of request.getUsername() and request.getPassword():


class request_create(twisted.web.resource.Resource):
     isLeaf = 1
     addSlash = 0

     def render(self, request):
         if (not request.getUser()) or (not request.getPassword()):
             request.setResponseCode(401, 'Authentication required')
             return twisted.web.error.ForbiddenResource().render(request)

         # do work and render HTML ...

The problem is that no matter what I try getUser() and getPassword()
both return the string "" and the web browser never prompts for a
username/password.

Is the above enough for the simplest possible HTTP authentication
approach in Twisted web or should I be setting HTTP headers before the
request.getUser()/request.getPassword() is performed?

Any advice much appreciated,





Cheers,

Stu

I've looked at the log module documentation of twisted.python and more or
less guess that you can redirect the print statement to a log, and somehow
observe the stuff that is being logged in case you want to write it
somewhere else too. I was able to redirect the Python print statement to a
disk file, but am at a loss when it comes to properly configuring and
installing an observer. I want to observe the logging stream and throw it
out to a Tkinter text window.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

See http://twistedmatrix.com/users/roundup.twistd/twisted/issue393

But you should also read the appropriate RFC. You need to return an
Unauthorized status code (401) and appropriate header if you got no
credentials in order to request browser to send it on next request.

I have a serious problem with some woven applications where deferreds
and their results returned from wmfactory_ methods are not garbage
collected. They just stack up in gc.garbage. The python documentation
states that the contents of gc.garbage are objects that are part of a
cycle can't be collected because they have a __del__ method.

Any help on this issue would be really appreciated.

Deferreds have a __del__ method, used to log unhandled errors, which has
often proved to be a valuable debugging aid (people often forget to
.addErrback(log.err)).

Unfortunately, this means that Deferreds in reference cycles can't be
automatically garbage collected.  Can you boil this down to a minimal test
case?  This sounds like the probable cause of a memory leak some users have
reported with Twisted Web.

The trick will be to figure out what the reference cycle is, and breaking
it.  It may help to do:
    twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.debug = True
and then inspect the .creator attribute of the Deferreds the end up in
gc.garbage.  You could also try manually poking around with gc.get_referrers
on those Deferreds.

If we can find a good enough test case, we might be able to write a unit
test to trigger it and then check gc.garbage, so that we can include it in
the test suite and stop it from happening again.

I'm very keen to find out what's causing this -- let me know if there's
anything I can help with.

-Andrew.

It seems that it is only when the deferreds are instance variables in
the Page that they end up in gc.garbage. It might be related that an
empty Page class with a __del__ method also end up in gc.garbage.

The deferreds that are leaking are coming from pb (aReferenceable.callRemote).

I think that a minimal test case to show the problem would be: (I'll test this later, I have to go in five minutes time).

Pseudo code:
class Page:
   def initialize(self, ...):
       self._deferred = defer.succeed([1, 2, 3])

   def wmfactory_oneTwoThree(self, request):
       return self._deferred


My guess is that self._deferred will end up in gc.garbage.

I will test this later.

  Presumably at some later point you will have a line like
"self._deferred.callback(value)".  Immediately after this (actually, before
is preferable, how is left as an exercise for the reader), you should
"self._deferred = None".  The cycle will be broken and the garbage will be
collectable.

Hi,

I had a problem using wxPython together with twisted.

C-c and friends won't work, that's it. And reactor.spawnProcess may have
issues. This is a bug in wxPython which may have been fixed in newer
versions (and didn't occur in older versions).

No I just return the deferred to woven (with defer.succeed the
callback is already called).

I think I'll have to override Page.pageRenderComplete and set it to
None there.

Hi Jp. It seems that changing the wmfactory_method to do:

        def wmfactory_oneTwoThree(self, request):
            deferred = defer.Deferred()
            self._deferred.chainDeferred(deferred)
            return deferred

Does the trick.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Possible bug in from twisted.internet.app import Application ?
Message-ID: <1069815840.3fc4182061cb1@webmail.telus.net>

I am running freebsd with python 2.2.2 and twisted 1.10

the same code worked fine on another server which is identical
except it is running twisted 1.07 

anyways

from twisted.internet.app import Application
from pyRtpRelay import TRelayService

print "Relay Going Up"
application = Application('pyRtpRelay')
RelayService=TRelayService(application)
RelayService.Start()

Inside my object TRelayService when I call

application.ListenUDP(XXXXXXXX) it will not listen on the required UDP ports and
returns None.

As a temporary hack I then when
       from twisted.internet import reactor
       reactor.ListenUDP(XXXXXX)

and it worked fine

Thanx John

This is for a reason, too complicated to get into (in 1.0.7 it would
sometimes return None as well, in some cases). You should upgrade your
code to use twisted.application instead of twisted.internet.app, which
is deprecated.

Also, sounds like you want to be doing reactor.listenUDP.

Is it possible (or even useful) to have a protocol which expects the
factory which builds it to have a specific interface? (as the protocol
has a .factory attribute and therefore can access methods and attributes
on it's factory)

or must all twisted.protocols be able to work with
internet.protocol.Factory() off-the-shelf?

Nope, it's perfectly fine to have a factory tightly bound to the
protocol. The reason that they're separate objects isn't for
separation of knowledge, but for having a 1-N relationship (N protocol
instances (i.e., connections) per factory).

i was going through the docs, and i found the two classes in
twisted/python/plugin.py, and i was wondering what the difference is
between the two.

i'd like to be able to make a sort of plugin that when the plugin package
is in the path, it interacts in arbitrary ways with my main application.
however, i don't think i'd want it to appear in mktap, as that doesn't
really make sense in this situation.....or does it?

  a DropIn is an abstraction for an entire plugins.tml file.

  a PlugIn is a single entity, typically corresponding to a register() call
in a plugins.tml file.

  mktap only shows plugins of type "tap" (because that is the only kind of
plugin it knows how to use!), so if you make your plugins of a different
type, they won't show up there.

You can have different types of plugins. For example, mktap uses one
kind of plugin, but twisted.lore uses another. IIRC there's a type
keyword arg that indicates what kind of plugin it is.

I've figured out that part. I created a plugin directory, and i set the
type to "myPluginType"...now how do i access my plugin from within the
app?

i've got this in my plugins.tml file:

register ("My plugin package",
		"core.plugin",
		description = """
		Provides functionality to my app.
		""",
		type ="myPluginType")

i did the following in the interpreter:

>>> from twisted.python import plugin
>>> plugin.getPlugIns("myPluginType")
[<Plugin 'My plugin package' core.plugin>]

so i guess my question is, what to i do with this plugin object? i see it
has a property named "module", which is the string i gave it of
"core.plugin". this file doesn't exist yet since i don't know what to put
in it.

i guess i just need a little more guidance. i'm looking through the code
too, but i'm not sure what calls what...

thanks for any help,

-phil

  Call .load() on it, and do something with the result.

  432 is erroneous nickname.  Likely, the server doesn't like the "!" in
your nick.

I am not sure if this was just the most creative unsolicited mail I 
ever received, or if it's a complaint from an unsuspecting user.  I 
think the "werewolf" comment is from the "AUSPEX" capability of the 
POP3 server.

Have crackers been using Twisted for some nefarious scheme?

Message-ID: <003401c3b5a4$8e2aa7d0$4501a8c0@wteixeiradsk1>

	Hi,

	I'm new to the list and I'm just starting with Twisted and Woven.
	I think the framework is great, but I'm having some problems.
	When I try to make two nested <div>, both with independent queries,
	I get na error, the solution I've found is to create another model
	called "loaddata", which does nothing, except call the queries.
	If anyone knows a better way, I'd like to hear, I've searched all
	over the Internet, and found nothing that could help.

	Thanks in advance,

Robert,

your questions have nothing to do with Twisted, those are IRC problems. It's
closing link, because - propably - mydnsname.com is not allowed to connect
to that IRC server. I'd suggest e-mailing some local irc-oriented newsgroup
or list. Thank you.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] PyProtocols 0.9.1 Released
Message-ID: <5.1.0.14.0.20031128160119.028e9dc0@mail.telecommunity.com>

What is PyProtocols?
--------------------

PyProtocols is an extended implementation of PEP 246, adding a new 
"declaration  API" that lets you easily define your own interfaces and 
adapters, and declare what adapters should be used to adapt what types, 
objects, or interfaces.  Using PyProtocols, you can easily make flexible 
frameworks that you or other developers can extend without needing to 
modify the base framework.  PyProtocols interfaces can interoperate with 
those of Twisted and Zope, or can be used entirely standalone.

PyProtocols may be used, modified, and distributed under the same terms
and conditions as Python or Zope.


What's new in version 0.9.1?
----------------------------

* Implemented Samuele Pedroni's "subproto" idea (see 
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2003-June/036242.html) as the 
new 'protocolForType()' API.

* Added other APIs to automatically generate protocols, such as 
'protocolForURI()', 'sequenceOf()', and 'Variation()'.

* Compatible with Zope X3 Milestone 4, Python 2.3.2, and Twisted 
1.1.0.  (Also runs on Python 2.2.2+, if you don't need Zope 3 compatibility.)

* New 'Adapter' and 'StickyAdapter' convenience base classes

* Fixes for compatibility with 'ExtensionClass', and for a memory leak in 
the optional C "speedups" module


PyProtocols Resources
---------------------

* Detailed Changes since the 0.9 release:

* Release notes, installation instructions, and browsable API docs:

Hi,

This is an initial inquiry to find out if anyone really familiar with 
Twisted would want to join me in the development of
a Spammer honeypot system to release into the public domain.

A recent "securityfocus" article seems to indicate some project like 
this might be worthwhile,  and Twisted seems
to be the perfect tool for this....

Not only would it be used to "fool" spammers,  but it also could be 
used to "detect" proxy connections from IRC
bots,  and return the proper "fingerprints" to convince the spammers 
this is a really legit proxy.

I've done a lot of research in this project,  and come to the 
realization that the ONLY way to catch these people
who write such viruses,  is to "suck them into" a honeypot.

Anyone interested,  please Email me at 'crunch at shopip dot com'

Don't reply to my 'lists' mailbox,  as this is only for my mailing 
lists.

Regards
John

Well, I'm no expert on twisted-web, but I wanted to answer your question
in at least a general sense. It is indeed possible to perform such a
task, as twisted.web's object lookup is completely customizable. Drop in
on #twisted on irc.freenode.net and ask someone in there, or if no one
else responds to this thread, email me and I'll help you find out how to
do what you're interested in doing.

  Probably.  It is unclear why this has been done.

I see what's wrong here.

This is part of finger22.py

    def getContext(self):
        """Create an SSL context.

        This is a sample implementation that loads a certificate from a 
file
        called 'server.pem'."""                               
        ctx = SSL.Context(SSL.SSLv23_METHOD)
        ctx.use_certificate_file('server.pem')
        ctx.use_privatekey_file('server.pem')
        return ctx

I should have substituted the certificate_file to the certificate file..

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Re: python-list query re sockets, select or: twisted and other file-descriptors & twisted question
Message-ID: <061d01c3b6fa$2d0a12e0$210110ac@jsbwxp3>

In response to the question about doing serial i/o and using a select
statement, I'd like to quote from
http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-select.html

select(iwtd, owtd, ewtd[, timeout])

This is a straightforward interface to the Unix select() system call. The
first three arguments are lists of `waitable objects': either integers
representing file descriptors or objects with a parameterless method named
fileno() returning such an integer. The three lists of waitable objects are
for input, output and `exceptional conditions', respectively. Empty lists
are allowed, but acceptance of three empty lists is platform-dependent. (It
is known to work on Unix but not on Windows.) The optional timeout argument
specifies a time-out as a floating point number in seconds. When the timeout
argument is omitted the function blocks until at least one file descriptor
is ready. A time-out value of zero specifies a poll and never blocks.
The return value is a triple of lists of objects that are ready: subsets of
the first three arguments. When the time-out is reached without a file
descriptor becoming ready, three empty lists are returned.
Among the acceptable object types in the lists are Python file objects (e.g.
sys.stdin, or objects returned by open() or os.popen()), socket objects
returned by socket.socket().  You may also define a wrapper class yourself,
as long as it has an appropriate fileno() method (that really returns a file
descriptor, not just a random integer). Note: File objects on Windows are
not acceptable, but sockets are.  On Windows, the underlying select()
function is provided by the WinSock library, and does not handle file
desciptors that don't originate from WinSock.

(end quote)

So, select might not yet work on Windows serial ports as well as sockets.
This is also a subject of interest to me, but all I can think of is handling
the sockets via select() and polling periodically for data on the serial
port using callLater() and some win32 calls. Maybe the win32 serial port
handling could even be wrapped in a 'waitable object' as described above for
use with the Python select() call.

I recall reading somewhere that the twisted framework has the ability to
handle serial communications in connection with Global Positioning System
device interaction, but don't have any information about it. I'm going to
post this to the twisted mailing list :

Question for twisted folks: How can I add serial Windows serial port
communications as a twisted protocol? Please cross-post back to the
python-list.

You may want to look at how TouRSSt uses plugins.

Your problem is most likely Deferred models of which you need a 
submodel. Woven is buggy.

Try <ul model="./b" view="List">, that should work.

That's correct.  Windows select is from the Winsock library, and only works
with sockets.

Thankfully, pySerial has already taken care of the details of cross-platform
serial-port access (apparently, I've never used it):

Twisted uses pySerial, so the platform you're running Twisted on shouldn't
matter.  There are some examples in the doc/examples directory of Twisted
that use the serial port:

    mouse.py -- example using MouseMan protocol with the SerialPort
                transport
    gpsfix.py -- example using the SerialPort transport and the NMEA 0183
                 and Rockwell Zodiac GPS protocols to display fix data as it
                 is received from the device.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] getProcessOutpout
Message-ID: <200311301917.36596.lafou@wanadoo.fr>

I have a pb with twisted.internet.utils.getProcessOutput (i never get the 
output :() here is an exemple :

class PGAT_deftest(GAT_page):

    template="""<html><body><span view="Viewtest"></span></body></html>"""

    def wvfactory_Viewtest(self, request, node, model):
        return MyDeferredWidget(model)

    def render(self, request):
        request.write('<html><body><h1>DEFTEST</h1>'+ time.asctime()+'<br >')
        print "Emerge !"
        d = getProcessOutput("ps")
        d.setTimeout(5,self.renderProcessOutput, request)
        d.addCallback(self.renderProcessOutput, request)
        d.addErrback(self.renderError, request)
        d.addCallback(self.finishPage, request)
        return NOT_DONE_YET

    def renderProcessOutput(self, output, request):
        request.write(output)

    def renderError(self, failure, request):
        request.write('it broke! (error : "'+failure.getErrorMessage()+'")')

    def finishPage(self, _, request):
        request.write('</body></html>')
        request.finish()

def montest():
    time.sleep(5)
    return "Ca marche !"

If I create a bash script with :
---
sleep(5)
echo "Hello world"
---
the twisted code above works great. But If I use a system program like "ps" or 
"emerge" , the callback is never called :(

(btw : getProcessOutput ("date") works)
