</I>
No.  It's not a fd leak because loseConnection closes the file 
descriptors.  It just doesn't tell the reactor it has done so.  It 
should leak SSW instances (memory) now, though.

&gt;<i> Anyways, I've changed cfreactor to do what I think should be the right

</I>&gt;<i> failing a lot of tests too, so I don't know if this is a regression or

</I>
I don't really have the time or need to debug this anytime soon.  When 
I first wrote CFReactor, it passed all of the tests.  Either changes in 
PyObjC (unlikely) or Twisted (likely) caused these test failures.  Some 
of it is probably due to tests making incorrect assumptions, especially 
because CFReactor isn't designed to be iterated (it has to set up a 
timer to stop itself).
