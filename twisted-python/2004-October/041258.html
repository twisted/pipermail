</I>
That sound useful. Does the python adodb implementation allow you to
use datetime objects transparently?


&gt;<i> &gt;By rewrite, do you mean that the new version only uses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;ADOdb, or have you added ADOdb as a supported back-end?
</I>&gt;<i> ADOdb adds a level of abstraction on top of db-api. I wrote a version of
</I>&gt;<i> ConnectionPool that uses adodb connections instead of the regular dbapi
</I>&gt;<i> connections and cursors. If this is something python developers find

</I>&gt;<i> switching from) where no common db-api exists, but I still think it's
</I>&gt;<i> quite a nice thing.
</I>
So this would implement a super-set of the adbapi interface, then?
I think this would probably be a useful addition.


&gt;<i> &gt;sqlreflector and row could definitely use a reworking.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I don't think they are used much. I think people mainly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;use adbapi and write their own object mapping system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;What sort of things did you have in mind?
</I>&gt;<i> Well mainly validating the data assigned to a rowobject so one can be

</I>&gt;<i> But if row and sqlreflector isn't used I'll probably build something new
</I>&gt;<i> instead of going through that code. I'm thinking of using the db_row
</I>&gt;<i> module (<A HREF="http://opensource.theopalgroup.com">http://opensource.theopalgroup.com</A>) which seems to offer
</I>&gt;<i> efficient row data access.
</I>
db_row has already been mentioned on this list as a nice module.
But wouldn't the associative array aspects of adodb eliminate the need
for db_row?
