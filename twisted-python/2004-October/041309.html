I had almost finished composing an identical email when this one
arrived.  So, I'll play devil's advocate:

I think that part of the question Ed is asking is, &quot;when can we have
some of Twisted in the stdlib rather than asyncore&quot;.  Considering how
ancient and creaky asyncore is looking right now, I think it might be
valid to consider some small subset of Twisted that subsumes asyncore's
functionality for inclusion in the standard library.

Of course this should be post-split.  I don't think it makes much sense
to try to do something like this now.

Were this to happen, I would suggest it be in a different module name,
&quot;twistedcore&quot; or something, to allow a stable interface to remain in the
standard library, which would have a hope of being easily
plug-compatible with future Twisted versions, but would not hamstring
the ability of the Twisted team to put out new versions.

This might also assuage Guido's concerns about framework-structured
code; we could elide utilities such as twistd, and instead provide
convenience functions for users to write their own daemonization, et.
al.  This would at least provide a minimal platform for running
Twisted-compatible event handlers, to even out the curve between
&quot;install Twisted as a dependency&quot; and &quot;just run this stand-alone
script&quot;.
