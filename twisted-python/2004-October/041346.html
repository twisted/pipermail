</I>Heh, well, to be perfectly honest, the only connection between these two 
things was that it
was through debugging one that I discovered the other.  Basically, the 
reactor installation code
was flawed because the reactor installation code was somehow factored 
out, while the option
was left in, so no matter what you specified with --reactor, you got the 
select reactor.

The reason the select reactor was getting installed was that the 
trial.util class was a top-level
import, and it had twisted.internet.reactor as a top-level import.

This is all fixed and tested for now.
