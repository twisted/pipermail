</I>
It is basically as you describe but with some additions.  The primary
aim is to marshal data from an XML-RPC client to a server using a
custom protocol while providing status information as well as control.

      XML-RPC       Custom
data   ----&gt;  proxy ---&gt; data
source &lt;----  proxy      sink
               ^  |
              /|\ |
               |  |  XML-RPC
               | \|/
               |  V
               GUI
          Monitor/Control
                 

The data source listens (is a server) for data requests which include
a callback URL.  After that, it sends data to (is a client for) the
proxy which forwards the data to the data sink and sends a
confirmation to the GUI monitor.  The proxy also sends heartbeats
fired via reactor.callLater to the GUI.

&gt;<i> Were you running requests in threads before you came up with the
</I>&gt;<i> CommandQueue abstraction?  If not, what caused the deadlocks?  How was
</I>&gt;<i> the client/server blurring related to the deadlocks?
</I>
Yes.  In the proxy, I handle the XML-RPC requests from the data source
and the GUI via this class:

class Spawner(threading.Thread):
    '''Call callable in its own thread, return value is sent into the
    Spawner.deferred.callback()'''

    def __init__(self,callable,errable=None,**kwds):
        threading.Thread.__init__(self,**kwds);
        self.callable = callable
        if errable is None:
            errable = self.chirp
        self.deferred = defer.Deferred()
        self.deferred.addErrback(errable)
        self.setDaemon(1)
        self.start()
        return

    def chirp(self,*args):
	print str(args)
        log.error(str(args))
        return args

    def run(self):
        self.deferred.callback(self.callable())

This runs the request in a thread an returns the value via a deferred
(which is used as the return value for the XML-RPC method).

&gt;<i> Finally, did you consider an approach where, rather than queueing
</I>&gt;<i> commands, you just executed them synchronously and let the reactor
</I>&gt;<i> serialize them?  If so, what lead to the decision to change to a
</I>&gt;<i> thread-based approach?
</I>
The basic data proxying must not be interupted.  Some of the control
requests sent from the GUI can take more than the period between data
updates and thus block that proxying.


It's possible I'm doing something stupid in this design.  Please let
me know if you have improvements.

Thanks,
-Brett.
