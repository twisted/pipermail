If you're using a threadpool of size one, why use a thread pool at all?
Just start a thread.  You don't need (or want) any of the fancy worker
thread management that a thread pool is designed for.

There's nothing in Twisted that requires all your threads run in a Twisted
threadpool; they're just provided for convenience (mainly the convenience of
deferToThread).  If all you need is a single thread, then
    t = threading.Thread(target=foo)
works great.  reactor.callFromThread works from any thread.

In a similar vein, there are times when I've found it simpler to start a
thread for database interactions, rather than use adbapi.  The reason is
much the same: the &quot;pool of workers&quot; model didn't fit what I was trying to
do.
