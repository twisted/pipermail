Er, I don't believe you. If that was the case, it would be a huge fd 
leak, which I'm pretty sure Twisted doesn't have. I removed that hack 
and I don't think anything further broke.

Anyways, I've changed cfreactor to do what I think should be the right 
thing, but it's randomly failing tests. Before my changes it was 
failing a lot of tests too, so I don't know if this is a regression or 
not.
