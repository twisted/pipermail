Those are only kept in a weakref dict, and in the readers/writers 
dicts. removeReader/removeWriter look to me like they are being called, 
so I think it should go away. I dunno if that's a change since 
cfreactor was written or if I'm just wrong or what.

Me neither. If no one is actually interested, I guess it should just be 
marked as probably broken and left at that. I'm going to give up on it.

&gt;<i> When I first wrote CFReactor, it passed all of the tests.  Either 
</I>&gt;<i> changes in PyObjC (unlikely) or Twisted (likely) caused these test 
</I>&gt;<i> failures.  Some of it is probably due to tests making incorrect 
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions, especially because CFReactor isn't designed to be 
</I>&gt;<i> iterated (it has to set up a timer to stop itself).
</I>
I can't even get the tests to run to completion, they hang on 
twisted.mail.test.test_smtp.LoopbackESMTPTestCase.testMessages. Since 
this reactor isn't being run on the buildbot for some reason, it's hard 
to know how long it's been failing.

I also tried checking out revisions 9056 from 2003-10-20 and 9286 from 
2003-11-11. Those are failing about a bazillion tests, mostly with 
pendingTimedCalls still pending: &lt;DelayedCall 35813496 
[-0.0020911693573s] called=0 cancelled=0 
CFReactor._continueSystemEvent('startup',)&gt; warnings. I dunno what's up 
with that.
