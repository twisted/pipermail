</I>&gt;<i> I think that part of the question Ed is asking is, &quot;when can we have

</I>&gt;<i>

  Definitely.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Were this to happen, I would suggest it be in a different module name,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;twistedcore&quot; or something, to allow a stable interface to remain in the
</I>&gt;<i> standard library, which would have a hope of being easily
</I>&gt;<i> plug-compatible with future Twisted versions, but would not hamstring
</I>&gt;<i> the ability of the Twisted team to put out new versions.
</I>
  Obviously the package should be named &quot;internet&quot; :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This might also assuage Guido's concerns about framework-structured
</I>&gt;<i> code; we could elide utilities such as twistd, and instead provide
</I>&gt;<i> convenience functions for users to write their own daemonization, et.
</I>&gt;<i> al.  This would at least provide a minimal platform for running
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted-compatible event handlers, to even out the curve between
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;install Twisted as a dependency&quot; and &quot;just run this stand-alone
</I>&gt;<i> script&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
  So what would actually need to be fixed for this to happen?

    1) Readable abstract reactor implementation

    2) Producer/Consumer API repair

    3) Non-recursive Deferred implementation (or &quot;internet&quot; could be Deferred-less, but that would seem to suck)

    4) Less terrifying Failure implementation (or, again, Failure-less in the stdlib)

    5) Better test coverage (for example, more than one unit test for
       writeSequence)

    6) Latexified documentation (probably automatable)

    7) Something with Interfaces

  Anything else?
