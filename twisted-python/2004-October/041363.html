<PRE>Hello,

thanks for the hint.

Could you elaborate a bit on that?  I have the situation that I have
to wrap two C-libs which are essentially wrappers around proprietary
protocols.  They use blocking networked calls so that I'll want to use
threads to make them play nicely with my twisted app.

Now what I'd like to have is two distinct thread(s/ pools) for them.
One of them would have a threadpool size of 1 (one) because the C-lib
isn't threadsafe and I want implicit serialization without being
forced to synchronize explicitly.  My plan was to use a single thread
(no pool) which blocks on a queue 'till it gets request from the
reactor thread.  When it has accomplished its duties it will use
callFromThread to get the results back to the reactor threads.  Could
you tell me where the pitfalls are you mentioned above in this
scenario?


TIA,

aa
