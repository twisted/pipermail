That's a fair point, and I would like, as best as it can, to be as close 
as possible as a &quot;typical&quot; application; the goal really would be to 
measure the network conditions the applications are facing.

Although I understand I won't be able to get the retries number if the 
underlying code is using getaddrinfo() or something like this, I was 
thinking that twisted.names was maybe offering a &quot;hand-made&quot; resolver, 
which was producing the UDP packets itself and offered a way to plug 
some code there to measure these retries; I haven't checked yet.

But in any case, I guess it's going a little bit against my previous 
point which was to try to measure things &quot;as used by a 'typical' 
application&quot; (which isn't going to use twisted.names custom resolver.)

(Actually, I was surprised to discover that, although it can be 
configured from the command-line, `dig` doesn't report the number of 
tries/retries it makes, you can only deduce it by looking at the overall 
command execution time.)

I will have a look at these options, as I will be running my tests under 
Linux anyway.
It's probably out of scope of Twisted anyway, but I could also retrieve 
the packets sent on the wire by listening on the related network 
interface set in promiscuous mode and correlate packets together. It's 
... &quot;slightly&quot; more work though...

</I>&gt;<i> To do this kind of thing &quot;reliably&quot;, you'd need to reimplement TCP in

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But the info above may be a helpful start.
</I>
Thanks for your answer Phil, I'll see what I can come up with!
