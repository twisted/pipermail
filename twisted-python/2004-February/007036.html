Ilya (creator of PySNMP) just released a new version of PySNMP 
yesterday.  It's noticeably faster feeling than the 3.3.x version.  I 
don't have time to do timings with it, but I'd guess it's probably 
taking 3/4 of the time of the previous version.  Still likely not 0.02 
seconds on getbulk requests, but noticeably faster.

Profiling the ASN parser and writing a small accelerator module would 
likely be quite doable.  From what I've seen there's not a lot of 
complex code in there.  It's just hidden deep in the package structure.  
Nice thing about that approach is that it's possible to port to new 
platforms and only worry about the C module being present if you need 
the speed there.

My primary interest here isn't really in speed, we query 8000 agents at 
a time, and only need to query once every few *hours*.  The flexibility 
&amp; robustness of the code is my primary interest.  Too much C gets me 
worried :) , particularly with networking code, where buffer overflows 
and the like are a pain to avoid.

Have fun,
Mike
