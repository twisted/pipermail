Switching Nevow to PyProtocols would have been my first choice. Since I 
didn't have the time to learn it, and didn't feel like introducing the 
additional dependency at the time, I hacked t.p.c into nevow.compy so 
that I could prevent t.p.c's &quot;import the world&quot; behavior which was 
detrimental to nevow. Unfortunately this means you have to now use 
*two* &quot;global&quot; component registries when you use Nevow.

I am +1000 with using PyProtocols for Nevow since it would reduce my 
headaches. I think that a global component registry is the one central 
important feature of a components system, making the current situation 
less than ideal. twisted.python.components wasn't flexible enough to do 
what I needed to do in Nevow but PyProtocols is, and supports more 
useful things like protocolForURI which will be necessary once people 
start designing interfaces that are useful outside of just one project.

I am less excited about introducing a dependency into Nevow. It would 
be nice if we could distribute PyProtocols in the same tarball as Nevow 
and only install it if needed.
