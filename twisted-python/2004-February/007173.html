Here's an example:

from protocols import *
import peak.utils.imports as imports
# does not depend on other PEAK stuff.. can easily be stolen

mxDateTime = imports.lazyModule('mx.DateTime')
datetime = imports.lazyModule('datetime')
def _hook_mx_DateTime(mxDateTime):
     declareAdapter(
         NO_ADAPTER_NEEDED,
         provides=[IBasicDate],
         forTypes=[mxDateTime.DateTimeType],
     )
     #datetime = imports.lazyModule('datetime')
     def convertToDateTime(obj, protocol):
         msec, second = math.modf(obj.second)
         # handle tzinfo ?
         return datetime.datetime(
             obj.year, obj.month, obj.day,
             obj.hour, obj.minute, int(obj.second),
             int(msec * 1e6), None
         )
     declareAdapter(
         convertToDateTime,
         provides=[IBasicDateTime],
         forTypes=[mxDateTime.DateTimeType],
     )
imports.whenImported('mx.DateTime.mxDateTime.mxDateTime', 
_hook_mx_DateTime)

def _hook_datetime(datetime):
     declareAdapter(
         NO_ADAPTER_NEEDED,
         provides=[IBasicDate],
         forTypes=[datetime.date],
     )
     declareAdapter(
         NO_ADAPTER_NEEDED,
         provides=[IBasicDateTime],
         forTypes=[datetime.datetime],
     )
imports.whenImported('datetime', _hook_datetime)

This could of course be automated a bit more, and there is probably 
even a better way.. but this was the first thing I stumbled across 
without thoroughly reading documentation or asking anyone :)

&gt;&gt;<i> The other alternative is to add a bunch of specific hacks to

</I>&gt;<i> and we can get to this point once we have worked those out.[1]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [1] I need to figure out a succinct way to say this. Maybe some Latin 
</I>&gt;<i> crap. It's way too verbose. spiv suggested &quot;ad nauseum&quot; when I asked 
</I>&gt;<i> him... Better look that one up. ;-)
</I>
PyProtocols really is flexible enough to accommodate whatever.

&gt;&gt;<i> Then we have the issue of the PyProtocols dependency; dependency
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> management can be quite hairy on windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, yeah, I assumed we would include our own (hopefully unhacked) 
</I>&gt;<i> copy of PyProtocols in releases.
</I>
I would suggest including it beside, not inside, Twisted.  The setup.py 
could check to see if a newer version is already installed, too.

&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe I'm alone in these concerns, though.  Does anyone else feel that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> depending on PyProtocols would increase the learning curve for Twisted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even more?  Or is this common knowledge in the Python community that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be leveraged to actually make the curve shallower?  I can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certainly learn to wrap my head around the whole thing if nobody else
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has trouble with it :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I kinda hold this reservation. PyProtocols is VERY complex compared to 
</I>&gt;<i> the t.p.c components system. But maintaining our own inadequate 
</I>&gt;<i> version is pretty sucky.
</I>
Well my first and last significant experience with a t.p.components 
based project:
== start using t.p.c ==
- Why AREN'T adapters transitive?
- How do I expose an interface that the *class* provides?
- Oh, I *can't do that*, I guess I'll have to patch t.p.c.
- Grudgingly write software on top of patched t.p.c.
== t.p.c gone forever ==
- Rewrite the code on PyProtocols.  It's a lot shorter and cleaner, 
even though I do use adapt(..., IFoo) instead of IFoo(...).
- Still haven't found a use case that PyProtocols can't already do.
- Started looking at PEAK, it solves most of the other problems I have 
(lazy imports, bindings, data modeling, etc.)
- .. hoping Twisted starts assimilating PEAK stuff, because it's better 
:<i>)
</I>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There might be some other issues that could come up, but I'm 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> definitely willing to try to &quot;adapt&quot; to Twisted's needs in these 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> areas, especially if it means I could get rid of PyProtocols' 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wrapper code and wrapping tests for Twisted's existing interface 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> class.  :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is clearly something that we need to talk about more.  As many

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PyCon! PyCon! Everybody come to PyCon!

I'm there!
