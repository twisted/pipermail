</I>
Considering that this is a rather uncommon use-case, can it be made into
the non-default Interface class?  Or an attribute/feature of the default
one, such as

	class MyAbstractSub(IMyAbstract.ABC):
		pass

	class DontUseABC:
		__implements__ = MyAbstractSub.Interface

&gt;<i> Again, this would be easily solved by a Twisted-specific subclass of 
</I>&gt;<i> protocols.InterfaceClass, and I don't see that doing it is necessarily a 
</I>&gt;<i> bad thing for either Twisted or PyProtocols, although it may be that it 
</I>&gt;<i> should be considered simply a transitional, backward-compatibility thing.
</I>
The __call__ hack, for me, is more than just syntactic sugar, or a
&quot;transitional, backward-compatibility thing&quot;.  It's fundamental to my
personal use of the component system.  One-argument callables are used
_everywhere_ in Twisted, thanks mostly to Deferreds, but also because
&quot;thing which takes one argument&quot; is a very convenient interface for
using for a variety of different kinds of processing.  An idiom I find
tremendously convenient (even, perhaps especially, when debugging) is
&quot;return foo.doSomethingDeferred().addCallback(IWhatever)&quot;.  IWhatever is
sometimes a variable, too - and it's quite common to use 'str', 'int',
or 'list' there instead of an interface.

Of course, I like the syntactic sugar quite a bit, too :).  It's
self-documenting.  When I have run tutorials for others on the use of
components, showing them an error on x.what(), and then success on
IWhatever(x).what() is enlightening.  Previously,  our analogue of
&quot;adapt&quot;, &quot;getAdapter&quot;, was difficult to explain.

(BTW: a common idiom for using interfaces is to scope method names.  An
optimization I want to add to Twisted at some point is stateless
interface-method-call syntax which can do this efficiently, something
like: IWhatever.what(x).  I believe you should be able to avoid a bunch
of Python object allocation overhead by doing it that way.  Does
PyProtocols provide any such facility?)

&gt;<i> &gt;   If we're going
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;to maintain a component system as part of Twisted, I would like to at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;least get the benefit of having full control over the component system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;within Twisted.  I don't want to have some people using PyProtocols and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;others using PyProtocols+TwistedHacks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I follow you here.  Private extensions to PyProtocols' base 
</I>&gt;<i> classes is certainly permitted and encouraged, to provide additional 
</I>&gt;<i> features needed by particular frameworks, as long as the core interfaces 
</I>&gt;<i> are respected (e.g. 'IOpenProtocol').  PyProtocols itself offers several 
</I>&gt;<i> specialized protocol implementations, including Protocol, InterfaceClass, 
</I>&gt;<i> Variation, URIProtocol, SequenceProtocol, and so on.
</I>[...]
&gt;<i> Actually, if I understand correctly, these mostly sound like things outside 
</I>&gt;<i> PyProtocols' scope.  peak.binding and peak.config implement some of this 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff by defining various interfaces they want, and using PyProtocols to 
</I>&gt;<i> adapt things to those interfaces.  But that's entirely independent of 
</I>&gt;<i> PyProtocols itself.
</I>
&gt;<i> In other words, PyProtocols isn't tightly coupled to a component 
</I>&gt;<i> architecture, but is instead a convenient base for building component 
</I>&gt;<i> architectures.
</I>
Perhaps we should be discussing Twisted using PEAK, then?  I don't want
to use half a component system and implement the other half myself. 
Maybe you can come up with a counterexample, but it seems to me that the
benefit of a common protocol system would be lost without the use of a
common component model.

&gt;<i> Let's take a specific example: you mentioned locating nearby services by 
</I>&gt;<i> interface.  peak.config does this with two interfaces: IConfigSource and 
</I>&gt;<i> IConfigKey:
</I>
Woah there, sparky!  That looks a lot like the earlier documentation I
was having trouble with.  A brief example, maybe? :)

&gt;<i> &gt;Then we have the issue of the PyProtocols dependency; dependency
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;management can be quite hairy on windows.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed.  I've begun correspondence with Bob off-list about the possibility 
</I>&gt;<i> of me helping to port PIMP/PackMan to other platforms, though.
</I>
Thank goodness.  It needs to be done; Twisted needs to be broken up into
smaller pieces.

&gt;<i> By the way, though, I don't know what you mean by &quot;default adapter&quot;.  Do 
</I>&gt;<i> you mean the adapter for type 'object', perhaps?  I can't imagine why 
</I>&gt;<i> somebody would care about that, though.
</I>
I mean the adapter for type &quot;Thing&quot;, mostly.  The general idea being
that you want to override what happens before someone picks up a
&quot;normal&quot; object when they're under the influence of a particular
enchantment.  It is difficult to specify rules for which enchantment's
hook takes precedence, so authors get into fights by specifying
ever-lower numbers.

&gt;<i> Stop trying to understand it and just use it.  ;)
</I>
Really, an interface specification / lookup system is a pretty basic
part of a system which uses it, on par with a function calling
convention.  I want to know _exactly_ what goes on when I use it; I
never want to be surprised by a weird component getting looked up when
that wasn't what I intended.  With so much indirection in place that's
too easy already.

&gt;<i> So, as you can see right there, writing docs with Jim Fulton in mind as the 
</I>&gt;<i> intended audience is where I made my big mistake.  :)
</I>
Quite.  But, it seems like for that audience, you wrote it well :).  As
much as I respect his work, I don't think it would be a misnomer to call
me bizarro jim fulton.  I tend to have near-opposite interest in
problems, but to come up with identical-looking solutions more often
than not...

&gt;<i> No, 
</I>
Sad to hear that :-(

&gt;<i> but I have an IRC client.  :)
</I>
irc.freenode.net/#twisted is always there (and I am often in it)
