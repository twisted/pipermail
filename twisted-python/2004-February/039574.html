It was &lt;= MSNP7 that were the phased out protocol versions. You can access the MSN
network using MSNP8 and onwards (doc/examples/msn_example.py should let you connect).

This isn't to say that support for MSNP9 wouldn't be appreciated :-). I did some research
into it a while back but it was still fairly premature at the time and not much was known.
Considering it mainly consists of eye-candy features (i.e. background images and buddy icons)
I didn't put too much effort into attempting to figure it out, but it would be great if you
wanted to do so, there is probably a bit more information available on it at this stage as
well.

If you're interested, a useful website that attempts to document various parts of the
protocol is: <A HREF="http://www.hypothetic.org/docs/msn/index.php.">http://www.hypothetic.org/docs/msn/index.php.</A>

Of course, there is now MSNC1 and MSNP10, so it would be worth researching them if you're
wanting to make changes.

Cheers,

Sam Jordan
