I'm actually using it a bit more specifically than that; I'm specifically 
targeting applications that have a &quot;shared resource domain&quot; (and whose data 
integrity or availability has fiduciary consequences), or tools needed to 
develop, maintain or support such applications.  IOW, a desktop email 
client (for example) wouldn't count, but a group issue tracker for emailed 
requests would.

By &quot;fiduciary consequences&quot;, I mean that if it's not running when it's 
supposed to be, or data integrity isn't maintained, it results in financial 
losses.  By &quot;shared resource domain&quot;, I effectively mean a multi-user 
application, or shared processing resources like a mail server.  I think 
you'll find that these two concepts (shared resources and fiduciary 
responsibility) are the common themes underlying what most people mean when 
they talk about &quot;enterprise&quot; applications.  Or at least, I think people who 
*buy* enterprise applications would stress these as defining 
characteristics, whether the people who *sell* such applications really 
fulfill them or not.  :)
