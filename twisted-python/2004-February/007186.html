You're right, the developers probably had vastly different applications 
in mind. However, the only technical difference I notice in the 'game 
simulations' arena is Componentized, and that's actually a fairly simple 
thing (In fact, from what I read in the PyProtocols documentation last 
night, it seemed like similar things already exist, or could trivially 
be implemented).

You can talk about 'different philosophies', but that's meaningless 
until you say what technical differencies you actually mean. Maybe you 
could explain what aspects of twisted.python.components you consider are 
more simulation-oriented? I'm sure it's not that hard for you to squeeze 
down your '5 or 6 pages', as I've seen you explain various Reality 
concepts in much less text, and we have an audience that's very familiar 
with component systems, interfaces, and adapters here. Maybe Jp can jump 
in, too, as he was the one who originally brought up the 'difference in 
philosophies' point.

As far as the technical stuff goes, PyProtocols and t.p.c do the same 
thing, and PyProtocols *can* do everything we have and want, at least 
from what I've recently heard people want (string adaptation, 
Componentized, adapter contexts...).

&gt;<i> However, I am not sure, because I can't figure out what PEAK as a whole
</I>&gt;<i> is really for.  The likely source of an explanation,
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://peak.telecommunity.com/Articles/WhatisPEAK.html">http://peak.telecommunity.com/Articles/WhatisPEAK.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> seems awfully vague.  What is the problem that PEAK was designed to
</I>&gt;<i> solve, exactly?  Clearly it was difficult, because there was a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> solution :)
</I>
Yeah, reading PEAK's web site is pretty amusing. otoh, our own web copy, 
while less 'professional', is also pretty lame :-)
