Please forgive the self-linking, but you might like to take a look at
libsnmp: <A HREF="http://seafelt.unicity.com.au/libsnmp.">http://seafelt.unicity.com.au/libsnmp.</A> I wrote it to replace
pySNMP in a product we're working on, for various reasons, speed being
one of them. The main difference between the two is that libsnmp isn't
a generic ASN.1 decoder; we've hardcoded things specific to SNMP to
make things faster. It seems to scale quite well so far.

&quot;You've got that exactly backwards.  Windows was a boot loader that was
 mutilated and tortured by sadistic psychopaths of the highest order in
 order to make it superficially resemble an OS.&quot;
