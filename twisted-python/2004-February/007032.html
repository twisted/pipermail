<PRE>I've written a UDP-based protocol adaptor (TwistedSNMP) where one of the 
key requirements is the ability to scan thousands of SNMP Agents 
&quot;simultaneously&quot; (i.e. the requests should be asynchronously sent and 
retired as the Agents respond).

<A HREF="http://members.rogers.com/mcfletch/programming/index.htm#TwistedSNMP">http://members.rogers.com/mcfletch/programming/index.htm#TwistedSNMP</A>

Writing a simple asynchronous loop myself (poll on a simple socket, send 
message from queue when writable, read one into other queue when 
readable) allowed for doing a few thousand queries simultaneously), with 
only a few dozen dropped messages.  However, with the Twisted equivalent 
(UDPTransport with my simple protocol object), I was seeing huge drop 
rates, so, gathering that Twisted isn't queueing up the UDP requests, I 
wrote a (byzantine) query-throttling mechanism with Twisted defers.

Problem is, it's a byzantine, fragile (and *slow*) solution to what 
would *seem* to be one of the most common requirements in networked 
development.  Worse yet, because I am seeing such high drop rates I wind 
up having to batch in very small groups, serially (instead of 
parallel-ly), so the primary purpose of the system (fast querying of 
thousands of agents) is lost.  (Instead of taking 1 or 2 minutes to 
query 800 or so Agents it will take on the order of 10 minutes.)

So, the question: is there a simple way to turn on buffered mode in UDP 
transports so that they can deal with queueing up a few thousand 
messages to send, sending them, then having a few thousand computers 
send a reply (within a few seconds of one another)?  Is Twisted just not 
Queue-reliant via use of some mechanism I haven't discovered yet?  Even 
if I do find a decent queueing mechanism, I'm still left with the 
problem that timeouts and the like are going to wind up being measured 
from queueing-time, rather than sending time... not an issue if 
everything gets sent in a half-second or so, but a real problem if it 
takes 8 or 9 seconds just to send the original messages out.

Looking at the udp.Port class, I'm not seeing anything providing a 
queue, seems as though there's a non-blocking write or read, but nothing 
to handle overflows of sends or receives AFAICT, though it looks as 
though a protocol could do some queueing on incoming in its 
datagramReceived... just not sure how that would work.

Thoughts appreciated,
Mike
