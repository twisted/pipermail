Please forgive the self-linking, but you might like to take a look at
libsnmp: <A HREF="http://seafelt.unicity.com.au/libsnmp.">http://seafelt.unicity.com.au/libsnmp.</A> I wrote it to replace
pySNMP in a product we're working on, for various reasons, speed being
one of them. The main difference between the two is that libsnmp isn't
a generic ASN.1 decoder; we've hardcoded things specific to SNMP to
make things faster. It seems to scale quite well so far.

 mutilated and tortured by sadistic psychopaths of the highest order in
 order to make it superficially resemble an OS.&quot;
