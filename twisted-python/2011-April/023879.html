I was just thinking about this.

It would be very easy to write a single twisted/plugins/rdf_plugins.py
file that scans for non-python metadata defined plugins and creates
them.

That way twisted doesn't need to depend on an RDF lib, and this can
be a 'third party' outside-of-twisted package that if you want to use,
you just specify it as a dependancy along with the rest of the things
that your project depends on.

... I like this idea for a variety of reasons.
