My understanding was that .py files have to be installed into
twisted/plugins as binary blobs, not as ordinary Python modules, because
of special rules like &quot;twisted/plugins must not be a Python package&quot;. If
distutils/setuptools/etc. can handle a binary blob with a &quot;.py&quot;
extension, I figured it could handle a binary blob with any other
extension.

If that's wrong, then yeah, I guess that would be a problem.

Well, the nice thing about ConfigParser is that it's in the stdlib, and
people already know how to create them, and rolling
yet-another-config-file-format seems crazy in this day and age.

If you need a non-Turing-complete config language and rule out .ini and
XML, I'm not sure what's left. JSON, perhaps.

</I>&gt;<i> that 'twistd' specifically needs, as Twisted plugins are already used
</I>&gt;<i> for more than just twistd plugins, and I'd like them to be used for
</I>&gt;<i> even more.
</I>
I've never actually come across anything that used Twisted plugins
besides twistd, so I'd forgotten they weren't twistd-specific.

&gt;<i> So as not to make this message too long, I'll defer a description my

</I>
I'll look forward to it. :)

Tim.
