Most platforms' socket APIs don't provide a convenient (or necessarily any) way
to see how much data has been ACKed by the peer (which I assume is what you mean
by &#8220;if the write was successful&#8221;).  So Twisted doesn't have any API for
reporting that to you either.

The usual way to observe how much data was sent is to run tcpdump (or wireshark
or simliar).  Similarly to observe how much data is received run tcpdump on the
receiver.  If there's a discrepancy then something between those two points is
losing your data.

Intermittent failures involving large writes may be a PMTU issue on your
network.  Try reducing the MTU value on your router(s) perhaps.
