Actually, twisted is on my list of packages to convert to bento to get a 
feeling of what's missing in bento :) To get an actual idea of what it 
is looking ATM, you can see here: 
<A HREF="https://github.com/cournape/numpy/tree/bento_waf_build">https://github.com/cournape/numpy/tree/bento_waf_build</A> (bento.info and 
bscript - especially numpy/core/bscript).

The reason why the distutils compatibility thing is not emphasized is 
because I cannot possibly support what makes bento interesting in my 
mind under this mode: out of tree builds, hooks support, recursive 
description, pluggable build backend, etc... After all, if I could 
support what I have in mind with distutils, I would have started from 
distutils and not from scratch (I already did in a former life, and 
bento is born out of that failure).

Now, concerning the use of pip/easy_install: if those tools's author 
were willing to add hook to support additional tool, it would not take 
much. Fundamentally, you only need to say &quot;bentomaker install&quot; instead 
of &quot;python setup.py install&quot;, plus all the dirty details. This will be 
needed anyway with the distutils2 effort, since they have also started 
using a static format description and python setup.py install will not 
work anymore (IIRC).

As for what you would gain doing so:
	- robust recursive support (things like relativeTo as used in twisted 
are inherently fragile once you don't want to assume source tree == 
current directory)
	- automatic dependency handling, easy customization and parallel 
support for compiled code (waf automatically scan sources to find header 
dependencies - waf has its quircks, but it has been recently used by 
SAMBA, which is a pretty good endorsement in my mind as far as complex 
builds go)
	- a simple and robust way to install data files (install things in 
chroots will finally be possible, a pet-peeve of mine when deploying 
twisted apps)
	- it would help me evangelizing bento :)

As you mentioned, most people say &quot;sigh, another packaging python 
thing&quot;. I have not found a good angle to quickly describe what I am 
doing, because it is more about the how than the what. Maybe you could 
say that bento is trying the &quot;pylons approach&quot; of reusing existing 
tools, whereas distutils is more of the &quot;django approach&quot;. For the scipy 
community (where I am coming from), the advantages of using a real build 
tool with dependency handling is obvious, but many people don't care 
about that.

Note that bento is currently a moving target, but I hope to be close to 
a first alpha in a couple of months (bento development has started in 
december 2009). I am careful with timing because I don't want to 
reproduce the precedent of setuptools which became popular but with 
issues that became too costly to fix afterwards.

cheers,

David
