<PRE>glyph,

&gt;<i> I really wish we would stop calling things &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot;.
</I>
My wording of exarkun's wording. He gave a much more detailed description
of what he think's is &quot;crazy&quot; about pb.

&gt;<i> make your own decisions about how to write your own code.
</I>
Indeed, but gathering information from wiser folks is always a good idea,
and usually best done _often_ during development :)

&gt;<i> I'm happy to trade 2-for-1 - if you do two code reviews, I will regard it
</I>as an immediate obligation for
&gt;<i> me to review a ticket you direct me to ;).
</I>
Deal. However, rather than direct your attention to tickets, at this stage
I would rather trade reviews for discussion. I'll do two reviews and then
post a few questions to this mailing list thread. Once I start actually
writing patches/new code we can trade reviews for attention to tickets. Ok?

&gt;<i> These would also be easier to land, and a couple of decades in open
</I>source has taught me that nothing
&gt;<i> motivates development activity like successful development activity ;).
</I>
Indeed. There are one or two architectural issues I want to understand
before moving on to real coding. I will try to get through that asap by
reviewing tickets and trading for discussion of those architectural issues.

&gt;<i> Hopefully you can make sense out of the explanations above and your own
</I>existing knowledge.
&gt;<i> Are there any other phases of the process which are confusing?
</I>
This all makes sense now. I hadn't understood the point of the cooker, but
now that you've explained it, I understand what's going on. I will
transform your mailing list explanation to documentation shortly.

Daniel
