<PRE>Dustin,

&gt;<i> Adding what amounts to a use-after-free bug to the protocol seems like a
</I>really bad idea to me.

Oh goody, a sarcastic comment which doesn't actually bother to explain the
bug :)

Since what I describe is basically WeakReferenceable, it's not obvious to
me that there's a bug. I tell you when the thing to which your
Remote(Weak)Reference points is destroyed, just like weak references invoke
finalization callbacks. If you try to invoke remote methods after than
happens I just return you an error. What's the problem? This is exactly how
weak references work.

&gt;<i> If your server-side app is sensitive to when objects are destroyed for
</I>any reason aside
&gt;<i> from management of its memory consumption, I'd argue your app is broken.
</I>
That's a really good point. Only CPython destroys objects deterministically
when the ref count hits zero.

&gt;<i> Certainly it opens you to a denial of service from a malicious client,
</I>which might hold references
&gt;<i> to objects you'd rather it didn't
</I>
So my instinct to keep strong references only where they're needed is just
bad? Should a GUI or a logger keep a strong reference to the things they
observe?

Daniel
