&gt;<i> Now to bring the thread back on-topic,
</I>
Yes, let's get back to it, shall we?

&gt;<i> I'd like to ask what pb should do in principle. In other words, what is the specification for the flavors? I think a discussion of each pb flavor would be helpful and would provide me material from which I can generate missing docstrings [1]. I'd rather do it this way instead of backing out what the standing implementation currently does so that I don't waste time working on something which is a fundamentally bad idea. This discussion should be a small investment at the present time.
</I>
That sounds like a good idea.

&gt;<i> Copyable:
</I>&gt;<i> The functionality provided by Copyable is simple. The sender of the Copyable just sends it and *forgets*. Therefore, sending a Copyable is basically just sending atomic data in a particular format. I don't think we need to discuss this any further.
</I>
Yes.  There's an important corollary to this: a Copyable ought to be immutable.  A Copyable really represents a &quot;value&quot; in the functional programming sense, and not an &quot;object&quot; in the OO sense.

&gt;<i> Referenceable:
</I>&gt;<i> When I send you a Referenceable, I send a GUID so that you can later refer to that object.
</I>
It's not really a GUID.  The &quot;G&quot; in GUID stands for &quot;global&quot;, and the IDs in Referenceable specifically draw a distinction: &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/a8227e5562a4f9074bb0d5faf6a10e91069704aa/twisted/spread/pb.py#L507-L511">https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/a8227e5562a4f9074bb0d5faf6a10e91069704aa/twisted/spread/pb.py#L507-L511</A>&gt;.  They're named LUIDs throughout.

The ID is connection-local.  When the PB connection goes away, so does the reference to that object.

&gt;<i> For example, I send you a message with argument (psuedo code)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;referenceable-'Joe'&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a declaration that I am keeping hold of an object called &quot;Joe&quot; upon which you may call methods remotely. Specifically, you can send me
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;'Joe-foo-4&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> which tells me to call Joe.foo(4) and send you the result.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. How long should the GUID for Joe survive? If Joe is deleted can I reuse the name &quot;Joe&quot; for an object created later?
</I>
Right now these IDs survive until the end of the connection.  We might want to have other ways to address objects, but that should be something higher-level; a naming service that lets you request an object by some identifier.

The ID is a counter, and since it's a Python integer, it'll never even wrap around, so it won't be re-used within the scope of the same connection.

&gt;<i> 2. Do I notify you if Joe disappears on my side?
</I>
Yes. &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/a8227e5562a4f9074bb0d5faf6a10e91069704aa/twisted/spread/pb.py#L365-L369">https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/a8227e5562a4f9074bb0d5faf6a10e91069704aa/twisted/spread/pb.py#L365-L369</A>&gt;.

&gt;<i> Let's stop here for now. I owe glyph some reviews [2].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yours sincerely,
</I>&gt;<i> Daniel
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [1] I already submitted a patch to the pb documentation and improved the submission based on review. I hope this provides some indication of my commitment to make material contributions. I mention this because glyph made a comment suggesting that showing real work would be valuable.
</I>
Thanks for pointing that out.  Stuff is happening, everybody ;-).

&gt;<i> [2] Is this the beginning of a process which will lead me in the end to complete servitude and loss of ownership of my own soul?
</I>
Oh, don't worry.  That's not the end.  That is merely the beginning.
