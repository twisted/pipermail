</I>&gt;<i> That btw is something I’m trying to fight on IRC whenever I can for months now.  @inlineCallbacks may be worse than pure Deferreds in some ways, but they are amazing to get people to give Twisted a chance and start appreciating it (most people still have no clue what Twisted actually can do for them; hence the “who needs Twisted when we have tulip!?” questions).  And FWIW I have a mid-sized Twisted application running on top of @inlineCallbacks for years now and it works just fine.

+1

I stopped trying to use @inlineCallbacks because I was told it was bad (without much explanation why) anytime I posted a code snippet and asked for help with something that was using it. End result was that I didn’t really want to write much Twisted code because I don’t like the style of code where you’re working with pure Deferreds.
