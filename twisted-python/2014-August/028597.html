<PRE>Moved from pb documentation thread.

&gt;&gt;<i> I've participated in this discussion several times:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hypothetical Amalgam of Median Interlocutors Speaking Here: &quot;I'm using
</I>Tulip because
&gt;&gt;<i> I really like its style of coroutines.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Glyph: &quot;That's interesting. Did you know that Twisted has an equivalent
</I>style of coroutines,
&gt;&gt;<i> called inlineCallbacks, that's been around for years?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HAMISH: &quot;I saw that, and I asked about that a while ago and I heard it
</I>was bad.  It haven't
&gt;&gt;<i> heard that Tulip has the same problems, though.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Glyph: &quot;Really? What problems does inlineCallbacks have that Tulip's
</I>coroutines don't?&quot;
&gt;&gt;<i> HAMISH: &quot;When I asked about it everybody told me I have to use Deferreds
</I>instead, but
&gt;&gt;<i> Deferreds are really confusing and they make your code look all gross,
</I>so I didn't want to
&gt;&gt;<i> do that.  With Tulip I don't have to!&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Glyph: &lt;facepalm&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People finally stopped knee-jerking at async/event-based programming and
</I>we&#8217;re keeping
&gt;<i> them out by being perfectionist smart-asses.  Next time someone asks
</I>about them, keep
&gt;<i> your &#8220;ugh inlineCallbacks&#8221; to yourself; a future contributor may come out
</I>of it.

Confirmed. When I first learned about twisted and had no idea what a
&quot;future&quot; was, deferreds made no sense to me [1]. However, when I saw how to
use inlineCallbacks was the first time I went

&quot;Oh, that's neat.&quot;

Daniel

[1] For the interested, the crucial element which eluded me was the fact
that when you get a deferred from a function call, the thing which gave you
the deferred probably promises to _fire that deferred for you later_.
Somehow, that simple idea just didn't make it into my brain for a while.
And while I have your attention, oh connoisseur of twisted pedagogy, I
really think David Peticolas's tutorial should be on the front page.
