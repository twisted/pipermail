<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Of course the problems that we describe with inlineCallbacks are the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exact same problems that you will have with Tulip-style coroutines,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and in fact in one of the conversations that was averaged out to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; produce the above composite, my interlocutor specifically mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that they'd already had the kind of bug that explicit-yield coroutines
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can sometimes encourage (thoughtlessly putting in too many 'yield's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and not considering their consequences) and were wondering how Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dealt with that sort of thing.
</I>

In my understanding Tulip-style coroutines have one advantage. You can use
'yield from ...', which says something like: &quot;don't go through event loop,
but delegate to another coroutine directly&quot;. I think this is faster and can
make implementation of event loop simpler. But I can be wrong. Please,
correct me.

Also, I think discussion of advantages/disadvantages of inlineCallbacks had
started before invention of 'yield from ...'. But I can't say much about
it, because I started using twisted not so long ago. So I am also
interested in this discussion.

So what are the exact same problems that both inineCallbacks and
Tulip-style coroutines have?

Maxim
