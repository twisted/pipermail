</I>&gt;<i> That btw is something I&#8217;m trying to fight on IRC whenever I can for months now.  @inlineCallbacks may be worse than pure Deferreds in some ways, but they are amazing to get people to give Twisted a chance and start appreciating it (most people still have no clue what Twisted actually can do for them; hence the &#8220;who needs Twisted when we have tulip!?&#8221; questions).  And FWIW I have a mid-sized Twisted application running on top of @inlineCallbacks for years now and it works just fine.

+1

I stopped trying to use @inlineCallbacks because I was told it was bad (without much explanation why) anytime I posted a code snippet and asked for help with something that was using it. End result was that I didn&#8217;t really want to write much Twisted code because I don&#8217;t like the style of code where you&#8217;re working with pure Deferreds.
