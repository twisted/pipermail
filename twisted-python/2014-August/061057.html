That btw is something I’m trying to fight on IRC whenever I can for 
months now.  @inlineCallbacks may be worse than pure Deferreds in some 
ways, but they are amazing to get people to give Twisted a chance and 
start appreciating it (most people still have no clue what Twisted 
actually can do for them; hence the “who needs Twisted when we have 
tulip!?” questions).  And FWIW I have a mid-sized Twisted application 
running on top of @inlineCallbacks for years now and it works just fine.

People finally stopped knee-jerking at async/event-based programming and 
we’re keeping them out by being perfectionist smart-asses.  Next time 
someone asks about them, keep your “ugh inlineCallbacks” to 
yourself; a future contributor may come out of it.
