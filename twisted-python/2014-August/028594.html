<PRE>Sorry for hijacking the thread, but I actually was going to ask
something about this a few days ago, so let's use this reference from
Glyph as a starting point instead :)

It's not the first time I'm hearing that there are problems/and or
limitations with inlineCallbacks, and I don't think I ever read
somewhere what they were exactly? And so, each time I'm seeing code
using inlineCallbacks, I'm frowning then realizing I have no idea why I
did...

Is there some place where I could find more information about these
problems/limitations? That would be enlightening.
