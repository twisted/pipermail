<PRE>Twisted dev people dudes,

&gt;<i> Nevertheless, *Daniel* didn't lead with the details and refrain from a
</I>value judgement, so the
&gt;<i> advice applies equally well to him.
</I>
Lesson learned. Thanks. I agree that this is important.

Now to bring the thread back on-topic, I'd like to ask what pb should do *in
principle*. In other words, what is the specification for the flavors? I
think a discussion of each pb flavor would be helpful and would provide me
material from which I can generate missing docstrings [1]. I'd rather do it
this way instead of backing out what the standing implementation currently
does so that I don't waste time working on something which is a
fundamentally bad idea. This discussion should be a small investment at the
present time.

Copyable:
The functionality provided by Copyable is simple. The sender of the
Copyable just sends it and *forgets*. Therefore, sending a Copyable is
basically just sending atomic data in a particular format. I don't think we
need to discuss this any further.

Referenceable:
When I send you a Referenceable, I send a GUID so that you can later refer
to that object. For example, I send you a message with argument (psuedo
code)

&quot;referenceable-'Joe'&quot;

This is a declaration that I am keeping hold of an object called &quot;Joe&quot; upon
which you may call methods remotely. Specifically, you can send me

&quot;'Joe-foo-4&quot;

which tells me to call Joe.foo(4) and send you the result.

1. How long should the GUID for Joe survive? If Joe is deleted can I reuse
the name &quot;Joe&quot; for an object created later?
2. Do I notify you if Joe disappears on my side?

Let's stop here for now. I owe glyph some reviews [2].

Yours sincerely,
Daniel

[1] I already submitted a patch to the pb documentation and improved the
submission based on review. I hope this provides some indication of my
commitment to make material contributions. I mention this because glyph
made a comment suggesting that showing real work would be valuable.

[2] Is this the beginning of a process which will lead me in the end to
complete servitude and loss of ownership of my own soul?
