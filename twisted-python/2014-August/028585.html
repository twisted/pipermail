This was a complaint about a general trend, not about specific words.  Clearly exarkun gave you the impression that it is &quot;bad&quot;, whether he specifically said so or not.

We're all intimately familiar with everything that's terrible about all of our code, and we aren't shy about sharing.  I just would like it if we could really lead with the details and refrain from value judgements :).

&gt;<i> &gt; make your own decisions about how to write your own code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, but gathering information from wiser folks is always a good idea, and usually best done _often_ during development :)
</I>
I might quibble with &quot;wiser&quot; but okay.  I'm happy to provide feedback earlier so I don't have to say &quot;what is this disaster&quot; later ;-).

&gt;<i> &gt; I'm happy to trade 2-for-1 - if you do two code reviews, I will regard it as an immediate obligation for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me to review a ticket you direct me to ;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Deal. However, rather than direct your attention to tickets, at this stage I would rather trade reviews for discussion. I'll do two reviews and then post a few questions to this mailing list thread. Once I start actually writing patches/new code we can trade reviews for attention to tickets. Ok?
</I>
I'm happy to do that.

&gt;<i> &gt; These would also be easier to land, and a couple of decades in open source has taught me that nothing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; motivates development activity like successful development activity ;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed. There are one or two architectural issues I want to understand before moving on to real coding. I will try to get through that asap by reviewing tickets and trading for discussion of those architectural issues.
</I>
I'll try to respond to these questions regardless.  I would like to help.  It's just that the reviews will create a more tangible sense of commitment :).

&gt;<i> &gt; Hopefully you can make sense out of the explanations above and your own existing knowledge.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are there any other phases of the process which are confusing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This all makes sense now. I hadn't understood the point of the cooker, but now that you've explained it, I understand what's going on. I will transform your mailing list explanation to documentation shortly.
</I>
Great, glad that helped.
