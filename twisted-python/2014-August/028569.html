<PRE>glyph,

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Is there a specification for the pb dialect of banana?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beyond the code, no.
</I>
Ok.

&gt;<i> I would be happy to answer questions, but obviously I'm not super
</I>responsive :).
&gt;<i> Let me know what you need.
</I>
For two personal projects, I would like to have a reasonable remote objects
library in python. I need something which can announce state changes to
clients, and receive state change requests from clients. My solution:

1. Make server side class which can spawn Cacheables when it wants to tell
clients of its existence.
2. Give RemoteCaches to clients and use observe_* methods as appropriate.
3. Stuff a Viewable into the RemoteCaches so that clients can request state
changes.

Question #1: Is this a reasonable use of pb?

This all worked great until I ran into a bug. In trying to fix the bug, I
found that

1. pb code is really hard to understand
2. exarkun's thinks pb is bad and that I should implement what I need in
AMP.
3. exarkun thinks banana and jelly are reasonable.

Question #2: Would you recommend implementing a simplified replacement for
pb on top of banana/jelly, or starting over from AMP? I favor the
banana/jelly route because the protocol seems intrinsically flexible, but I
read your blog explaining why protocols like banana are bad, so I'm
confused about what I &quot;should&quot; do.
