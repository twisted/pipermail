I agree, and I'll gladly change that branch, but I didn't think it made sense to change the coding standard for the previous one.

Do you want to update the coding standard to be a bit less vague in this area?

Emacs actually does a better job with the additional newline, because if you ask it to *without* the additional newline, it wraps the first line of the _docstring_ to 80 chars, it ignores indentation.  I've been ignoring that for the moment because it is seldom actually an issue, but it still bothers me.
