I agree with you. One single protocol class which handles all
operations might be the better way. I think my problem is a very
basic one and the examples I saw so far all did the following:

Build the factory client class wich instanciates the protocol. Within
this protcol class all steps to do a single task are more or less
automatic. That means that it is triggered by an eventhandler function and then in a
series of deferreds and callbacks the task is solved. I.e selecting
a Mailbox.
This way it is clear to me how to implement a protocol which does
one single task, but I'm missing a way how to implement more than
one action. I think my problem is that don't know who to start
an action in the protocol class which is not triggered by an
eventhandler like the &quot;serverGreeting&quot; method in the IMAP examples. 

&gt;<i> Mind that the protocol usually will, once instatiated
</I>&gt;<i> from the Factory, stay till the end of that connection, serving
</I>&gt;<i> subsequent requests, 
</I>
Yes that is what I want :) But at the moment I connect and
disconned to the server for each operation which is indeed a bad
way! But as described above it seems that I have some basic
problems in understandinding how to do this :(

best regards
Torsten
