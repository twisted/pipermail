I just read PEP 257.  What features in particular are you referring to?  Most of it seems to be about encoding redundant information.

By section:

&quot;What is a Docstring?&quot;
 - I think we all know
 - &quot;Use triple quotes&quot;, sure.

&quot;One Line Docstrings&quot;  Hopefully we should have only a few of these, it seems odd to dedicate so much verbiage to them.

&quot;Multi-Line Docstrings&quot;
 - One-line summary: not always possible.  Following another aspect of our coding standard, a &quot;line&quot;, in a method-level docstring, is at most 72 characters, you've burned a minimum of 8 in indentation, and that's often not enough space to summarize.  One sentence summary?  Sure.
 - Blank line before and after class docstrings?  I don't see this followed anywhere.  Especially not *before* docstrings: the convention is:
    class X:
        &quot;&quot;&quot; ...
pretty much everywhere.  I don't see any reason to change it.
 - &quot;docstring of a script...&quot; not applicable because of t.p.u.O
 - &quot;list the classes...&quot; not applicable because of pydoctor
 - &quot;docstring for a function...&quot; ... yes, it should describe arguments, side effects, return values; what else would it do?
 - &quot;docstring for a class...&quot; not applicable again because of pydoctor; this information is redundant
 - &quot;if a class subclasses another class...&quot; not applicable again because of pydoctor's inheritance listing
 - &quot;DO NOT use the Emacs convention...&quot; uh yeah, also don't spell all your method names wrong or use synonyms for them

&quot;handling docstring indentation&quot; 
 - this whole section is about docstring processing tools, which, unless I manage to convince mwh to embed pydoctor in lore for some reason, Twisted is not :).
