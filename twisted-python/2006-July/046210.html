Blech.  Does this style of docstring formatting make anyone else barf?
I notice that jml pointed out on the review of #1940 that the coding
standard nominally requires this.  Two points:

  * I think the coding standard is unclear in what it is trying to
communicate.  It gives an example of a docstring with no leading newline
and from this one might infer that all docstrings should omit leading
newlines, when really it is suggesting that simple, single-line lead-ins
to docstrings belong on the same line as the opening triple quotes.

  * I don't think what the coding standard says is actually relevant
anymore.  This was a display hack to appease a very old version of epydoc.
pydoctor and even the current version of epydoc don't care about this
whitespace.

I think the style prevalent throughout the unit tests is ideal:

    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Blah.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;

This is the easiest to read.  It is unfortunate the emacs has such a hard
time with this construct, but I think it is what we should adopt anyway.
