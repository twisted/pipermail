The Deferred tells you two things.  It tells you when an operation has
completed and it tells you the result of the operation.  It tells you
*when* by calling your callback function at that time.  It tells you
what *result* by the value it passes to that callback function.

So if you want to connect, then do the &quot;start&quot; operation many times, then
stop, then disconnect, you have some Deferreds and a simple recursion-
or loop-like structure.  For example,

    # First, set up the connection.
    taskDeferred = connect(...)
    def cbConnected(connectResult):
        # This function will run once the Deferred returned by `connect´
        # fires.  Here, &quot;start&quot; something.
        return start(...)
    taskDeferred.addCallback(cbConnected)

    def cbStarted(startResult):
        # Now the Deferred returned by `start´ has fired.
        if someStopCondition:
            # If we decide it is time to stop, then stop.
            return stop(...)
        # Otherwise, run `start´ again
        startAgainDeferred = start(...)
        # And call this callback again with this new call's result.
        startAgainDeferred.addCallback(cbStarted)
        return startAgainDeferred
    taskDeferred.addCallback(cbStarted)

    def cbStopped(stopResult):
        # The only exit from the earlier &quot;loop&quot; is through the code path
        # which calls `stop´.  This callback is called when the Deferred
        # returned by that call fires.  Do the disconnect now.
        return disconnect(...)
    taskDeferred.addCallback(cbStopped)

    def cbDisconnected(disconnectResult):
        print &quot;All done&quot;
    taskDeferred.addCallback(cbDisconnected)

    # It's possible something will go wrong in the above.  To make sure any
    # exceptions are reported, add a logging errback at the very end to
    # display whatever might go wrong.
    taskDeferred.addErrback(twisted.python.log.err)

Hope this helps,

Jean-Paul
