I haven't used it myself, but that sounds a bit like txloadbalancer:

Are you using that?

While every application is a unique beast in terms of performance 
tuning, these numbers all sound surprisingly low to me for something as 
simple as a TCP proxy.

Are you saturating your CPU?  What is the load like on the box in 
question, both from the Twisted proxy and from the other processes?

Can you provide a benchmark that we can run somewhere else, to 
demonstrate the issue you're having?
&gt;<i>My question is are there any &quot;production&quot; settings I need to do

</I>
Nothing that you described will make any use of threads - is there some 
reason you mention threadpool size?

If you *are* using threads then perhaps you shouldn't be, and they're 
causing performance problems :)

However, aside from reactor selection, Twisted is designed to have very 
few knobs to turn; it has one button for performance tuning and we push 
it before it leaves the factory.  So if there's a performance problem, 
the issue is that we need to optimize something in Twisted, or you need 
to optimize something in your application.

You may be able to tweak various linux kernel parameters to be able to 
improve things a bit, but if you're running into problems at 25 
connections, it doesn't sound like you're running into kernel issues to 
me.
