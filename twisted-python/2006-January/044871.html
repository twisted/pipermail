My immediate reaction to this was to worry about maintainability in that
these conversations, just like our docs, will likely eventually stop
being &quot;the right way&quot; to do things.

Repeated experience has shown that we've got very few people (at a
guess, somewhere between 2 and 5 people, comprising about 0.05% in total
of a fulltime worker by time expenditure) who are worried enough about
maintaining the docs to actually do anything about it (and some more who
are willing to point out problems). This kind of thing is hard for
editors to work with -- they have to read through a whole conversation
to find out if any bit of it is out of date, and if so, they're
essentially forced to either turn it into a document or nuke the whole
thing.

Essentially what I'm trying to do here is find a balance between:

 - having lots of up-to-date documentation, even if it's not in a hugely
   friendly form (IRC conversations, for linguistic and social reasons,
   are low bandwidth even when there's meat to the discussion), which is
   a good thing

 - having lots of documentation in an incredible array of hard-to-edit
   forms which is constantly mostly out-of-date, which is a bad thing

For various reasons, mostly idiosyncratic, I tend to be biased towards
having a smaller set of well-maintained well-edited documentation than a
larger set of poorly maintained randomed documentation. But what are
other people's experiences with projects that have particularly good or
particularly bad documentation?
