(A little late jumping into this discussion) C# (and the CLR in
genral), being the better Java that it is, has dynamic functions in
the form of delegates, which can be &quot;bound methods&quot; in the sense that
Python has them. In addition, it has destructors which are very
similar to python's __del__. The CLR's garbage collector will collect
cycles with destructors, unlike Python. This means that destructors in
C# don't always have access to all of their members (some may
&quot;mysteriously&quot; be null, and no order is guaranteed so it will appear
random) because they've already been collected. To complexify the
matter even more, the CLR's garbage collector may (and in windows
does) run in a seperate thread, making safe robust CLR deconstructors
a fine art.
