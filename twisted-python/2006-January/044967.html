<PRE>Thank you. I wonder if I could ask a follow-on question.
  Below is a version of echoclient that seems to work.
  I overrode EchoFactory's __init__ method to initialize the client id
  &quot;generator&quot; to zero and the buildProtocol method to create a protocol
  instance and give that instance its own unique id.  I stop the reactor when the last connection &quot;signs off&quot;.
  
  I'm now wondering: what's the best way to enable the protocol instances  to have different behaviors? Here's my current thinking:  Maybe I  can have EchoFactory pass an appropriate &quot;delegate&quot; object to each  protocol instance so that the implementation of methods such as  connectionMade would be something like this:
  
  def connectionMade(self):
        self.delegate.connectionMade()
  
  The approach I was thinking of using to pass this delegate from  EchoFactory to a protocol instance was something &quot;hokey&quot; like if  next_client_id = 1, then pass to the protocol instance the delegate  object associated with a key of 1 in the dictionary { 1:delegate1,  2:delegate2, ...}.  Are there better approaches available? Again,  thanks for any help or advice!
  
  
  sample code for a multi-connect client:
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  from twisted.internet import reactor, protocol
  
  
  # a client protocol
  
  class EchoClient(protocol.Protocol):
      &quot;&quot;&quot;Once connected, send a message, then print the result.&quot;&quot;&quot;
      
      def __init__(self, id):
          self.id = id
  
      def connectionMade(self):
          self.transport.write(&quot;sender# %d says: hello, world!&quot; % self.id)
      
      def dataReceived(self, data):
          &quot;As soon as any data is received, write it back.&quot;
          print &quot;Server said:&quot;, data
          self.transport.loseConnection()
      
      def connectionLost(self, reason):
          print &quot;connection lost&quot;
          from twisted.internet import reactor
          #reactor.stop()
  
  
  class EchoFactory(protocol.ClientFactory):
      protocol = EchoClient
  
      def __init__(self):
          self.next_client_id = 0
  
      def buildProtocol(self, addr):
          print &quot;buildProtocol called&quot;
          self.next_client_id += 1
          p = self.protocol(self.next_client_id)
          p.factory = self
          return p
  
      def clientConnectionFailed(self, connector, reason):
          print &quot;Connection failed - goodbye!&quot;
          reactor.stop()
      
      def clientConnectionLost(self, connector, reason):
          print &quot;Connection lost - goodbye!&quot;
          print &quot;numPorts= %d&quot; % self.numPorts
          if self.numPorts == 1:
              reactor.stop()
  
  
  # this connects the protocol to a server runing on port 8000
  def main():
      f = EchoFactory()
      reactor.connectTCP(&quot;localhost&quot;, 8000, f)
      reactor.connectTCP(&quot;localhost&quot;, 8000, f)
      reactor.connectTCP(&quot;localhost&quot;, 8000, f)
      reactor.run()
  
  # this only runs if the module was *not* imported
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()

All three connections share DATA ID information, but  should otherwise have &quot;independent&quot; existence so that they can be  configured to have different &quot;behavioral&quot; attributes; that is, the ADD  connection saves the data ids for items successfully persisted to an  'in-memory' table for later lookups, and UPDATE and DELETE requests can  only be issued for DATA IDs known to be valid for the &quot;current&quot; session  (thus, the &quot;in-memory&quot; table lookups) and each connection may have  attributes such as &quot;send&quot; rates, etc.

This  is as easy as calling reactor.connectTCP() three times. There's nothing  special about the first call, or the second call, or the third call.  Each one just sets up a connection attempt.

Try taking echoclient.py from the core examples and adding some more connectTCP calls to it, see what happens.
