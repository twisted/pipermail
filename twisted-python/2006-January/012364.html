</I>&gt;<i>  - having lots of documentation in an incredible array of hard-to-edit

</I>&gt;<i> For various reasons, mostly idiosyncratic, I tend to be biased towards

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think having a small core of well-maintained and well-edited  
documentation is most important.  Without this, users have no clear  
starting point that is reliable.  But there could also be another  
larger documentation set that is available but isn't as up to date or  
particularly well written.  But to have the larger, less reliable set  
with _no_ small set of high quality docs is really silly.

But with all that said, once someone has gotten into Twisted, they  
will end up using the source code as their documentation.  To me,  
this means that doc strings (and the API docs) should always be  
verbose, well-written and up to date.

Thanks for organizing this effort!
