We haven't implemented .tac files for `twist` yet; you can either add that feature :) or you can write a twist plugin.  (It's the same as a twistd plugin.)

Hi ?????,

Thanks for your interest in improving Twisted!  Have a look at
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedDevelopment and then let us know
if you have further questions.

Message-ID: <CAHZAEpfHZ1XaAfA8=RzPjmD7r6Y8B6cx+N4qpkNr+juqiK9cFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Guys,

We've been using proto_helpers.StringTransport for awhile in testing and
recently added TLS support we wanted to test as well. Has anyone subclassed
StringTransport to add startTLS support?

We added the _TLSConnectionMixin, _TLSClientMixin mixins to a new
StringTransportTLS subclass, but its throwing some basic errors we're
crunching through:

'StringTransportTLS' object has no attribute 'protocol'

So I thought I'd see if anyone had any pointers on doing this better. Thank
you in advance.

	some HTTPS sites
Message-ID: <CAFycZ9cVFYDXCf_pqrAL_EA9NyGv8Ya26gNi1Fp3w0v1g=WENg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

It looks like when connected to some  HTTPS servers, the TLS
connection is not successfully closed.

With sites like google.com, the connection is successfully closed.

But with Office365 sharepoint.com sites the TLS shutdown is not completed.

Has anyone else observed this behaviour ?

I have observed this while running some end to end tests in which the
pool.closeCachedConnections() deferred was not called, even after a
generous amount of seconds :)

--------

the TLSMemoryBIOProtocol._tlsConnection.shutdown() will return False
and the connection is left open.

Future calls to tlsConnection will result in WantReadError

>From my understanding WantReadError means that more data needs to be
read and passed to the protocol.

And If I try to read from the raw socket I get this

data = TLSMemoryBIOProtocol.transport.socket.recv(1000)
*** error: [Errno 11] Resource temporarily unavailable

and the socket is never made available  and in the end it is closed with

data = TLSMemoryBIOProtocol.transport.socket.recv(100)
*** error: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer

-----------

Here is a gits with the example code and some example output
https://gist.github.com/adiroiban/346dd455094d1762f0e69e9812309ad6

The gist also contains a patched TLSMemoryBIOProtocol._shutdownTLS
which will close the connection after some time.

PS: TLSMemoryBIOProtocol._tlsConnection.shutdown() make reference to
this issue https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl/issues/91... but the
issue is now closed

Thanks!

The code to abort an HTTP client connection is here:

https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-17.1.0/src/twisted/web/_newclient.py#L1657

This calls loseConnection which for a TLS connection will try to do a TLS
shutdown under most circumstances (in some cases it can't, and will
abortConnection on the underlying transport instead). If the remote end has
stopped responding to the connection, I think this may end up hanging
forever.

I think this code should either call abortConnection directly, or set a
timer which will abort the connection after a little while if a clean
shutdown from loseConnection has not completed yet. I'

I observed something simillar a while ago, there was bug report created for
it in Scrapy. I'm not 100% sure this was same issue as you're discussing
here. Issue in Scrapy: https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/985 fix in
Scrapy https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/999 Author of this PR to
Scrapy also created Twisted ticket
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7738

Hope it helps

twistedmatrix.com's current certificate is issued by StartCom Certification

58.0.3026.3 (canary/dev channel only, currently, but eventually this will
presumably be in a release version) twistedmatrix.com is no longer[1] on
the whitelist, which means that twistedmatrix.com will issue a certificate
error. Can we switch to another CA? (Let's Encrypt, for example; I hear
somebody wrote a Twisted library for using that)

I'm sending this to the general list in case anyone else has been
scratching their head about why they're getting cert warnings.

This is an extremely good idea.

Yeah, this looks right. We hit it in the server side code too: it?s a very unintuitive API in that sense.

I am not sure about which code are we talking here.
The specific HTTP11ClientProtocol which will fix only the HTTP client
part or the generic TLSMemoryBIOProtocol code which might fix any TLS
connection?

I have observed this issue on the server side for the case in which a
TLS connection is opened and then closed  without transferring any
data ... and then the handshake will not have the chance to complete.

I think that this is the same issue which was reported for Scrapy

Message-ID: <CAEeXt4PPaNS_8+h-NKhHryEgpoYbNssP5OMeDjrjZ+iWorKoqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

GitHub apparently allows fast-forward merges to trunk.  Here's an example
of one:

  https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/730

This doesn't seem like a good thing.

   - The ticket is still open
   - There is no merge commit
   - There is no merge commit message
   - There are non-merge commits directly on trunk history (first parent)

  Anyone else have an opinion?

Also, on the same PR, it seems like folks have trouble managing the two
different ways to represent the review states: the "review" keyword in trac
and the accepted/etc status on the GitHub PR.  Maybe there shouldn't be two
different ways to represent this?

Yes please.

This is the rare ops task that will actually be quite easy for someone to add in to Braid as a PR: https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid>

If you have a look at https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/blob/master/services/t-web/twisted-web/ports <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/blob/master/services/t-web/twisted-web/ports> you might be able to guess how such a thing would go...

This is definitely bad, forbidden by existing policy, etc.  In fact I remember adjusting the settings so that the 'merge' button would always create a merge commit; in fact, the configuration is still set that way.

Craig, since you're the one who made this merge, can you explain what happened?  Has github's 'merge' button stopped prompting for a commit message?  Failing to wait for the removal of the 'review' keyword was obviously a mistake, but based on my previous experience with the 'merge' button this wouldn't even be a type of mistake that's _possible_ to make; understanding what you did to trigger it would therefore be very useful.

I don't think this is bad enough to do any major VCS surgery to fix (similar mistakes exist in the history, and both commits to Twisted.Quotes and literally all of the imported SVN history are single-parent), but it is worth doing some work to avoid recurring.

> Also, on the same PR, it seems like folks have trouble managing the two different ways to represent the review states: the "review" keyword in trac and the accepted/etc status on the GitHub PR.  Maybe there shouldn't be two different ways to represent this?

Indeed there should not.  I hope someone has the time to address this soon

The only blocker is that I don't want to lose the notion of a "review queue".  The random mess of works-in-progress, already-reviewed code awaiting feedback, and abandoned experiments that shows up on the default 'pull request' view is not a workable substitute for the relatively short and explicit "I have submitted code that wants a review but hasn't gotten one" list at https://twisted.reviews/ <https://twisted.reviews/>.  However, some combination of Github's new-ish explicit review workflow, (possibly, if necessary) some kind of bot to perform the operations that are mysteriously forbidden to outside contributors, and a custom query could easily do the trick if someone can work it out and document it.

Rebase merging was allowed when I checked earlier, so I disabled it (I
guess I managed to do this before you looked at the configuration). I
suspect that is what happened here, but note also that these settings only
control what is possible by pressing the merge button on GitHub; you can
construct commits locally however you like and push them, as long as you
get green commit statuses for all the mandatory commit checks.

Perhaps I only did this for some other repos, then.  Did I miss your announcement of this?  Hint, hint? :)

Is this true even for people with just repo:write?

I?m talking about the fact that calling TLSMemoryBIOProtocol.loseConnection may not ever actually drop the underlying FD is the surprising part of the code. We had to work around it in the server side by adding a timeout after loseConnection is called to end up calling abortConnection.

 By the time I got to my email client (which admittedly was several hours
after I made the configuration change), your email had arrived, so my reply
ended up being the "announcement" too. The last time I looked at these
settings, rebasing was not allowed, so I guess somebody else turned it on
(possibly by accident); the GitHub audit logs don't go far back enough for
me to check who did it and when, but that means the change happened over
several months ago.

I haven't actually tested this scenario, so I could be mistaken; inferring
from other things it shouldn't matter what your permissions are (for a
non-force push).

Woops, sorry about that.  I pressed the Merge button in git, but I guess I
clicked on the wrong
option after that.  It is good that this is now disabled to prevent future

OK, good to know; so this was a repo misconfiguration coupled with human error.  Glad we have something in place to prevent it now :).

Craig - that said, can you go back and fix up the relevant state (kill the 'review' keyword, close the ticket with a reference to the relevant commit, and so on)?

In order to submit a patch, I am trying to write an automated tests for this.
Were you able to reproduce this issue in a controlled environment.

I am still not fully understanding why I get this behaviour with
sharepoint.com sites.

I am thinking at having a rigged TLS server which will keep the socket
open but will not
respond to the shutdown request.... but I still don't know how :)

Run the server with TLSMemoryBIOProtocol and use the transport's
pauseProducing method before you attempt the shutdown?

Yup, that will work. Similarly, having two TLSMemoryBIOProtocols communicating together and pausing one before calling loseConnection on the other should also work. Essentially, any situation you can conjure where the closing connection will manage not to see either a TLS CloseNotify or a TCP FIN or RST will do the job.

Indeed.  For that matter, you can have them interact in-memory (maybe
StringTransport is good enough as-is, maybe not, I'm not sure) and then
just stop shuttling the bytes in one direction.  (I/O-free tests for the
win)

Hey there --

One way would be to use virtualenv to gather the dependencies without
installing them globally:

mkdir -p ~/venv
virtualenv ~/venv/twisted_docs   # `sudo pip install virtualenv` first if
you don't have this command
source ~/venv/twisted_docs/bin/activate
pip install sphinx twisted
cd <repo>/docs
make html

Looks like Twisted needs to be installed in order to build the docs.

I would suggest using a virtualenv for everything, and installing Twisted
from your checkout into it in it.


python -m virtualenv my_venv   # Python 2

or

python3 -m venv my_venv         # Python 3

source my_venv/bin/activate
#
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/twisted.git Twisted
cd Twisted
python setup.py develop    # this installs Twisted in your virtual env
git remote add upstream https://github.com/twisted/twisted.git
git fetch upstream
git branch -u upstream/trunk trunk
#
pip install sphinx
cd docs
make html

My suggestion would be to use the tox environments for this that we already provide :).

`tox -e apidocs` will build the API documentation, and `tox -e narrativedocs` will build the narrative documentation.  This has the advantage that if we change the required packages for doc-building in the future, these commands will automatically re-build an appropriate virtualenv for the task.

To discover what environments are available, `tox -l`.

Raspbian should be fine, but you do have to have enough dependencies installed.  In this case you need to apt install libffi-dev and openssl-dev; it will be slow to build the first time (for each version of python) but it will speed up a lot after that due to build caching.

(Specifically this is because it is building Cryptography, which does not yet ship a manylinux1 wheel.)

Let me know if that works,

From what I've seen here, it doesn't look like you've done anything wrong - this should work.  So it's going to require some investigation.

I don't know why it would be choosing to 'inst-nodeps' when the deps clearly aren't installed yet.  When I do this, what I see is:

  congratulations :)


So, a few questions for you:

Are you running the latest `tox`? (tox --version == 2.6.0)
This is not the first time you've run 'tox', or it would have the 'narrativedocs create' line above.  Did you see what happened on the earlier runs?  Did they all fail?
Can you try re-creating the virtual environment?  Either `tox -r -e narrativedocs` or `rm -fr build/; tox -e narrativedocs`
Can you try doing this against a 'dev' install, i.e. `tox --develop -e narrativedocs`?
What happens if you make a new virtual environment and do `pip install .../path/to/twisted[dev]` (just .[dev] if you're in the twisted dir)?  Specifically: does sphinx get installed in that virtual environment?
Did you copy this development environment from another machine, or move it to a different folder?

Hopefully we can get to the bottom of this and learn something for future contributors about whatever pitfall you've encountered!

Thanks for your patience,

As I remember, the first 'tox -e narrativedocs' run failed because of missing libffi dependency, so this is possible first step one needs to reproduce the problem with running 'narrativedocs inst-nodeps' instead of 'narrativedocs create'.

You're welcome!  Glad we got you up and running, sorry we couldn't figure out what the problem was.

> One thing that is left unclear to me: the `narrativedocs installed` line in the tox output contains a long list of installed modules. Where were they installed? Because `pip list` doesn't show me them neither for the virtual environment which was active when I run tox nor for the global list.

`tox` is a tool which creates multiple virtualenvs for testing a project in multiple configurations, and for running multiple tasks associated with a project.  (Like, for example, generating narrative documentation.)

Twisted is weird and puts its tox venvs in 'build/<envname>'; normally they're in '.tox/envname'. (see http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9040).  You can find your venv in build/narrativedocs.

Instead of uploading the patch to Trac, it is preferred that you follow the
procedures here, even for a documentation patch.

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedDevelopment#SubmittingaPatch

That includes all the steps for GitHub, Newsfile, setting the "review"
keyword on the Trac ticket, etc.

Thank you for your patience, and contributions to Twisted, especially for
the docs, which is important for new users

Subject: [Twisted-Python] in case there's downtime
Message-ID: <27D41B92-7262-4EC3-BA25-E537971221B2@twistedmatrix.com>

We've been very conservative about upgrading our operating system on twistedmatrix.com <http://twistedmatrix.com/>, since we don't want to disrupt anything.  Since our OS is one release too old to support Docker, that unfortunately means we haven't been able to migrate incrementally to containers, which creates a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem.

However, as we are days away from the end-of-life cliff for the operating system as a whole, and as I discovered a few minutes ago, dozens of packages are already unsupported and not receiving security updates, I'm going to upgrade the host OS manually, even if it results in some disruption.  As with the Twisted compatibility policy, security is a good enough reason to break stuff.

Maybe we'll even get a new version of Mailman that will let me turn automatic subscriptions back on while the star-crossed https://lists.twistedmatrix.com <https://lists.twistedmatrix.com/> project waits for someone else to help out :-).

Hi Chris!

Thanks for volunteering.  If you'd like to help out with infrastructure _generally_, there's a channel on freenode, #twisted-admin, where you can show up to discuss what's going on.

As to mailing lists specifically; over a year ago now, I outlined a plan to migrate our mail infrastructure:

https://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2016-March/030189.html <https://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2016-March/030189.html>

Unfortunately, I never had nearly as much time to work on that as I'd thought I would; also, Mailgun is no longer a product of Rackspace; also, I no longer work at either Rackspace or Mailgun :).  There's also the issue that the service that https://github.com/twisted-infra/lists.twistedmatrix.com/ <https://github.com/twisted-infra/lists.twistedmatrix.com/> deploys to, Carina, is shutting down: https://getcarina.com <https://getcarina.com/>.  So we need to find a new place for it to migrate to if it's going to be a real thing.

However, the generous open-source discount that Mailgun offers to Twisted remains in place.

Originally, I'd been nervous about migrating twistedmatrix.com <http://twistedmatrix.com/> to Mailgun without having an alternate solution in place for mailing lists, because I didn't want to be blasting out any spam that we were generating via mailman and ruining our sender score there.  I was also under the impression that more of the domain-name configuration had to match up in Mailman than actually does; experiments during the latest OS upgrade indicate to me that it's a relatively small configuration change.

Disabling automatic subscriptions does seem to have mitigated that almost completely, and now we're on a recent enough OS that we'll get security updates for mailman, at least.  Plus, Mailgun will give me better visibility than I currently have if we are generating such bad messages.  As such I'll probably migrate our main mail delivery / forwarder pipeline to mailgun later today, allowing us to migrate individual addresses or lists to some other system rather than doing something all at once.

Users with @twistedmatrix.com email addresses will need to get an SMTP password token from me in order to be able to properly send outbound DKIM-signed messages.  I am pretty sure you all have alternate ways of reaching me :-).

If I manage to screw up mail routing so bad that you can't reach me via this mail address, by the way, and you need to report a problem after this move, you can send messages to mail-admin-315569 at glyph.im <mailto:mail-admin-315569 at glyph.im>.

Oops! Mail delivery retries to the rescue :).

Aside from an extremely exciting hour where I accidentally created a suppression for my own address and could not test anything, this went reasonably smoothly.  (Those who might want to help us out with ops: we now exclusively use exim for routing messages to mailman, and maybe delivering some emails from Trac; it no longer sends messages to users.  So we could maybe make a Docker container out of that.)

Hi Team,

Wanted to bring one code changes which is really required from twisted side otherwise it is not behaving  as per RFC (rfc4253 Section 7.2), twisted is failing when we negotiate any kex algorithm based on SHA1 and we have MAC as hmac-sha2-512. The reason for the failure was the below code

hashProcessor = _kex.getHashProcessor(self.kexAlg)
        k1 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + c + self.sessionID)
        k1 = k1.digest()
        k2 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1).digest()
return k1 + k2

For SHA512 we need 64 byte key and if the Kex is based on SHA1 then it will only generate 40 byte key and that induce a failure. So we need to modify the code as below to make it generic and make it comply with RFC (rfc4253 Section 7.2). So that twisted can work irrespective of what kex is been used. Actual code should plot in is like below

hashProcessor = _kex.getHashProcessor(self.kexAlg)
        k1 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + c + self.sessionID)
        k1 = k1.digest()
        k2 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1).digest()
k3 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1 + k2).digest()
k4 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1 + k2 + k3).digest()
return k1 + k2 + k3 + k4

Can somebody help me to plot this fix so that twisted will work fine with all the other servers out there and even make it comply to the RFC. Thanks in advance and this will be my first findings on twisted code ;). Please let me know in case of any doubt on the same. Code changes should be plotted in to  the routine _getKey,  file name is src/twisted/conch/ssh/transport.py . Please help me with this commit team.


Thanks,
Jabir

Thanks Alex for the response. In our server we added support of HMAC-SHA-512 and HMAC-SHA-256 support for MAC. When we try to negotiate this hmac with most of the other client like Paramiko, OpenSSH and other flavours of SSH its working fine. But we are seeing a problem with twisted client that too only with HMAC-SHA-512. We have a limitation from our side to debug this since we don’t know what is happening from the client side. We have taken our derived key for the HMAC and as well as the input to derive the MAC using online tools and it matches with whatever we have generated but whatever is been sent across the other Twisted side differs and we are closing the session. This is been tagged critical since most of the customers are migrating to Twisted and will be a deployment blocker for us.

What we suspect is the key or the algorithm itself. Please see the snippet below

If you see the details this is the useauth first packet and we are not able to proceed because of the failure. We used online tool to do this calculation and we are getting the same output as what we generated so the one marked as red is creating problem.So the root cause could be either the key which is been derived or the algorithm so to debug that we need to enable details logging from client side. We can share the details with respective engineer and show what we are facing. Please help.

Online tool which we used to check our algorithm is: which result in same MAC marked as green.

Hi,

I think I'm missing some context here, what part of twisted are you trying to use SHA-512 for a MAC with? It sounds like Conch? Can you show how I could reproduce the problem?

Hi Team,


Wanted to cross check on SHA 512 algorithm as MAC while using twisted. Few of our customers started using Twisted and even we are trying to incorporate some scripts via twisted client. But what we have noticed is that when we negotiate SHA 512 MAC with twisted we always get a failure and other MAC algorithms are working fine with twisted. So wanted to cross check do we have any bug or any issue with SHA 512 and twisted and how we can debug this from twisted side.

We checked the same with other OpenSSH client and even paramiko things work perfectly fine so wanted to debug further from the twisted side. We checked with the same derived key and the output whatever we got from SHA 512 is what we are getting from the online tool so we suspect something to do with the key or hash algorithm from the other side.

We used the twisted 16.6.0 version for testing, thanks in advance for looking in to this email.



Thanks,

Happy to help.

Here should be the documentation for contributing  (hopefully is up to date)

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedDevelopment

The first thing is to fork twisted/twisted, apply the change on the
branch and then create a PR.

By creating the PR, you will trigger some of the automated tests and
you can get a quick feedback.
.. for example to see if your changes are not introducing any regressions.

In an ideal world before making the changes and creating a simple
example so that we can manually check the changes you start by
updating the existing automated test to make sure that we don't
introduce regressions in the feature (as a non exhaustive list of
reasons)

You can use this file
https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/trunk/docs/conch/examples/sshsimpleserver.py
as the foundation for a simple example.
In the PR you can provide the client-side command use for the manual test

Looking forward for you PR.
I can help with the review and/or writing the automated tests.

You can also find me on #twisted-dev

Adi

Its a security issue even you are allowing a weaker key in case of 64 bytes deriving only 40 bytes. Let me know how we issue a tracker bug can you please guide me. Since don’t want someone else to waist effort in debugging the same issue.

Hi Team,

Wanted to bring one code changes which is really required from twisted side otherwise it is not behaving  as per RFC (rfc4253 Section 7.2), twisted is failing when we negotiate any kex algorithm based on SHA1 and we have MAC as hmac-sha2-512. The reason for the failure was the below code

hashProcessor = _kex.getHashProcessor(self.kexAlg)
        k1 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + c + self.sessionID)
        k1 = k1.digest()
        k2 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1).digest()
return k1 + k2

For SHA512 we need 64 byte key and if the Kex is based on SHA1 then it will only generate 40 byte key and that induce a failure. So we need to modify the code as below to make it generic and make it comply with RFC (rfc4253 Section 7.2). So that twisted can work irrespective of what kex is been used. Actual code should plot in is like below

hashProcessor = _kex.getHashProcessor(self.kexAlg)
        k1 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + c + self.sessionID)
        k1 = k1.digest()
        k2 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1).digest()
k3 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1 + k2).digest()
k4 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1 + k2 + k3).digest()
return k1 + k2 + k3 + k4

Can somebody help me to plot this fix so that twisted will work fine with all the other servers out there and even make it comply to the RFC. Thanks in advance and this will be my first findings on twisted code ;). Please let me know in case of any doubt on the same. Code changes should be plotted in to  the routine _getKey,  file name is src/twisted/conch/ssh/transport.py . Please help me with this commit team.

If you see the details this is the useauth first packet and we are not able to proceed because of the failure. We used online tool to do this calculation and we are getting the same output as what we generated so the one marked as red is creating problem.So the root cause could be either the key which is been derived or the algorithm so to debug that we need to enable details logging from client side. We can share the details with respective engineer and show what we are facing. Please help.

Online tool which we used to check our algorithm is: which result in same MAC marked as green.

Hi,

I think I'm missing some context here, what part of twisted are you trying to use SHA-512 for a MAC with? It sounds like Conch? Can you show how I could reproduce the problem?

Hi Team,


Wanted to cross check on SHA 512 algorithm as MAC while using twisted. Few of our customers started using Twisted and even we are trying to incorporate some scripts via twisted client. But what we have noticed is that when we negotiate SHA 512 MAC with twisted we always get a failure and other MAC algorithms are working fine with twisted. So wanted to cross check do we have any bug or any issue with SHA 512 and twisted and how we can debug this from twisted side.

We checked the same with other OpenSSH client and even paramiko things work perfectly fine so wanted to debug further from the twisted side. We checked with the same derived key and the output whatever we got from SHA 512 is what we are getting from the online tool so we suspect something to do with the key or hash algorithm from the other side.

We used the twisted 16.6.0 version for testing, thanks in advance for looking in to this email.



Thanks,

Jabir

No probs Adi, can you help me to upload the fix to the twisted since I
don¹t know the procedure, if you can guide me that helps. Since I was
pretty sure that this a bug in coding twisted set keys part and not comply
to RFC.


Thanks,

Hi Jabir and sorry for the previous misspelling!

There are a few existing bug reports for KEX related tasks...some are
server side, some are client side

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/search?q=kex

I think that your bug was already reported (by my) at
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/8258

---------

Regarding the help with this patch.

What have you tried so far?
Where are you stuck?
Where/ with what specifically do you need help?

You need to follow the procedure at:

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedDevelopment#SubmittingaPatch

That will give you all the details you need about filing a new ticket in
Trac,
forking the repository on GitHub, doing a GitHub pull request, etc.

If you need more help, you should ask Einar Floystad Dorum, who works at
Cisco and has filed multiple Conch patches
for Twisted:

Subject: [Twisted-Python] automatic subscription should be working again
Message-ID: <B1B9D422-BABF-4ABF-9797-13078FAB4C36@twistedmatrix.com>

The web forms at https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python <https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python> as well as  https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-web <https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-web> should now be accepting web-based subscriptions again.

Right now the configuration has not technically changed - just to be safe, for the first day or two, we're going to leave the administrative-approval check in place on new subscribers, but I think that we have managed to address the main problem that was leading to abuse (usually one spam comes in every couple of seconds, and there hasn't been one for nearly an hour now).  If I don't see any more spammer subscription attempts in the next 24h I will likely make it fully self-service again.  Tell your friends, come join us to talk about Twisted!  (Or Twisted's mailing lists, you know, as we do here.)

This is probably a bigger deal to me than anyone else, since making sure our abysmal mail infrastructure didn't fall over and stop delivering messages to project members or DDoS some poor soul on the other side of the planet has been a grindingly tedious intermittent task for me over the last year.  Processing new subscription requests, and trying to disambiguate them from spammers, has been particularly time-consuming and frustrating; I suspect that a few dozen people who would really prefer to be on this list now have bounced off of the byzantine subscription process in the last six months.

The visibility and confidence that Mailgun's deliverability tracking has given me, plus some Mailman upgrades and configuration changes, should vastly reduce the amount of ongoing work that mail infra maintenance requires for me, so that I can get my PyCon talk done in time this year.  Maybe even fix a Twisted bug or two.

My my very heartfelt thanks to M-jimt on the #mailman IRC channel on Freenode for giving me several tips which lead to this final change.

Thank you all for your patience, and I _really_ hope that this is my last posting about meta-level mailing list junk this year :-).

I'm glad to read this, hopefully I was one of your last manual approvals
and you'll have one thing less to think about ^^.

Thanks for the well-wishes.  It's official; after 24h of no discernible subscription spam, I've re-enabled confirmation-based subscriptions.  So you were one last manual approval and this is the last mailing list meta-post :-).  Let's get back to talking about Twisted!

We haven't implemented .tac files for `twist` yet; you can either add that feature :) or you can write a twist plugin.  (It's the same as a twistd plugin.)

Hi all, 

I have no idea how this bot got subscribed to the list, but, I've unsubscribed and banned them.  Sorry!

I don't know what TruBrain is, but it would be good if it weren't trying to spam this list and getting its messages rejected :).

Hi Роман,

Thanks for your interest in improving Twisted!  Have a look at
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedDevelopment and then let us know
if you have further questions.

Message-ID: <CAHZAEpfHZ1XaAfA8=RzPjmD7r6Y8B6cx+N4qpkNr+juqiK9cFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Guys,

We've been using proto_helpers.StringTransport for awhile in testing and
recently added TLS support we wanted to test as well. Has anyone subclassed
StringTransport to add startTLS support?

We added the _TLSConnectionMixin, _TLSClientMixin mixins to a new
StringTransportTLS subclass, but its throwing some basic errors we're
crunching through:

'StringTransportTLS' object has no attribute 'protocol'

So I thought I'd see if anyone had any pointers on doing this better. Thank
you in advance.

	some HTTPS sites
Message-ID: <CAFycZ9cVFYDXCf_pqrAL_EA9NyGv8Ya26gNi1Fp3w0v1g=WENg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

It looks like when connected to some  HTTPS servers, the TLS
connection is not successfully closed.

With sites like google.com, the connection is successfully closed.

But with Office365 sharepoint.com sites the TLS shutdown is not completed.

Has anyone else observed this behaviour ?

I have observed this while running some end to end tests in which the
pool.closeCachedConnections() deferred was not called, even after a
generous amount of seconds :)

--------

the TLSMemoryBIOProtocol._tlsConnection.shutdown() will return False
and the connection is left open.

Future calls to tlsConnection will result in WantReadError

>From my understanding WantReadError means that more data needs to be
read and passed to the protocol.

And If I try to read from the raw socket I get this

data = TLSMemoryBIOProtocol.transport.socket.recv(1000)
*** error: [Errno 11] Resource temporarily unavailable

and the socket is never made available  and in the end it is closed with

data = TLSMemoryBIOProtocol.transport.socket.recv(100)
*** error: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer

-----------

Here is a gits with the example code and some example output
https://gist.github.com/adiroiban/346dd455094d1762f0e69e9812309ad6

The gist also contains a patched TLSMemoryBIOProtocol._shutdownTLS
which will close the connection after some time.

PS: TLSMemoryBIOProtocol._tlsConnection.shutdown() make reference to
this issue https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl/issues/91... but the
issue is now closed

Thanks!

The code to abort an HTTP client connection is here:

https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-17.1.0/src/twisted/web/_newclient.py#L1657

This calls loseConnection which for a TLS connection will try to do a TLS
shutdown under most circumstances (in some cases it can't, and will
abortConnection on the underlying transport instead). If the remote end has
stopped responding to the connection, I think this may end up hanging
forever.

I think this code should either call abortConnection directly, or set a
timer which will abort the connection after a little while if a clean
shutdown from loseConnection has not completed yet. I'

I observed something simillar a while ago, there was bug report created for
it in Scrapy. I'm not 100% sure this was same issue as you're discussing
here. Issue in Scrapy: https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/985 fix in
Scrapy https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/999 Author of this PR to
Scrapy also created Twisted ticket
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7738

Hope it helps

twistedmatrix.com's current certificate is issued by StartCom Certification

58.0.3026.3 (canary/dev channel only, currently, but eventually this will
presumably be in a release version) twistedmatrix.com is no longer[1] on
the whitelist, which means that twistedmatrix.com will issue a certificate
error. Can we switch to another CA? (Let's Encrypt, for example; I hear
somebody wrote a Twisted library for using that)

I'm sending this to the general list in case anyone else has been
scratching their head about why they're getting cert warnings.

Yeah, this looks right. We hit it in the server side code too: it’s a very unintuitive API in that sense.

I am not sure about which code are we talking here.
The specific HTTP11ClientProtocol which will fix only the HTTP client
part or the generic TLSMemoryBIOProtocol code which might fix any TLS
connection?

I have observed this issue on the server side for the case in which a
TLS connection is opened and then closed  without transferring any
data ... and then the handshake will not have the chance to complete.

I think that this is the same issue which was reported for Scrapy

Message-ID: <CAEeXt4PPaNS_8+h-NKhHryEgpoYbNssP5OMeDjrjZ+iWorKoqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

GitHub apparently allows fast-forward merges to trunk.  Here's an example
of one:

  https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/730

This doesn't seem like a good thing.

   - The ticket is still open
   - There is no merge commit
   - There is no merge commit message
   - There are non-merge commits directly on trunk history (first parent)

  Anyone else have an opinion?

Also, on the same PR, it seems like folks have trouble managing the two
different ways to represent the review states: the "review" keyword in trac
and the accepted/etc status on the GitHub PR.  Maybe there shouldn't be two
different ways to represent this?

Yes please.

This is the rare ops task that will actually be quite easy for someone to add in to Braid as a PR: https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid>

If you have a look at https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/blob/master/services/t-web/twisted-web/ports <https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/blob/master/services/t-web/twisted-web/ports> you might be able to guess how such a thing would go...

This is definitely bad, forbidden by existing policy, etc.  In fact I remember adjusting the settings so that the 'merge' button would always create a merge commit; in fact, the configuration is still set that way.

Craig, since you're the one who made this merge, can you explain what happened?  Has github's 'merge' button stopped prompting for a commit message?  Failing to wait for the removal of the 'review' keyword was obviously a mistake, but based on my previous experience with the 'merge' button this wouldn't even be a type of mistake that's _possible_ to make; understanding what you did to trigger it would therefore be very useful.

I don't think this is bad enough to do any major VCS surgery to fix (similar mistakes exist in the history, and both commits to Twisted.Quotes and literally all of the imported SVN history are single-parent), but it is worth doing some work to avoid recurring.

> Also, on the same PR, it seems like folks have trouble managing the two different ways to represent the review states: the "review" keyword in trac and the accepted/etc status on the GitHub PR.  Maybe there shouldn't be two different ways to represent this?

Indeed there should not.  I hope someone has the time to address this soon

The only blocker is that I don't want to lose the notion of a "review queue".  The random mess of works-in-progress, already-reviewed code awaiting feedback, and abandoned experiments that shows up on the default 'pull request' view is not a workable substitute for the relatively short and explicit "I have submitted code that wants a review but hasn't gotten one" list at https://twisted.reviews/ <https://twisted.reviews/>.  However, some combination of Github's new-ish explicit review workflow, (possibly, if necessary) some kind of bot to perform the operations that are mysteriously forbidden to outside contributors, and a custom query could easily do the trick if someone can work it out and document it.

Rebase merging was allowed when I checked earlier, so I disabled it (I
guess I managed to do this before you looked at the configuration). I
suspect that is what happened here, but note also that these settings only
control what is possible by pressing the merge button on GitHub; you can
construct commits locally however you like and push them, as long as you
get green commit statuses for all the mandatory commit checks.

Perhaps I only did this for some other repos, then.  Did I miss your announcement of this?  Hint, hint? :)

Is this true even for people with just repo:write?

I’m talking about the fact that calling TLSMemoryBIOProtocol.loseConnection may not ever actually drop the underlying FD is the surprising part of the code. We had to work around it in the server side by adding a timeout after loseConnection is called to end up calling abortConnection.

 By the time I got to my email client (which admittedly was several hours
after I made the configuration change), your email had arrived, so my reply
ended up being the "announcement" too. The last time I looked at these
settings, rebasing was not allowed, so I guess somebody else turned it on
(possibly by accident); the GitHub audit logs don't go far back enough for
me to check who did it and when, but that means the change happened over
several months ago.

I haven't actually tested this scenario, so I could be mistaken; inferring
from other things it shouldn't matter what your permissions are (for a
non-force push).

Woops, sorry about that.  I pressed the Merge button in git, but I guess I
clicked on the wrong
option after that.  It is good that this is now disabled to prevent future
mistakes like this.

OK, good to know; so this was a repo misconfiguration coupled with human error.  Glad we have something in place to prevent it now :).

Craig - that said, can you go back and fix up the relevant state (kill the 'review' keyword, close the ticket with a reference to the relevant commit, and so on)?

In order to submit a patch, I am trying to write an automated tests for this.
Were you able to reproduce this issue in a controlled environment.

I am still not fully understanding why I get this behaviour with
sharepoint.com sites.

I am thinking at having a rigged TLS server which will keep the socket
open but will not
respond to the shutdown request.... but I still don't know how :)

Run the server with TLSMemoryBIOProtocol and use the transport's
pauseProducing method before you attempt the shutdown?

Yup, that will work. Similarly, having two TLSMemoryBIOProtocols communicating together and pausing one before calling loseConnection on the other should also work. Essentially, any situation you can conjure where the closing connection will manage not to see either a TLS CloseNotify or a TCP FIN or RST will do the job.

Indeed.  For that matter, you can have them interact in-memory (maybe
StringTransport is good enough as-is, maybe not, I'm not sure) and then
just stop shuttling the bytes in one direction.  (I/O-free tests for the
win)

Hey there --

One way would be to use virtualenv to gather the dependencies without
installing them globally:

mkdir -p ~/venv
virtualenv ~/venv/twisted_docs   # `sudo pip install virtualenv` first if
you don't have this command
source ~/venv/twisted_docs/bin/activate
pip install sphinx twisted
cd <repo>/docs
make html

Looks like Twisted needs to be installed in order to build the docs.

I would suggest using a virtualenv for everything, and installing Twisted
from your checkout into it in it.


python -m virtualenv my_venv   # Python 2

or

python3 -m venv my_venv         # Python 3

source my_venv/bin/activate
#
git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/twisted.git Twisted
cd Twisted
python setup.py develop    # this installs Twisted in your virtual env
git remote add upstream https://github.com/twisted/twisted.git
git fetch upstream
git branch -u upstream/trunk trunk
#
pip install sphinx
cd docs
make html

My suggestion would be to use the tox environments for this that we already provide :).

`tox -e apidocs` will build the API documentation, and `tox -e narrativedocs` will build the narrative documentation.  This has the advantage that if we change the required packages for doc-building in the future, these commands will automatically re-build an appropriate virtualenv for the task.

To discover what environments are available, `tox -l`.

Raspbian should be fine, but you do have to have enough dependencies installed.  In this case you need to apt install libffi-dev and openssl-dev; it will be slow to build the first time (for each version of python) but it will speed up a lot after that due to build caching.

(Specifically this is because it is building Cryptography, which does not yet ship a manylinux1 wheel.)

Let me know if that works,

From what I've seen here, it doesn't look like you've done anything wrong - this should work.  So it's going to require some investigation.

I don't know why it would be choosing to 'inst-nodeps' when the deps clearly aren't installed yet.  When I do this, what I see is:

  congratulations :)


So, a few questions for you:

Are you running the latest `tox`? (tox --version == 2.6.0)
This is not the first time you've run 'tox', or it would have the 'narrativedocs create' line above.  Did you see what happened on the earlier runs?  Did they all fail?
Can you try re-creating the virtual environment?  Either `tox -r -e narrativedocs` or `rm -fr build/; tox -e narrativedocs`
Can you try doing this against a 'dev' install, i.e. `tox --develop -e narrativedocs`?
What happens if you make a new virtual environment and do `pip install .../path/to/twisted[dev]` (just .[dev] if you're in the twisted dir)?  Specifically: does sphinx get installed in that virtual environment?
Did you copy this development environment from another machine, or move it to a different folder?

Hopefully we can get to the bottom of this and learn something for future contributors about whatever pitfall you've encountered!

Thanks for your patience,

-glyph

As I remember, the first 'tox -e narrativedocs' run failed because of missing libffi dependency, so this is possible first step one needs to reproduce the problem with running 'narrativedocs inst-nodeps' instead of 'narrativedocs create'.

You're welcome!  Glad we got you up and running, sorry we couldn't figure out what the problem was.

> One thing that is left unclear to me: the `narrativedocs installed` line in the tox output contains a long list of installed modules. Where were they installed? Because `pip list` doesn't show me them neither for the virtual environment which was active when I run tox nor for the global list.

`tox` is a tool which creates multiple virtualenvs for testing a project in multiple configurations, and for running multiple tasks associated with a project.  (Like, for example, generating narrative documentation.)

Twisted is weird and puts its tox venvs in 'build/<envname>'; normally they're in '.tox/envname'. (see http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9040).  You can find your venv in build/narrativedocs.

Instead of uploading the patch to Trac, it is preferred that you follow the
procedures here, even for a documentation patch.

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedDevelopment#SubmittingaPatch

That includes all the steps for GitHub, Newsfile, setting the "review"
keyword on the Trac ticket, etc.

Thank you for your patience, and contributions to Twisted, especially for
the docs, which is important for new users

I closed the latter as a duplicate.  Feel free to do this (with comments on both tickets, as you can see I put on those) if you find more dups :).

Since our OS is one release too old to support Docker, that unfortunately means we haven't been able to migrate incrementally to containers, which creates a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem.

However, as we are days away from the end-of-life cliff for the operating system as a whole, and as I discovered a few minutes ago, dozens of packages are already unsupported and not receiving security updates, I'm going to upgrade the host OS manually, even if it results in some disruption.  As with the Twisted compatibility policy, security is a good enough reason to break stuff.

Maybe we'll even get a new version of Mailman that will let me turn automatic subscriptions back on while the star-crossed https://lists.twistedmatrix.com <https://lists.twistedmatrix.com/> project waits for someone else to help out :-).

Hi,

What needs taking over on the mailing list side? I'd love to help out if 
possible.

Hi Chris!

Thanks for volunteering.  If you'd like to help out with infrastructure _generally_, there's a channel on freenode, #twisted-admin, where you can show up to discuss what's going on.

As to mailing lists specifically; over a year ago now, I outlined a plan to migrate our mail infrastructure:

https://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2016-March/030189.html <https://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2016-March/030189.html>

Unfortunately, I never had nearly as much time to work on that as I'd thought I would; also, Mailgun is no longer a product of Rackspace; also, I no longer work at either Rackspace or Mailgun :).  There's also the issue that the service that https://github.com/twisted-infra/lists.twistedmatrix.com/ <https://github.com/twisted-infra/lists.twistedmatrix.com/> deploys to, Carina, is shutting down: https://getcarina.com <https://getcarina.com/>.  So we need to find a new place for it to migrate to if it's going to be a real thing.

However, the generous open-source discount that Mailgun offers to Twisted remains in place.

Originally, I'd been nervous about migrating twistedmatrix.com <http://twistedmatrix.com/> to Mailgun without having an alternate solution in place for mailing lists, because I didn't want to be blasting out any spam that we were generating via mailman and ruining our sender score there.  I was also under the impression that more of the domain-name configuration had to match up in Mailman than actually does; experiments during the latest OS upgrade indicate to me that it's a relatively small configuration change.

Disabling automatic subscriptions does seem to have mitigated that almost completely, and now we're on a recent enough OS that we'll get security updates for mailman, at least.  Plus, Mailgun will give me better visibility than I currently have if we are generating such bad messages.  As such I'll probably migrate our main mail delivery / forwarder pipeline to mailgun later today, allowing us to migrate individual addresses or lists to some other system rather than doing something all at once.

Users with @twistedmatrix.com email addresses will need to get an SMTP password token from me in order to be able to properly send outbound DKIM-signed messages.  I am pretty sure you all have alternate ways of reaching me :-).

If I manage to screw up mail routing so bad that you can't reach me via this mail address, by the way, and you need to report a problem after this move, you can send messages to mail-admin-315569 at glyph.im <mailto:mail-admin-315569 at glyph.im>.

Oops! Mail delivery retries to the rescue :).

Aside from an extremely exciting hour where I accidentally created a suppression for my own address and could not test anything, this went reasonably smoothly.  (Those who might want to help us out with ops: we now exclusively use exim for routing messages to mailman, and maybe delivering some emails from Trac; it no longer sends messages to users.  So we could maybe make a Docker container out of that.)

Hi Team,

Wanted to bring one code changes which is really required from twisted side otherwise it is not behaving  as per RFC (rfc4253 Section 7.2), twisted is failing when we negotiate any kex algorithm based on SHA1 and we have MAC as hmac-sha2-512. The reason for the failure was the below code

hashProcessor = _kex.getHashProcessor(self.kexAlg)
        k1 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + c + self.sessionID)
        k1 = k1.digest()
        k2 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1).digest()
return k1 + k2

For SHA512 we need 64 byte key and if the Kex is based on SHA1 then it will only generate 40 byte key and that induce a failure. So we need to modify the code as below to make it generic and make it comply with RFC (rfc4253 Section 7.2). So that twisted can work irrespective of what kex is been used. Actual code should plot in is like below

hashProcessor = _kex.getHashProcessor(self.kexAlg)
        k1 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + c + self.sessionID)
        k1 = k1.digest()
        k2 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1).digest()
k3 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1 + k2).digest()
k4 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1 + k2 + k3).digest()
return k1 + k2 + k3 + k4

Can somebody help me to plot this fix so that twisted will work fine with all the other servers out there and even make it comply to the RFC. Thanks in advance and this will be my first findings on twisted code ;). Please let me know in case of any doubt on the same. Code changes should be plotted in to  the routine _getKey,  file name is src/twisted/conch/ssh/transport.py . Please help me with this commit team.


Thanks,
Jabir

Thanks Alex for the response. In our server we added support of HMAC-SHA-512 and HMAC-SHA-256 support for MAC. When we try to negotiate this hmac with most of the other client like Paramiko, OpenSSH and other flavours of SSH its working fine. But we are seeing a problem with twisted client that too only with HMAC-SHA-512. We have a limitation from our side to debug this since we don’t know what is happening from the client side. We have taken our derived key for the HMAC and as well as the input to derive the MAC using online tools and it matches with whatever we have generated but whatever is been sent across the other Twisted side differs and we are closing the session. This is been tagged critical since most of the customers are migrating to Twisted and will be a deployment blocker for us.

If you see the details this is the useauth first packet and we are not able to proceed because of the failure. We used online tool to do this calculation and we are getting the same output as what we generated so the one marked as red is creating problem.So the root cause could be either the key which is been derived or the algorithm so to debug that we need to enable details logging from client side. We can share the details with respective engineer and show what we are facing. Please help.

Online tool which we used to check our algorithm is: which result in same MAC marked as green.

Hi,

I think I'm missing some context here, what part of twisted are you trying to use SHA-512 for a MAC with? It sounds like Conch? Can you show how I could reproduce the problem?

Hi Team,


Wanted to cross check on SHA 512 algorithm as MAC while using twisted. Few of our customers started using Twisted and even we are trying to incorporate some scripts via twisted client. But what we have noticed is that when we negotiate SHA 512 MAC with twisted we always get a failure and other MAC algorithms are working fine with twisted. So wanted to cross check do we have any bug or any issue with SHA 512 and twisted and how we can debug this from twisted side.

We checked the same with other OpenSSH client and even paramiko things work perfectly fine so wanted to debug further from the twisted side. We checked with the same derived key and the output whatever we got from SHA 512 is what we are getting from the online tool so we suspect something to do with the key or hash algorithm from the other side.

We used the twisted 16.6.0 version for testing, thanks in advance for looking in to this email.



Thanks,

Jabir

Happy to help.

Here should be the documentation for contributing  (hopefully is up to date)

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedDevelopment

The first thing is to fork twisted/twisted, apply the change on the
branch and then create a PR.

By creating the PR, you will trigger some of the automated tests and
you can get a quick feedback.
.. for example to see if your changes are not introducing any regressions.

In an ideal world before making the changes and creating a simple
example so that we can manually check the changes you start by
updating the existing automated test to make sure that we don't
introduce regressions in the feature (as a non exhaustive list of
reasons)

You can use this file
https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/trunk/docs/conch/examples/sshsimpleserver.py
as the foundation for a simple example.
In the PR you can provide the client-side command use for the manual test

Looking forward for you PR.
I can help with the review and/or writing the automated tests.

You can also find me on #twisted-dev

Adi

Its a security issue even you are allowing a weaker key in case of 64 bytes deriving only 40 bytes. Let me know how we issue a tracker bug can you please guide me. Since don’t want someone else to waist effort in debugging the same issue.

This is not a security issue, so this address isn't the right place for this discussion. Please use the public twisted issue tracker.

Hi Team,

Wanted to bring one code changes which is really required from twisted side otherwise it is not behaving  as per RFC (rfc4253 Section 7.2), twisted is failing when we negotiate any kex algorithm based on SHA1 and we have MAC as hmac-sha2-512. The reason for the failure was the below code

hashProcessor = _kex.getHashProcessor(self.kexAlg)
        k1 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + c + self.sessionID)
        k1 = k1.digest()
        k2 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1).digest()
return k1 + k2

For SHA512 we need 64 byte key and if the Kex is based on SHA1 then it will only generate 40 byte key and that induce a failure. So we need to modify the code as below to make it generic and make it comply with RFC (rfc4253 Section 7.2). So that twisted can work irrespective of what kex is been used. Actual code should plot in is like below

hashProcessor = _kex.getHashProcessor(self.kexAlg)
        k1 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + c + self.sessionID)
        k1 = k1.digest()
        k2 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1).digest()
k3 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1 + k2).digest()
k4 = hashProcessor(sharedSecret + exchangeHash + k1 + k2 + k3).digest()
return k1 + k2 + k3 + k4

Can somebody help me to plot this fix so that twisted will work fine with all the other servers out there and even make it comply to the RFC. Thanks in advance and this will be my first findings on twisted code ;). Please let me know in case of any doubt on the same. Code changes should be plotted in to  the routine _getKey,  file name is src/twisted/conch/ssh/transport.py . Please help me with this commit team.

We can share the details with respective engineer and show what we are facing. Please help.

Online tool which we used to check our algorithm is: which result in same MAC marked as green.

Hi,

I think I'm missing some context here, what part of twisted are you trying to use SHA-512 for a MAC with? It sounds like Conch? Can you show how I could reproduce the problem?

So wanted to cross check do we have any bug or any issue with SHA 512 and twisted and how we can debug this from twisted side.

We checked the same with other OpenSSH client and even paramiko things work perfectly fine so wanted to debug further from the twisted side. We checked with the same derived key and the output whatever we got from SHA 512 is what we are getting from the online tool so we suspect something to do with the key or hash algorithm from the other side.

We used the twisted 16.6.0 version for testing, thanks in advance for looking in to this email.

No probs Adi, can you help me to upload the fix to the twisted since I
don¹t know the procedure, if you can guide me that helps. Since I was
pretty sure that this a bug in coding twisted set keys part and not comply
to RFC.

Hi Jabir and sorry for the previous misspelling!

There are a few existing bug reports for KEX related tasks...some are
server side, some are client side

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/search?q=kex

I think that your bug was already reported (by my) at
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/8258

---------

Regarding the help with this patch.

What have you tried so far?
Where are you stuck?
Where/ with what specifically do you need help?



Thanks!

You need to follow the procedure at:

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedDevelopment#SubmittingaPatch

That will give you all the details you need about filing a new ticket in
Trac,
forking the repository on GitHub, doing a GitHub pull request, etc.

If you need more help, you should ask Einar Floystad Dorum, who works at
Cisco and has filed multiple Conch patches
for Twisted:

Can somebody help me to plot this fix so that twisted will work fine with all the other servers out there and even make it comply to the RFC. Thanks in advance and this will be my first findings on twisted code ;). Please let me know in case of any doubt on the same. Code changes should be plotted in to  the routine _getKey,  file name is src/twisted/conch/ssh/transport.py . Please help me with this commit team.


You need to follow the procedure at:

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedDevelopment#SubmittingaPatch

That will give you all the details you need about filing a new ticket in Trac,
forking the repository on GitHub, doing a GitHub pull request, etc.

If you need more help, you should ask Einar Floystad Dorum, who works at Cisco and has filed multiple Conch patches
for Twisted: https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aeinarfd+is%3Aclosed

Subject: [Twisted-Python] automatic subscription should be working again
Message-ID: <B1B9D422-BABF-4ABF-9797-13078FAB4C36@twistedmatrix.com>

The web forms at https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python <https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python> as well as  https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-web <https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-web> should now be accepting web-based subscriptions again.

Right now the configuration has not technically changed - just to be safe, for the first day or two, we're going to leave the administrative-approval check in place on new subscribers, but I think that we have managed to address the main problem that was leading to abuse (usually one spam comes in every couple of seconds, and there hasn't been one for nearly an hour now).  If I don't see any more spammer subscription attempts in the next 24h I will likely make it fully self-service again.  Tell your friends, come join us to talk about Twisted!  (Or Twisted's mailing lists, you know, as we do here.)

This is probably a bigger deal to me than anyone else, since making sure our abysmal mail infrastructure didn't fall over and stop delivering messages to project members or DDoS some poor soul on the other side of the planet has been a grindingly tedious intermittent task for me over the last year.  Processing new subscription requests, and trying to disambiguate them from spammers, has been particularly time-consuming and frustrating; I suspect that a few dozen people who would really prefer to be on this list now have bounced off of the byzantine subscription process in the last six months.

The visibility and confidence that Mailgun's deliverability tracking has given me, plus some Mailman upgrades and configuration changes, should vastly reduce the amount of ongoing work that mail infra maintenance requires for me, so that I can get my PyCon talk done in time this year.  Maybe even fix a Twisted bug or two.

My my very heartfelt thanks to M-jimt on the #mailman IRC channel on Freenode for giving me several tips which lead to this final change.

Thank you all for your patience, and I _really_ hope that this is my last posting about meta-level mailing list junk this year :-).

I'm glad to read this, hopefully I was one of your last manual approvals
and you'll have one thing less to think about ^^.

Best wishes,

Thanks for the well-wishes.  It's official; after 24h of no discernible subscription spam, I've re-enabled confirmation-based subscriptions.  So you were one last manual approval and this is the last mailing list meta-post :-).  Let's get back to talking about Twisted!
