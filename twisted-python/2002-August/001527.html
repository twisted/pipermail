<PRE>I never claimed to be a graphic artist - I'm a developer, not a
designer. But I don't have time to contribute code, so I contributed an
idea.

Glad to hear *someone* liked it. I pulled the page off my site for now.

When I have time, I'll consult with my usability and human factors
colleagues to see if they have any commentary.

I'm curious to know of any popular sites that conform to Glyph's &quot;wish
list&quot; of acceptable web standards.

Regards,
Mark

I think you got the wrong idea -- glyph did say that it was visually
pleasing (or something similar). It was only technical things that he
had criticisms for, and I agree with him full-heartedly. I think it's
sexy as well, it just needs to be hacked on to be not so blatantly
platform-dependant.

I think it looks awesome, but I agree with glyph's points. Is there any
chance you'll address some of the points he made? I can't say I'll be
able to help much, but I'd like to (and surely others would be able to
lend a hand here and there).

I thought this point was funny, considering the existing site uses
tables for formatting as well ;-)
