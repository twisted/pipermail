Hi Mark,

On Sat, 24 Aug 2002 22:40:13 -0400, &quot;Mark A. Richman&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">mark at markrichman.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> I never claimed to be a graphic artist - I'm a developer, not a
</I>&gt;<i> designer. But I don't have time to contribute code, so I contributed an

</I>
I started off with a few qualifications because I wanted to make it clear that
while I had issues with the way the initial foray looked, I didn't think that
the idea of redoing the website was a bad one, and certainly your idea was not
an aesthetic disaster.  I think it needs some cleanup and tweaking, and I'd
like to see alternate ideas, but I would really like to see you keep throwing a
few spare minutes at it.  Nonetheless, the last time I redesigned the website,
there were *still* some Twisted developers who consider the current layout to
be &quot;too cluttered&quot; :-).

&gt;<i> When I have time, I'll consult with my usability and human factors
</I>&gt;<i> colleagues to see if they have any commentary.
</I>
That would be very cool :).  Actual domain knowledge is certainly better than
my opinions.  (Keep in mind that only half of my concerns are about human
factors: the other half are about automated agents.  Very few people seem to be
thinking seriously about how those work with web designs these days.)

&gt;<i> I'm curious to know of any popular sites that conform to Glyph's &quot;wish
</I>&gt;<i> list&quot; of acceptable web standards.
</I>
Almost zero.  Of course, most of the web (especially the &quot;popular web&quot;) is pure
tripe, so I don't think this says anything in particular.  Google does,
CritLink does, dmoz does, and Citeseer does.  Those are all sites I use
joyfully.  Travelocity doesn't, and I grit my teeth every time I have to wade
through it.  Web comics are particularly bad, and more than a few times I've
written a grabber script so I didn't have to wait for the extra 300k of HTML to
download with each 2k image.

If &quot;most popular websites&quot; look a certain way, then it seems that looking that
way would imply that we aspire only to mediocrity.
