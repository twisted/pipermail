	Not really. You'll notice that Deferred addCallbacks
	handlers returning Deferreds is handled differently
	from d.callback(Deferred()); the former gets special
	treatment, the latter doesn't.

	Your version never outputs &quot;1&quot;, it outputs repr(d2)
	for the callLater version and repr(d) for the immediate
	one.

	My version outputs &quot;1&quot; for the immediate case and
	repr(d2) for the callLater version.

&gt;<i> Consider what happens to your first Deferred, d, with that line
</I>&gt;<i> uncommented:
</I>&gt;<i>   d = defer.Deferred()      # 1. Create it
</I>&gt;<i>   d.callback(d2)            # 2. call it with some value (d2)
</I>&gt;<i>   reactor.callLater(....)   # 3. this doesn't happen yet
</I>&gt;<i>   d.addCallback(....)       # 4. this fires *immediately*, and writes
</I>&gt;<i>                                  the value from 2., which is d2
</I>
	Yes, but only because you modified it to be such.

&gt;<i> So that's why it prints the Deferred in that case.  Now back the way the
</I>&gt;<i> code is originally:
</I>&gt;<i>   d = defer.Deferred()      # 1. Create it
</I>&gt;<i>   d.callback(d2)            # 2. call it with some value (d2)
</I>&gt;<i>   d2.callback(1)            # 3. call d2 with another value (1)
</I>&gt;<i>   d.addCallback(....)       # 4. this fires *immediately*, and writes 
</I>&gt;<i>                                  the value from 2. -- which is 1???
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That does confuse me.  Somehow, if a callback has a result which is
</I>&gt;<i> another Deferred, it does something special to automatically call that
</I>&gt;<i> Deferred, which I didn't realise and seems nasty to me.  I thought that
</I>&gt;<i> was only meant to happen if you explicitly called chainDeferred?
</I>
	Yes, exactly. And I'm asking why this mechanism doesn't
	work with callLater.

&gt;<i> I've just re-read doc/howto/defer and I see that this is in fact
</I>&gt;<i> explained under the heading &quot;Chain Deferreds&quot;, but I'm still curious as
</I>&gt;<i> to why this behaviour is necessary... &quot;explicit is better than
</I>&gt;<i> implicit&quot;, etc :)
</I>
	And it can't be emulated with chainDeferred, for the simple
	reason of needing to hold both Deferreds at once. The thing
	registered with addCallback doesn't have a reference to the
	Deferred it is added to, and it could be added to many
	Deferreds.


	Handy:

def foo(dummy):
	d2=Deferred()
	do_something(d2)
	return d2

d=Deferred()
d.addCallback(foo)


	Cumbersome:

def foo(dummy, d):
	d2=Deferred()
	do_something(d2)
	d2.chainDeferred(d)
	return dummy

d=Deferred()
d.addCallback(foo, d)


	Plus, it allows you to use more things as callbacks; many
	information retrieval funcs return either the wanted result
	or a Deferred. They are very nice to use as callbacks,
	chaining them to retrieve values for each other.

&gt;<i> Anyway, I hope you now understand why that code behaves the way it
</I>&gt;<i> does...
</I>
	No, I don't. You only managed to miss the point :)
