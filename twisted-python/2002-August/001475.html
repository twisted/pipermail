Sorry for being so dense but, what do you mean by this? Does file access count 
as blocking (my gut says &quot;yes&quot;)? How would you handle that? In the twisted 
system in general, from what I understand of it, classes are instantiated to 
handle client requests. If those instances access files or in-memory data 
objects it is conceivable that two instances might be accessing the same data 
/ file, right? But from you you say, this is fine since there is only one 
thread. But what do you mean by blocking calls should only be run in the main 
loop? Is the above (file access) blocking? And is it, as the case stated 
above &quot;within the main loop&quot;?
