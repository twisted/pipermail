I think you got the wrong idea -- glyph did say that it was visually
pleasing (or something similar). It was only technical things that he
had criticisms for, and I agree with him full-heartedly. I think it's
sexy as well, it just needs to be hacked on to be not so blatantly
platform-dependant.

I think it looks awesome, but I agree with glyph's points. Is there any
chance you'll address some of the points he made? I can't say I'll be
able to help much, but I'd like to (and surely others would be able to
lend a hand here and there).

I thought this point was funny, considering the existing site uses
tables for formatting as well ;-)
