Hello all,

I have written a nice twisted-based TCP-server as a twistd plugin or an
application as a .tac file and I would like to run it as a windows service.

Hi Thomas:
Recommend you take a look at this service manager utility for Windows:
    <A HREF="https://nssm.cc/">https://nssm.cc/</A>
We've moved away from implementing Twisted as a service and instead run it under NSSM. 
NSSM provides additional capabilities such as automatic restarts on failure, redirected stdout/stderr, and easily setting dependency groups, etc.
Our Twisted binaries are installed at a number of fairly large companies and so far none of them have had any concern about running the NSSM service manager. 
Its made our life much simpler. 
(Lousy product name, though...)

Thank you very much for the feedback. It seems not very pythonic to install a helper to generate a service. At the end of the day if it is robust then I will go for it. I would prefer a solution which would be installable via pip nicely. Just run pip install, then it will have a separate module which will then install the windows service and that's it.

Thinking about making twisted easier to use in a windows environment this could be worth to include in the standard installation of twisted.
