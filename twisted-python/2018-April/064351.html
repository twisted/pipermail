<PRE>Hello all,

I have written a nice twisted-based TCP-server as a twistd plugin or an 
application as a .tac file and I would like to run it as a windows service.

It works when started from cmd.exe but I would like to run it as a native 
service.

I have seen that the pywin32 package has a win32serviceutil module which could 
be used for this. Unfortunately I do not know how to get it up and running.

I have seen several posts here on this list about this topic but it is still 
unclear how to use it. For my understanding one has to mimic the life-cycle 
management of the process which twist(d) does in the windows service.

Once it has been figured out I would love to clean it all up and add it to 
twisted's documentation.


Thanks for your help,
Thomas
