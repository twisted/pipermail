Message-ID: <CA+1iZEfZz2UKjwgy8WRNHbH-rm-KPzJ=s4Qk9KpCZa6F+g-TQQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am attempting to install Twisted 18.4.0  on a clean system, fresh install
of Python 3.7.  When I attempt to install from the source dist (python
setup.py install) it complains I don't have the MS Visual C++ Build tools
("error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required. Get it with "Microsoft
Visual C++ Build Tools"") and directs me to
http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools - which is a 404.

"pip install twisted[windows_platform]" fails for the same reason.

Not sure where to go for a good compiler here ... any ideas? Is it too soon
to adopt Python 3.7?  Should I go back to 3.6? (this is going to be a
system install so I'd prefer to avoid all virtualenv entanglements)

TIA,

Jeff

I installed the compiler package indicated here:
https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers (section titled "Microsoft
Visual C++ 14.0 standalone: Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017 (x86, x64,
ARM, ARM64)") and get a bunch of this:

d:\programs\python37\include\pystate.h(209): note: see declaration of '_ts'

(there was more but this is the gist of it).

Really strongly pointing back at Python 3.7 at this point but it's not
where I usually live so ...

Aaaand, installed Python 3.6.6 and pip install'd Twisted 18.4.0 without any
problems.   So much for getting those sweet performance improvements in 3.7
for now - Twisted is an absolute requirement, 3.7 is not.

Anyways, looks like there's a compatibility issue between 3.7 and Twisted
on Windows at this point.  Anything I can to do assist in troublshooting,
lmk.  I'll be glad to help if I can do it.   I'm completely lost in the
woods where this kind of stuff is concerned.

Regards,

Jeff

Twisted does not yet support Python 3.7. Due to syntax changes and other
changes, as well as the non-availability of build infrastructure at this
moment (e.g. it doesn't work on Travis, we haven't tried appveyor), we
can't yet fully identify what's wrong and fix it with confidence.

I would suggest sticking with 3.6 until at least 3.7.1 rolls around, by
which time it's likely that Twisted and other projects have had time to
catch up.

Thanks for the confirmation, Amber.  Settling down with 3.6.6 install.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted 18.7.0rc1 Release Candidate Announcement
Message-ID: <CAMxb2iv51Vx=fZsG2T2wccOuQP+M6A8s-+CPPEEc9fwS4ZqWEg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone, from scenic Heathrow airport. It's time for another Twisted
release, and this one has got some goodies. Included in this release are:

- better support for async/await coroutines in regards to exception and
traceback handling;
- better support for reporting tracebacks in inlineCallbacks, now showing
what you would expect in synchronous-like code
- the epoll reactor now no longer hard-locks when running out of file
descriptors
- directory rendering in t.web works on Python 2 again
- manhole's colouriser is better at handling Unicode
- setting the groundwork for Python 3.7 support. Note that Python 3.7 is
currently not a supported platform on any operating system, and may
completely fail to install, especially on Windows.

You can get this hot, fresh Twisted for testing through PyPI:

pip install Twisted==18.7.0rc1

You can read the full changelog here:

https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/release-18.7.0-9475/NEWS.rst

Please do some testing, and if all goes well, 18.7 will release proper in a
week.

- Amber

Noticed a documentation issue with #9387 (see #9479) and as I was
preparing a patch for it, I noticed that it implemented `samesite` as an
argument which AFAIU is in violation of Twisted coding style.

Just to illustrate: the same method has another parameter called
`httpOnly` and one called `max_age`. Having `samesite` adds yet a third
style to the same method.
AFAIU, the Naming Convention suggests it should be `sameSite` instead.

Opened another ticket for that (#9480). Since once this is released,
it's pretty much un-changable, I would think it's release critical;
"Release blocker: Regression" sounded like the most suitable tag.

See Pull Request: https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1036

Hmm. It does look like in most other contexts this is presented as two words: https://caniuse.com/#search=samesite <https://caniuse.com/#search=samesite> so I think I agree with Evilham; let's fix it now.

Thanks for paying such close attention to detail!

Appveyor is very slow, so I don't have time to sit around and wait, but this is provisionally approved to land whenever someone comes along to see that CI is actually passing.

I have a minor PR that was reviewed and labeled "cleared to land" a
while back, but three months have passed since then and it's still
unmerged. Is there something else I need to do to move this along, or
did it just fall through the cracks?

Wim.

Hi Wim,

Can you include a link to to the issue in question?  Probably someone (me?) intended to indicate that it was in the appropriate workflow state for landing, but was waiting for continuous integration to complete, and wandered off and forgot about it.  If you can pester a contributor here, or on IRC, someone should be able to land it for you.

Speaking of which, it seems like you've been a fairly stalwart and patient external contributor.  Would you like to join the project as a member and merge your own approved stuff to trunk?  Mostly, the attendant responsibilities are documented here:

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReviewProcess <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReviewProcess>

(This used to be the authoritative list - https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CommitterCheckList <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CommitterCheckList> - and I've just updated it to remove some extraneous stuff, but it seems that pervasive cultural understanding of github's workflow have obviated the need for repetitive stern cautions that one should not commit directly to trunk without code review and CI...)

Hi all,

Perhaps it was https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/991? It was
tagged "cleared to land", but had build failures unrelated to the
changes. I merged forward, pushed to branch, kicked a failing build, and
got the green checkmark. It has been merged.
Perhaps we should avoid the "cleared to land" label on PRs from non-
committers? I scan through open PRs for ones which require a procedural
nudge now and again, but I had not looked at this one as the process
appeared to be done with it, and I missed that it was from a non-
committer.
Also, yes, welcome Wim!

---Tom

Hah, it was Mark, not me!  Score!

Thanks for driving this to completion, Tom!  Much appreciated.

For future reference though, when landing stuff on trunk, please use this format exactly:

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReviewProcess#Authors:Howtomergethechangetotrunk <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReviewProcess#Authors:Howtomergethechangetotrunk>

This helps with both automatically closing the associated Trac ticket (I already did that in this case) and properly attributing credit for reviewer points on https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/ <https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/>.

> Perhaps we should avoid the "cleared to land" label on PRs from non-committers? I scan through open PRs for ones which require a procedural nudge now and again, but I had not looked at this one as the process appeared to be done with it, and I missed that it was from a non-committer.

Ideally it would be used sparingly, but, the availability of such a process release-valve allows someone to do a review even if they only have time to read the code, and not the time to sit around waiting 40 minutes for some intermittent CI nonsense to shake out.

Since this doesn't have a https://twisted.reviews/ <https://twisted.reviews/> -like "core gameplay loop" that project members regularly visit, perhaps if you're going to use this label you should always shoot a message to this list as well, to let other contributors know that they should take a look if they have a minute?

On that note, it looks like https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1010 <https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1010> has suffered the same fate?  Any other committers have a minute to land that one? :)

I always forget the format and then I have to search previous commits or wiki.

We make reference to the Trac ticket in PR title, Branch Name, PR
description (As part of checklist).

Do we really need to make another reference in the merge commit?
For me, it's red tape.

I don't think that we should make things more complicated, just to
have a functional https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/

https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1010 was merged now.

Do we really need and up to date branch before a merge?

I was thinking that with the "clear to land" label, we can have a
robot which checks for the PR and once all tests are green, the robot
will automatically merge based on
https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#merge-a-pull-request-merge-button

The robot can also auto-update with 'trunk/master' a PR with clear to land.

I am happy to work at automation and improving the Twisted PR process.

For example, I have this PR https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1011

It only touches  .circleci/config.yml .... why should we block or wait
for the merge/review of this PR due to random failures on Buildbot?

-----

BTW. Do we need to run the documentation tests on Buildbot?
There are some documentation tests on Circle-CI. Is that not enough ?

If we forget every so often, it's not a big deal, but I find it's nice to have a generally consistent merge format.  I do really wish that Github could do this in the same way that it does for a PR template so we didn't have to remember manually.

This sounds like a great idea, and is very close to what I would do if I had time for working on automation :).

Rather than using the "clear to land" label, however, I'd probably do this on the basis of a passing review from a project member being present, and a passing build.  (The "clear to land" convention predates Github native code reviews.)

> The robot can also auto-update with 'trunk/master' a PR with clear to land.

I know you're not a huge fan of Trac either - it would be a nice touch if the robot here could also notice Github reviews and delete the 'review' keyword; this would keep our highscores and stats stuff working, but eliminate a manual step for reviewers :).

It looks like this is another case of  twisted.python.test.test_sendmsg.CModuleSendmsgTests.test_shortsend messing up our build results.

> BTW. Do we need to run the documentation tests on Buildbot?

I don't think that this should be a required check on buildbot; we definitely shouldn't block on it, especially for bugfixes, but one of the advantages of the buildbot check as opposed to the CircleCI/Travis checks is that the Buildbot check uploads an artifact.  If you look at https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/documentation/builds/4071 <https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/documentation/builds/4071> for example, you can see that the .tar.bz2 files under the last 2 steps are downloadable, and you can crack them open to look at the index.html inside and see what the built docs actually look like.  Sadly we haven't had a lot of doc PRs lately, but I do use this occasionally.

If we can host built artifacts with Travis or Circle somehow then we could just get rid of this.

Ah, sorry. It looks like I've done this a few times. I had wondered why
my points weren't changing.
A template would be nice, if only as a reminder, but I think that I will
always struggle with this if I use the GitHub UI to merge --- no other
project to which I contribute has requirements w.r.t. the merge commit
message, so I am fighting habit. I'll look into scripting it.
As an aside, could you update "<comma_separated_names>" in the merge
commit message example to "<comma_separated_github_usernames>"? I always
have to look at the repository history to see if this is supposed to be
full names or Trac/GitHub handles.

The GitHub UI currently requires this for non-admins, though it can be
bypassed with a manual merge, much like the requirement for a green
build. As a new committer I haven't felt comfortable doing that bypass,
so I spend a lot of time merging forward and kicking builds to get a
green check mark. Should I be bothering? Particularly for documentation
changes[1]. I'd rather spend that time on work product than process.

I think we'd still need a label or other explicit indicator that an
automatic merge should occur, or we won't be able to leave a passing
review which suggests trivial fixes. "Please fix this typo, then merge"
reviews are pretty common.

Yes, let's also add/remove remove the "review required" label on GitHub
or it ends up[2] out of sync[3]. :)
Have you seen the Bors approach[4]? Roughly, Bors is a bot which merges
a PR to the mainline on a temporary branch, runs the tests, and then fast-
forwards the mainline if they pass. If we took that approach we'd not
have to manually merge forward all the time.

This failure has been wasting a lot of time over the past two months. I
think that we should disable this test on Travis until we have a proper
fix. It still runs on Buildbot, no? Buggy tests are worse than no
tests, as they let one portion of the project prevent forward progress
on all others.
The rhel7-py27-coverage builder seems to be having issues downloading
packages from PyPI, too. Fortunately it fails fast and the queue is
usually short so it's a quick to kick:

On the one hand it saddens me that contributors are having their time wasted by this pointless pacifying of CI machines.  On the other hand, to echo your sentiment of "buggy tests are worse than no tests", I think that there's no point to having CI at all unless we're paying attention to it, so I would wholeheartedly support the deletion or skipping of any tests that are causing real problems.

Hmm.  Fair point there.  Label it is.

"review requested" is pretty close to this state; I don't think this one needs a custom label? :)

This looks super interesting.  I would definitely like to have a commit queue, so that we don't have to sit around manually waiting on CI, but we don't have to reduce our CI coverage platforms (especially for alternate kernels, which it's really Twisted's job to cope with).

Please go ahead and disable this test everywhere.  The test itself must be buggy, if it doesn't work in the Travis environment where presumably sendmsg actually works fine.  (Also, this is a 27-only test and if we wait long enough before fixing any underlying issue we can probably just delete it...)

Message-ID: <CAEeXt4O8iDEWkPb558kX2hmiMCe4FygELO8kFLB3LJazw8-JEA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm happy to announce a new project, subunitreporter
<https://pypi.org/project/subunitreporter/>, which provides a reporter
plugin for Trial which emits subunit v2 output.

Twisted includes a subunit v1 reporter for Trial.  However, the v1 output
format must generally be converted to the v2 format before much can be done
with it.  Additionally, the reporter included with Twisted does not include
timing information.  The output generated by subunitreporter does include
this information.

One useful thing to do with a subunit v2 stream is convert it to junitxml
and let CircleCI ingest it.  This is precisely the reason I've written this
reporter.  You can see this in action on some recent Tahoe-LAFS builds.  In
all cases, builds now include a summary of the number of tests run.

Additionally:
    On success <https://circleci.com/gh/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/438>, slowest
test are reported.
    On failure <https://circleci.com/gh/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/379>, the
failing tests and their failure details are summarized.
    Further analysis and reporting
<https://circleci.com/build-insights/gh/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/master> is
also done.

I find this to be a nice development convenience when using CircleCI.
Other build systems are likely to be able to use either the subunit v2
output or (like CircleCI) the equivalent junitxml which can trivially be
produced from the subunit v2 output.

My thanks to Least Authority TFA GmbH <https://leastauthority.com/> for
sponsoring these specific Tahoe-LAFS infrastructure improvements as well as
the subunitreporter project.

Enjoy,
Jean-Paul

Good point! Setting the "review" keyword in Trac should automatically
request a review from twisted/twisted-contributors. Adding a review
should remove the "review" keyword from Trac and add a comment to the
ticket which points at the review. Does that sound correct?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Form based auth - problem with credential checker
Message-ID: <CABnb5sHnnAtJUqoALvCetBckaTTPks1i5U6hmmFMoHuxK9KzzA@mail.gmail.com>

I've posted code here:

credential checker -->
https://gist.github.com/minskmaz/ab218d7b137b24ede8ffc7e3ea6e2392#file-credentialchecker-py

realm.py -->
https://gist.github.com/minskmaz/ab218d7b137b24ede8ffc7e3ea6e2392#file-realm-py

session wrapper -->
https://gist.github.com/minskmaz/ab218d7b137b24ede8ffc7e3ea6e2392#file-webauthsessionwrapper-py

As I point out on line 14 of realm.py the checker is matching a password
against the db but its requestAvatarId (line 10 of *credentialChecker.py *
<https://gist.github.com/minskmaz/ab218d7b137b24ede8ffc7e3ea6e2392#file-credentialchecker-py>)
is returning None to requestAvatar

Any guidance warmly welcomed.

Hello,

The server that hosts twistedmatrix.com will be down for maintenance on Wednesday July 18th.  Our hosting company, Tummy.com, will be increasing the size of the /boot partition to accommodate the larger kernels typical of modern Linux distributions.  This requires a full reload of all partitions' data.

The downtime is expected to be 24 hours, or through Thursday, July 19th.  During the downtime no twistedmatrix.com sites will be available.

Because Trac will be down, no pull requests should be merged between July 18th and 19th.

Twisted's documentation will be inaccessible during that time as well.

Note that this is the minimum maintenance necessary to keep twistedmatrix.com running.  We need money to realize improvements to our infrastructure, like newer hardware for the existing server and additional hosts that could continue to serve twistedmatrix.com during a maintenance window.

Tax-deductible donations can be made to Twisted via the Software Freedom Conservancy.  More information is available here: https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedSoftwareFoundation#HowtoDonate

Hi Jonah!

Can these examples be made into SSCCEs <http://www.sscce.org <http://www.sscce.org/>>?  They're missing all their imports and, for example, replacing the database calls with some succeeded/failed Deferreds?  I'd love to help but I'd rather not debug a bunch of zope component lookups (I'm assuming that's what getUtility is) and DB queries that are irrelevant to the problem at hand :).

DNS could be pointed at an S3-backed website to serve a maintenance
message, at least.  Not optimal, but better than ECONNREFUSED I would
think.  I'd be happy to set this up and foot the bill - if someone provides
the content (I can make web pages but no one really wants that).

Do we need fancy content?

I was thinking to just use a plain text message explaining what is
going on there.

--------

There is also the option to host in Azure. Twisted has $120 each month
for Azure services... so there will be no extra payment.

Let me know if you want/need access to the Twisted Azure subscription.

Azure Blob does not have a "default page"...so you need to set up a
CDN to serve a static page out of a container.

There is one easy way to create a site from a GitHub repo with Azure
App Service:

I've not used Azure before.  Cheaper for me to pay the AWS bill than learn
a different cloud. :)

Hi Jonah,

I commented on your Gist.  tl;dr - your requestAvatarId method isn’t returning the Deferred you create for the database query, to which your callback is attached.

Hope this helps,

Daniel

Please do so!

Although keep in mind that it is the DNS primary as well, so you'll have to update it with enough of a buffer that the secondary has cached the address by the time it goes offline.

I could also set this up on a Data Center in Switzerland; without
spending a penny :).
Only TLS is kind of a thing though, I'd probably generate LE certs to
keep visitors happy and promise to delete those after the maintenance
time-window.
It'd make sense if that's kind of a no-go ^^.

If it does sound like sth to do, just let me know in advance and I'll
set up the thing + be available to trigger LE cert generation as soon as
DNS is set up.
(In that case, I noticed twistedmatrix.com doesn't have HSTS headers, so
note to self: do not set those up :-D)


As for content, I have a placeholder I've used in the past, which I've
adapted to Twisted. Feel free to use/modify/not use at will.

Thanks.  That content is way better than I would have done.  I've put it up
at
http://2a28c83f-1613-4f82-a99c-cf7ca21326f8.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
just to see.

The TLS issue will be the same on AWS as you mentioned.  If the maintenance
site is to have HTTPS (which seems clearly to be the case) and we host on
AWS then I'll also need a certificate.  AWS CertManager would probably be
the way to go for this.

I probably already have access to all the things I need to get a new
certificate issued.  I'm happy to go ahead and complete the AWS setup if
that sounds good to everyone else.

Whichever way we go, thanks for the placeholder content and the offer to
host it, Evilham.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted 18.7 Release Announcement
Message-ID: <a5a094d7-e359-6cb4-fddd-221bd0507726@atleastfornow.net>

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am honoured to announce the 
release of Twisted 18.7!

The highlights of this release are:

- better support for async/await coroutines in regards to exception and 
traceback handling;
- better support for reporting tracebacks in inlineCallbacks, now 
showing what you would expect in synchronous-like code
- the epoll reactor now no longer hard-locks when running out of file 
descriptors
- directory rendering in t.web works on Python 2 again
- manhole's colouriser is better at handling Unicode
- setting the groundwork for Python 3.7 support. Note that Python 3.7 is 
currently not a supported platform on any operating system, and may 
completely fail to install, especially on Windows.

For more information, check the NEWS file (link provided below).

You can find the downloads at <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted> (or 
alternatively <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads>). The NEWS 
file is also available at 
<https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-18.7.0/NEWS>.

Many thanks to everyone who had a part in this release - the supporters 
of the Twisted Software Foundation, the developers who contributed code 
as well as documentation, and all the people building great things with 
Twisted!

Twisted Regards,
Amber Brown (HawkOwl)

after I wrote. (Thanks Tom!)

I'd be honored. At the very least I could re-trigger CI builds when
they fail... :)

(I should say that I've been contributing more to Twisted lately
because I'm working on a project using it, and I'll probably have much
less time for Twisted development once that project is put to
bed. Until the next project, I suppose.)

Congratulations.  You should have an email which, when you click the link on it, will make it official.

Use your powers only for good, never for evil.

This email is at Glyph's request (see the review).  I've made the
requested changes and, aside from a pre-existing twistedchecker bug, all
tests are passing.  7927 is again ready for review.

The PR is here:

https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1039

Ticket is here:

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7927

As with the last review, I will try to incorporate any comments quickly.
This should be helpful to new Twisted users as the default logger will
actually print tracebacks.

Cheers,
-Jason

For starters, this is a picture of you trying to install Twisted on Python 3.7, which we do not yet support.  I've filed https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9502#ticket <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9502#ticket> as an umbrella ticket and created a new milestone for this to make it clearer.

Have you tried on 3.6?

I get dumb errors trying to back out the 3.7 interpreter and adding in the
3.6...Invalid Python SDK. This is is so stupid. These things never work
then you install seven gagillion things to work around what a waste.

Ryan. Usually bleeding edge python distributions are not supported on large
code bases for a number of months. This is because a good deal of testing
must occur before folks trust it in production. It's a good thing you only
gain by using a previous version - even python 2.7. I suggest following
Moshez' tutorial for dockerizing  twisted apps. It is the right way to
package and distribute your twisted and might make it easier for you in the
short term. https://github.com/moshez/sayhello

Hope it helps.

I understand that this is frustrating (and I've put more of my life than I care to think into trying to make this kind of thing less frustrating) but please keep in mind that everyone on this list is a volunteer.  We would like you to have a positive experience with Twisted, but given that you are probably using 600 other pieces of technology at the same time (by the look of it: Windows, PyCharm, Django, Django Channels, Visual Studio, and so on) it's difficult for us to provide immediate authoritative answers that will work in your exact situation.

However, If you can be patient and try to explain more exactly what's going wrong, I'm sure that we can either get you back up and running with Twisted or direct you to a support forum that is more suited to where the problem actually lies.

now its saying i need dockers but I need to work at a fortune 500 company
to purchase and install Dockers.

All I want to do i learn and run DJANGO and Run this tutorial.
https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/part_2.html



I spend 2 days on things that dont even work and its a waste of time.

I mean I get it and appreciate it but this is a big way not to have people
use your products.

Ryan here's the free version of docker to install.

https://www.docker.com/community-edition

After you have that running try this:

https://github.com/zerok/channels-in-docker

The three lines to run it are at the bottom of the page. You'll need to
learn more about docker as it's a big part of the development process and
makes things a lot easier.

Docker doesn’t work with windows 8. I talked to the developer. Andrew Goodwin.

I don’t have the budget to upgrade. 

I appreciate the help. 2 days of my life I will never get back.


Thanks for all the help.

As a backup to installing docker directly you might try vagrant which will
work on windows 8 then install docker inside a vagrant image (in
virtualbox)

There's almost always a way

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrQsxCPT2s
https://www.vagrantup.com/

But alas, sometimes development failures are a good thing. It shows you
what your limits are and where your time might be better spent.

Anyways good luck!

theres just always some snag b/c of all this module importing thats
supposed to make django easy so you have this repository via pip thats just
cluttered with crap.

Dependices are a problem...moving parts. computers have too many moving
parts and interactions and layers and layers of crap.

and thats not even evniormnet stuff like linux vs mac vs windows. its a
guessing game on what to download. and its much easier just to bitch about
it. I think because no one really knows..everyone just kinda struggles
though the dark with a light and hopes for the best.

On Windows 8, you can use Docker Toolbox instead, which should function just fine for what you're trying to do.

Is that screenshot just… literally a list of everything on PyPI?  That is a very strange decision on the part of the PyCharm developers.  (I can't imagine who would want to look at it that way; I can assure you most professional Python developers don't.)

Message-ID: <CA+1iZEfZz2UKjwgy8WRNHbH-rm-KPzJ=s4Qk9KpCZa6F+g-TQQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am attempting to install Twisted 18.4.0  on a clean system, fresh install
of Python 3.7.  When I attempt to install from the source dist (python
setup.py install) it complains I don't have the MS Visual C++ Build tools
("error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required. Get it with "Microsoft
Visual C++ Build Tools"") and directs me to
http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools - which is a 404.

"pip install twisted[windows_platform]" fails for the same reason.

Not sure where to go for a good compiler here ... any ideas? Is it too soon
to adopt Python 3.7?  Should I go back to 3.6? (this is going to be a
system install so I'd prefer to avoid all virtualenv entanglements)

TIA,

Jeff

Visual C++ 14.0 standalone: Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017 (x86, x64,
ARM, ARM64)") and get a bunch of this:

(there was more but this is the gist of it).

Really strongly pointing back at Python 3.7 at this point but it's not
where I usually live so ...

Aaaand, installed Python 3.6.6 and pip install'd Twisted 18.4.0 without any
problems.   So much for getting those sweet performance improvements in 3.7
for now - Twisted is an absolute requirement, 3.7 is not.

Anyways, looks like there's a compatibility issue between 3.7 and Twisted
on Windows at this point.  Anything I can to do assist in troublshooting,
lmk.  I'll be glad to help if I can do it.   I'm completely lost in the
woods where this kind of stuff is concerned.

Regards,

Jeff

Twisted does not yet support Python 3.7. Due to syntax changes and other
changes, as well as the non-availability of build infrastructure at this
moment (e.g. it doesn't work on Travis, we haven't tried appveyor), we
can't yet fully identify what's wrong and fix it with confidence.

I would suggest sticking with 3.6 until at least 3.7.1 rolls around, by
which time it's likely that Twisted and other projects have had time to
catch up.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted 18.7.0rc1 Release Candidate Announcement
Message-ID: <CAMxb2iv51Vx=fZsG2T2wccOuQP+M6A8s-+CPPEEc9fwS4ZqWEg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone, from scenic Heathrow airport. It's time for another Twisted
release, and this one has got some goodies. Included in this release are:

- better support for async/await coroutines in regards to exception and
traceback handling;
- better support for reporting tracebacks in inlineCallbacks, now showing
what you would expect in synchronous-like code
- the epoll reactor now no longer hard-locks when running out of file
descriptors
- directory rendering in t.web works on Python 2 again
- manhole's colouriser is better at handling Unicode
- setting the groundwork for Python 3.7 support. Note that Python 3.7 is
currently not a supported platform on any operating system, and may
completely fail to install, especially on Windows.

You can get this hot, fresh Twisted for testing through PyPI:

pip install Twisted==18.7.0rc1

You can read the full changelog here:

https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/release-18.7.0-9475/NEWS.rst

Please do some testing, and if all goes well, 18.7 will release proper in a
week.

- Amber

Noticed a documentation issue with #9387 (see #9479) and as I was
preparing a patch for it, I noticed that it implemented `samesite` as an
argument which AFAIU is in violation of Twisted coding style.

Just to illustrate: the same method has another parameter called
`httpOnly` and one called `max_age`. Having `samesite` adds yet a third
style to the same method.
AFAIU, the Naming Convention suggests it should be `sameSite` instead.

Opened another ticket for that (#9480). Since once this is released,
it's pretty much un-changable, I would think it's release critical;
"Release blocker: Regression" sounded like the most suitable tag.

See Pull Request: https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1036

Hmm. It does look like in most other contexts this is presented as two words: https://caniuse.com/#search=samesite <https://caniuse.com/#search=samesite> so I think I agree with Evilham; let's fix it now.

Thanks for paying such close attention to detail!

Appveyor is very slow, so I don't have time to sit around and wait, but this is provisionally approved to land whenever someone comes along to see that CI is actually passing.

I have a minor PR that was reviewed and labeled "cleared to land" a

unmerged. Is there something else I need to do to move this along, or
did it just fall through the cracks?

Hi Wim,

Can you include a link to to the issue in question?  Probably someone (me?) intended to indicate that it was in the appropriate workflow state for landing, but was waiting for continuous integration to complete, and wandered off and forgot about it.  If you can pester a contributor here, or on IRC, someone should be able to land it for you.

Speaking of which, it seems like you've been a fairly stalwart and patient external contributor.  Would you like to join the project as a member and merge your own approved stuff to trunk?  Mostly, the attendant responsibilities are documented here:

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReviewProcess <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReviewProcess>

(This used to be the authoritative list - https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CommitterCheckList <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/CommitterCheckList> - and I've just updated it to remove some extraneous stuff, but it seems that pervasive cultural understanding of github's workflow have obviated the need for repetitive stern cautions that one should not commit directly to trunk without code review and CI...)

Hi all,

Perhaps it was https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/991? It was
tagged "cleared to land", but had build failures unrelated to the
changes. I merged forward, pushed to branch, kicked a failing build, and
got the green checkmark. It has been merged.
Perhaps we should avoid the "cleared to land" label on PRs from non-
committers? I scan through open PRs for ones which require a procedural
nudge now and again, but I had not looked at this one as the process
appeared to be done with it, and I missed that it was from a non-
committer.
Also, yes, welcome Wim!

---Tom

Hah, it was Mark, not me!  Score!

> It was tagged "cleared to land", but had build failures unrelated to the changes. I merged forward, pushed to branch, kicked a failing build, and got the green checkmark. It has been merged.

Thanks for driving this to completion, Tom!  Much appreciated.

For future reference though, when landing stuff on trunk, please use this format exactly:

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReviewProcess#Authors:Howtomergethechangetotrunk <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ReviewProcess#Authors:Howtomergethechangetotrunk>

This helps with both automatically closing the associated Trac ticket (I already did that in this case) and properly attributing credit for reviewer points on https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/ <https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/>.

> Perhaps we should avoid the "cleared to land" label on PRs from non-committers? I scan through open PRs for ones which require a procedural nudge now and again, but I had not looked at this one as the process appeared to be done with it, and I missed that it was from a non-committer.

Ideally it would be used sparingly, but, the availability of such a process release-valve allows someone to do a review even if they only have time to read the code, and not the time to sit around waiting 40 minutes for some intermittent CI nonsense to shake out.

Since this doesn't have a https://twisted.reviews/ <https://twisted.reviews/> -like "core gameplay loop" that project members regularly visit, perhaps if you're going to use this label you should always shoot a message to this list as well, to let other contributors know that they should take a look if they have a minute?

On that note, it looks like https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1010 <https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1010> has suffered the same fate?  Any other committers have a minute to land that one? :)

I always forget the format and then I have to search previous commits or wiki.

We make reference to the Trac ticket in PR title, Branch Name, PR
description (As part of checklist).

Do we really need to make another reference in the merge commit?
For me, it's red tape.

I don't think that we should make things more complicated, just to
have a functional https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/

https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1010 was merged now.

Do we really need and up to date branch before a merge?

I was thinking that with the "clear to land" label, we can have a
robot which checks for the PR and once all tests are green, the robot
will automatically merge based on
https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#merge-a-pull-request-merge-button

The robot can also auto-update with 'trunk/master' a PR with clear to land.

I am happy to work at automation and improving the Twisted PR process.

For example, I have this PR https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1011

It only touches  .circleci/config.yml .... why should we block or wait
for the merge/review of this PR due to random failures on Buildbot?

-----

BTW. Do we need to run the documentation tests on Buildbot?
There are some documentation tests on Circle-CI. Is that not enough ?

If we forget every so often, it's not a big deal, but I find it's nice to have a generally consistent merge format.  I do really wish that Github could do this in the same way that it does for a PR template so we didn't have to remember manually.

This sounds like a great idea, and is very close to what I would do if I had time for working on automation :).

Rather than using the "clear to land" label, however, I'd probably do this on the basis of a passing review from a project member being present, and a passing build.  (The "clear to land" convention predates Github native code reviews.)

> The robot can also auto-update with 'trunk/master' a PR with clear to land.

> I am happy to work at automation and improving the Twisted PR process.

I know you're not a huge fan of Trac either - it would be a nice touch if the robot here could also notice Github reviews and delete the 'review' keyword; this would keep our highscores and stats stuff working, but eliminate a manual step for reviewers :).

It looks like this is another case of  twisted.python.test.test_sendmsg.CModuleSendmsgTests.test_shortsend messing up our build results.

> BTW. Do we need to run the documentation tests on Buildbot?

I don't think that this should be a required check on buildbot; we definitely shouldn't block on it, especially for bugfixes, but one of the advantages of the buildbot check as opposed to the CircleCI/Travis checks is that the Buildbot check uploads an artifact.  If you look at https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/documentation/builds/4071 <https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/documentation/builds/4071> for example, you can see that the .tar.bz2 files under the last 2 steps are downloadable, and you can crack them open to look at the index.html inside and see what the built docs actually look like.  Sadly we haven't had a lot of doc PRs lately, but I do use this occasionally.

If we can host built artifacts with Travis or Circle somehow then we could just get rid of this.

Ah, sorry. It looks like I've done this a few times. I had wondered why
my points weren't changing.
A template would be nice, if only as a reminder, but I think that I will
always struggle with this if I use the GitHub UI to merge --- no other
project to which I contribute has requirements w.r.t. the merge commit
message, so I am fighting habit. I'll look into scripting it.
As an aside, could you update "<comma_separated_names>" in the merge
commit message example to "<comma_separated_github_usernames>"? I always
have to look at the repository history to see if this is supposed to be
full names or Trac/GitHub handles.

The GitHub UI currently requires this for non-admins, though it can be
bypassed with a manual merge, much like the requirement for a green
build. As a new committer I haven't felt comfortable doing that bypass,
so I spend a lot of time merging forward and kicking builds to get a
green check mark. Should I be bothering? Particularly for documentation
changes[1]. I'd rather spend that time on work product than process.

I think we'd still need a label or other explicit indicator that an
automatic merge should occur, or we won't be able to leave a passing
review which suggests trivial fixes. "Please fix this typo, then merge"
reviews are pretty common.

Yes, let's also add/remove remove the "review required" label on GitHub
or it ends up[2] out of sync[3]. :)
Have you seen the Bors approach[4]? Roughly, Bors is a bot which merges
a PR to the mainline on a temporary branch, runs the tests, and then fast-
forwards the mainline if they pass. If we took that approach we'd not
have to manually merge forward all the time.

This failure has been wasting a lot of time over the past two months. I
think that we should disable this test on Travis until we have a proper
fix. It still runs on Buildbot, no? Buggy tests are worse than no
tests, as they let one portion of the project prevent forward progress
on all others.
The rhel7-py27-coverage builder seems to be having issues downloading
packages from PyPI, too. Fortunately it fails fast and the queue is
usually short so it's a quick to kick:

I've just made you a trac admin, so you should be able to have at it :-).

On the one hand it saddens me that contributors are having their time wasted by this pointless pacifying of CI machines.  On the other hand, to echo your sentiment of "buggy tests are worse than no tests", I think that there's no point to having CI at all unless we're paying attention to it, so I would wholeheartedly support the deletion or skipping of any tests that are causing real problems.

Hmm.  Fair point there.  Label it is.

"review requested" is pretty close to this state; I don't think this one needs a custom label? :)

This looks super interesting.  I would definitely like to have a commit queue, so that we don't have to sit around manually waiting on CI, but we don't have to reduce our CI coverage platforms (especially for alternate kernels, which it's really Twisted's job to cope with).

Please go ahead and disable this test everywhere.  The test itself must be buggy, if it doesn't work in the Travis environment where presumably sendmsg actually works fine.  (Also, this is a 27-only test and if we wait long enough before fixing any underlying issue we can probably just delete it...)

Message-ID: <CAEeXt4O8iDEWkPb558kX2hmiMCe4FygELO8kFLB3LJazw8-JEA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm happy to announce a new project, subunitreporter
<https://pypi.org/project/subunitreporter/>, which provides a reporter
plugin for Trial which emits subunit v2 output.

Twisted includes a subunit v1 reporter for Trial.  However, the v1 output
format must generally be converted to the v2 format before much can be done
with it.  Additionally, the reporter included with Twisted does not include
timing information.  The output generated by subunitreporter does include
this information.

One useful thing to do with a subunit v2 stream is convert it to junitxml
and let CircleCI ingest it.  This is precisely the reason I've written this
reporter.  You can see this in action on some recent Tahoe-LAFS builds.  In
all cases, builds now include a summary of the number of tests run.

Additionally:
    On success <https://circleci.com/gh/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/438>, slowest
test are reported.
    On failure <https://circleci.com/gh/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/379>, the
failing tests and their failure details are summarized.
    Further analysis and reporting
<https://circleci.com/build-insights/gh/tahoe-lafs/tahoe-lafs/master> is
also done.

I find this to be a nice development convenience when using CircleCI.
Other build systems are likely to be able to use either the subunit v2
output or (like CircleCI) the equivalent junitxml which can trivially be
produced from the subunit v2 output.

My thanks to Least Authority TFA GmbH <https://leastauthority.com/> for
sponsoring these specific Tahoe-LAFS infrastructure improvements as well as
the subunitreporter project.

Enjoy,
Jean-Paul

Good point! Setting the "review" keyword in Trac should automatically
request a review from twisted/twisted-contributors. Adding a review
should remove the "review" keyword from Trac and add a comment to the
ticket which points at the review. Does that sound correct?

As I point out on line 14 of realm.py the checker is matching a password
against the db but its requestAvatarId (line 10 of *credentialChecker.py *
<https://gist.github.com/minskmaz/ab218d7b137b24ede8ffc7e3ea6e2392#file-credentialchecker-py>)

Any guidance warmly welcomed.

Hello,

The server that hosts twistedmatrix.com will be down for maintenance on Wednesday July 18th.  Our hosting company, Tummy.com, will be increasing the size of the /boot partition to accommodate the larger kernels typical of modern Linux distributions.  This requires a full reload of all partitions' data.

The downtime is expected to be 24 hours, or through Thursday, July 19th.  During the downtime no twistedmatrix.com sites will be available.

Because Trac will be down, no pull requests should be merged between July 18th and 19th.

Twisted's documentation will be inaccessible during that time as well.

Note that this is the minimum maintenance necessary to keep twistedmatrix.com running.  We need money to realize improvements to our infrastructure, like newer hardware for the existing server and additional hosts that could continue to serve twistedmatrix.com during a maintenance window.

Tax-deductible donations can be made to Twisted via the Software Freedom Conservancy.  More information is available here: https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedSoftwareFoundation#HowtoDonate

Hi Jonah!

Can these examples be made into SSCCEs <http://www.sscce.org <http://www.sscce.org/>>?  They're missing all their imports and, for example, replacing the database calls with some succeeded/failed Deferreds?  I'd love to help but I'd rather not debug a bunch of zope component lookups (I'm assuming that's what getUtility is) and DB queries that are irrelevant to the problem at hand :).

DNS could be pointed at an S3-backed website to serve a maintenance
message, at least.  Not optimal, but better than ECONNREFUSED I would
think.  I'd be happy to set this up and foot the bill - if someone provides
the content (I can make web pages but no one really wants that).

Do we need fancy content?

I was thinking to just use a plain text message explaining what is
going on there.

--------

There is also the option to host in Azure. Twisted has $120 each month
for Azure services... so there will be no extra payment.

Let me know if you want/need access to the Twisted Azure subscription.

Azure Blob does not have a "default page"...so you need to set up a
CDN to serve a static page out of a container.

There is one easy way to create a site from a GitHub repo with Azure
App Service:

I've not used Azure before.  Cheaper for me to pay the AWS bill than learn
a different cloud. :)

Hi Jonah,

I commented on your Gist.  tl;dr - your requestAvatarId method isn’t returning the Deferred you create for the database query, to which your callback is attached.

Hope this helps,

Daniel

Please do so!

Although keep in mind that it is the DNS primary as well, so you'll have to update it with enough of a buffer that the secondary has cached the address by the time it goes offline.

I could also set this up on a Data Center in Switzerland; without
spending a penny :).
Only TLS is kind of a thing though, I'd probably generate LE certs to
keep visitors happy and promise to delete those after the maintenance
time-window.
It'd make sense if that's kind of a no-go ^^.

If it does sound like sth to do, just let me know in advance and I'll
set up the thing + be available to trigger LE cert generation as soon as
DNS is set up.
(In that case, I noticed twistedmatrix.com doesn't have HSTS headers, so
note to self: do not set those up :-D)


As for content, I have a placeholder I've used in the past, which I've
adapted to Twisted. Feel free to use/modify/not use at will.

Thanks.  That content is way better than I would have done.  I've put it up
at
http://2a28c83f-1613-4f82-a99c-cf7ca21326f8.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
just to see.

The TLS issue will be the same on AWS as you mentioned.  If the maintenance
site is to have HTTPS (which seems clearly to be the case) and we host on
AWS then I'll also need a certificate.  AWS CertManager would probably be
the way to go for this.

I probably already have access to all the things I need to get a new
certificate issued.  I'm happy to go ahead and complete the AWS setup if
that sounds good to everyone else.

Whichever way we go, thanks for the placeholder content and the offer to
host it, Evilham.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted 18.7 Release Announcement
Message-ID: <a5a094d7-e359-6cb4-fddd-221bd0507726@atleastfornow.net>

On behalf of Twisted Matrix Laboratories, I am honoured to announce the 
release of Twisted 18.7!

The highlights of this release are:

- better support for async/await coroutines in regards to exception and 
traceback handling;
- better support for reporting tracebacks in inlineCallbacks, now 
showing what you would expect in synchronous-like code
- the epoll reactor now no longer hard-locks when running out of file 
descriptors
- directory rendering in t.web works on Python 2 again
- manhole's colouriser is better at handling Unicode
- setting the groundwork for Python 3.7 support. Note that Python 3.7 is 
currently not a supported platform on any operating system, and may 
completely fail to install, especially on Windows.

For more information, check the NEWS file (link provided below).

You can find the downloads at <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Twisted> (or 
alternatively <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads>). The NEWS 
file is also available at 
<https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-18.7.0/NEWS>.

Many thanks to everyone who had a part in this release - the supporters 
of the Twisted Software Foundation, the developers who contributed code 
as well as documentation, and all the people building great things with 
Twisted!

Twisted Regards,
Amber Brown (HawkOwl)

Sorry, it was trac 9413 / github 991, which Tom Most helpfully merged
after I wrote. (Thanks Tom!)

I'd be honored. At the very least I could re-trigger CI builds when
they fail... :)

(I should say that I've been contributing more to Twisted lately
because I'm working on a project using it, and I'll probably have much
less time for Twisted development once that project is put to
bed. Until the next project, I suppose.)

Congratulations.  You should have an email which, when you click the link on it, will make it official.

Use your powers only for good, never for evil.

This email is at Glyph's request (see the review).  I've made the
requested changes and, aside from a pre-existing twistedchecker bug, all
tests are passing.  7927 is again ready for review.

The PR is here:

https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1039

Ticket is here:

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7927

As with the last review, I will try to incorporate any comments quickly.
This should be helpful to new Twisted users as the default logger will
actually print tracebacks.

Cheers,
-Jason

For starters, this is a picture of you trying to install Twisted on Python 3.7, which we do not yet support.  I've filed https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9502#ticket <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9502#ticket> as an umbrella ticket and created a new milestone for this to make it clearer.

Have you tried on 3.6?

I get dumb errors trying to back out the 3.7 interpreter and adding in the
3.6...Invalid Python SDK. This is is so stupid. These things never work
then you install seven gagillion things to work around what a waste.

Ryan. Usually bleeding edge python distributions are not supported on large
code bases for a number of months. This is because a good deal of testing
must occur before folks trust it in production. It's a good thing you only
gain by using a previous version - even python 2.7. I suggest following
Moshez' tutorial for dockerizing  twisted apps. It is the right way to
package and distribute your twisted and might make it easier for you in the
short term. https://github.com/moshez/sayhello

Hope it helps.

I understand that this is frustrating (and I've put more of my life than I care to think into trying to make this kind of thing less frustrating) but please keep in mind that everyone on this list is a volunteer.  We would like you to have a positive experience with Twisted, but given that you are probably using 600 other pieces of technology at the same time (by the look of it: Windows, PyCharm, Django, Django Channels, Visual Studio, and so on) it's difficult for us to provide immediate authoritative answers that will work in your exact situation.

However, If you can be patient and try to explain more exactly what's going wrong, I'm sure that we can either get you back up and running with Twisted or direct you to a support forum that is more suited to where the problem actually lies.

now its saying i need dockers but I need to work at a fortune 500 company
to purchase and install Dockers.

All I want to do i learn and run DJANGO and Run this tutorial.
https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/part_2.html



I spend 2 days on things that dont even work and its a waste of time.

I mean I get it and appreciate it but this is a big way not to have people
use your products.

Ryan here's the free version of docker to install.

https://www.docker.com/community-edition

After you have that running try this:

https://github.com/zerok/channels-in-docker

The three lines to run it are at the bottom of the page. You'll need to
learn more about docker as it's a big part of the development process and
makes things a lot easier.

Docker doesn’t work with windows 8. I talked to the developer. Andrew Goodwin.

I don’t have the budget to upgrade. 

I appreciate the help. 2 days of my life I will never get back.


Thanks for all the help.

As a backup to installing docker directly you might try vagrant which will
work on windows 8 then install docker inside a vagrant image (in
virtualbox)

There's almost always a way

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZrQsxCPT2s
https://www.vagrantup.com/

But alas, sometimes development failures are a good thing. It shows you
what your limits are and where your time might be better spent.

Anyways good luck!

theres just always some snag b/c of all this module importing thats
supposed to make django easy so you have this repository via pip thats just
cluttered with crap.

Dependices are a problem...moving parts. computers have too many moving
parts and interactions and layers and layers of crap.

and thats not even evniormnet stuff like linux vs mac vs windows. its a
guessing game on what to download. and its much easier just to bitch about
it. I think because no one really knows..everyone just kinda struggles
