<PRE>Hi Glyph, and thank you for your thorough and very helpful response. :)

&gt;<i> It sounds like this is a pretty trivial application of the Publish/Subscribe

&gt;<i>  Add one general-purpose

</I>&gt;<i>  Then when your getProcessOutput() finishes, just do 'for something in
</I>&gt;<i> self.observers: something.youJustGotServerStatus(newServerStatus)'.
</I>Yes! Perfect! That sounds like it's exactly what I need, thank you :)

&gt;<i>It
</I>&gt;<i> usually makes sense to define an interface with a couple of interesting
</I>&gt;<i> methods when you do this, so that you can have more methods.
</I>Interfaces scare me, and I've been doing my best to avoid them in my
application. The primary reason being that I am the only developer, so
as long as I know what I'm doing I'll be alright. Although I'm not so
sure that I actually do...

&gt;<i> Please, please do not use t.p.hook.  I hope that we delete it one day.
</I>Thanks for the advice. I'll stay away.

&gt;&gt;<i> I hope this was somewhat comprehensible, and that there is an elegant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution out there. :)
</I>&gt;<i> Well, if my answer answers your question, then yes :).
</I>It certainly does, and it is much appreciated. I'll just pop out on
Google for a few minutes to find some examples, and will get right
back to coding my app. Thanks again for taking the time to help a
novice out :)

Cheers,
Einar
