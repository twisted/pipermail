It is waiting for the deferred you return to callback/errback.

This, I found, was initially non-obvious. I assumed that LoopingCall 
would be called every N seconds regardless, but it won't. If you return 
a deferred, the LoopingCall will stop until the deferred 
callback/errback's, then it will be restarted.

This is very useful in some circumstances.

Because this is (apparently) a bug in the underlying Twisted code, so 
anything you do to fix that is a hack.

The quickest way I can describe it is this; as I understand, any Twisted 
function which returns a deferred should never raise an Exception. The 
exception should instead flow down the errback.

This is because (as you've discovered) there are circumstances when a 
function is called in Twisted where the exception can't propagate &quot;up&quot; 
to the caller, because the caller is no longer higher in the call stack. 
Most prominent is reactor.callLater.

&gt;<i> resilient to failure in a scheduled task. Yes, of course I want to fix
</I>&gt;<i> that failure, but I don't want a failure in one scheduled task to
</I>&gt;<i> prevent any further scheduled tasks from being executed...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I suggested another way (fix the broken code, or at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least supply enough information for someone else to fix it).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For all I know, it's already fixed in a newer version of Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> (unfortunately, I can't move this project to a newer version of Twisted)
</I>&gt;<i> but once I have a robust scheduler, I'll certainly do my best to report
</I>&gt;<i> the underlying failure to you guys properly...
</I>
If you can produce a short example that uses the real Twisted API which 
fails, people might a) be able to find/fix the bug and b) suggest a less 
hacky way of ensuring you see the error.
