Great, glad to help :).

</I>
There are some cool implementation things you can do with interfaces, but they're a little obscure and you shouldn't worry about them.  It's most helpful to think of interfaces as just expanded / shared docstrings for things that are shared among many classes.

&gt;&gt;<i> Please, please do not use t.p.hook.  I hope that we delete it one day.
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the advice. I'll stay away.
</I>
Even greater.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I hope this was somewhat comprehensible, and that there is an elegant
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> solution out there. :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, if my answer answers your question, then yes :).
</I>&gt;<i> It certainly does, and it is much appreciated. I'll just pop out on
</I>&gt;<i> Google for a few minutes to find some examples, and will get right
</I>&gt;<i> back to coding my app. Thanks again for taking the time to help a
</I>&gt;<i> novice out :)
</I>
It's always nice to have the help be appreciated.  Good luck!
