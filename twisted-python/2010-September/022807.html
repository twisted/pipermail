</I>Actually, it's *exactly* what you did. As mentioned, I posted your
solution from April :)

I suppose you can call my reiteration of Landreville's solution my
recommendation. If not based on any extensive experience with Twisted
in any way, then at least based on me finding a solution that works
for me :) Unfortunately, the level of Twisted sophistication I'm
currently at, and also my current requirements for my application,
which only needs to do a couple of SOAP-calls because of one of the
services it interfaces to, leads me to simply having to find a
solution that &quot;just works&quot; rather than develop a better one than what
can be currently done with solutions such as the one mentioned.

Anyways: My application performs the SOAP calls nicely now, and I have
moved on to other issues. Such as the persistent obscurity of
inheritance versus interfaces and adapters. For a guy that has no
experience in object-oriented programming, Twisted has a rather steep
learning-curve. But I'm getting there, thanks to both this list and
the community at large.

Cheers,
Einar
