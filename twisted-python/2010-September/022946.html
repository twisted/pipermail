Yes, that's what I thought, which is why I was confused to keep on 
getting &quot;fix the code&quot; responses when I'd already pointed out it wasn't 
my code to fix, and I'd like to build a solution that caters even for 
this eventually...

&gt;<i> You can add a log observer that handles isError=True log messages.
</I>
Okay, and this would mean that my `loop` function from the example I 
posted would keep getting called by LoopingCall?

&gt;<i> You can write a 'safetyBelt' function that catches the exception and does something with it.
</I>
 From my original example, I'm pretty sure that's what my `loop` 
function is; I'm confused as to why it catches a GeneratorExit when the 
attribute error is indirectly raised in the `doStuff` function, and more 
confused that even thought the GeneratorExit has been caught, the calls 
to `loop` from LoopingCall cease...

&gt;<i> You can always invoke your code with maybeDeferred, which will turn exceptions into failures for you.
</I>
In &quot;the real app&quot;, we have another layer or two between doStuff and 
Break, one of which does call down with maybeDeferred, doesn't make any 
difference...

&gt;<i> You can use inlineCallbacks, where in 'x = yield y()', y() raising an exception and y() returning a failed Deferred are basically indistinguishable to the caller.
</I>
Yes, as you can see, this is what `loop` does. In &quot;the real app&quot;, 
doStuff is actually @inlineCallbacks as well, the level below that calls 
with a maybeDeferred and so yes, doing this, same result...

&gt;<i> Why would you say there's no way?
</I>
Because I haven't found any permutation that doesn't result in the 
LoopingCall's calls to `loop` from stopping after the exception.

I would be more than ecstatic to be proved wrong ;-)
