Here's one: the log / trial interaction sucks (which, gulp, I wrote -- 
but hey, this was ancient history before log.py improved :). Trial sets 
things up so that when log.err() occurs, it raises an error -- which is 
reasonable, but the way you have to handle that error, and the way it's 
implemented, is pretty lame.

It should be refactored to use a log observer, not special code in 
log.py (ignoreErrors, flushErrors, clearIgnores, and part of err).

I just wrote a test case yesterday that looks like this:

         # ergh, trial/log interaction kind of sucks
         log.ignoreErrors(BoomErr)
         try:
             doSomethingWhichEventuallyLogErrs()
         finally:
             log.clearIgnores()

I think clearIgnores should be called by the post-test cleanup code in 
trial. In addition, the error that's printed when you FORGET to 
ignoreErrors should make it obvious that it's because trial considers 
log.err() to be an error: It took me a few minutes of profound boggling 
after looking at the traceback, and then the code, which looked like

try:
     foo()
except:
     log.err()
     return None

And the traceback pointing at the line foo() is called on. Which is 
reasonable; that's the traceback log.err() prints. It just needs to be 
more obvious what's going on, and that I should, perhaps, add an 
ignoreErrors call to my test case (or fix a bug).
