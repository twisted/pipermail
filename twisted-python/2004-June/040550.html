Neat. Note that shtoom (shtoom.divmod.org) also has an RTP
implementation in Twisted - if you're planning to release your
code, there may be stuff we can borrow from each other.

One trick I do in shtoom is put in a ConnectedUDP to the other end, then
read the local address off that. It's ugly, but gives me the IP of the
local interface that's being used for this connection. You could also
use STUN for this, of course. But that won't give you _all_ interfaces.

I don't believe that this is possible in a portable way.

&gt;<i> Oh yeah, there seem to be a few bugs in the current wxreactor support, 
</I>&gt;<i> most notably with any custom dialog boxes - the OK/Cancel return doesn't

</I>
Neither wxsupport or wxreactor are suitable for heavy lifting. wxsupport
blocks whenever wx spawns a sub-event-loop (for dialogs, menus, and the
like) and wxreactor can give no better than the wxTimer's granularity.
The wx docs promise &quot;no worse than 1s&quot; granularity. On Linux, it doesn't
seem to be a problem. On Windows, tho, you're boned.

Run the wx mainloop in your main thread, and spawn a second thread to
run the twisted event loop. You then use callFromThread() to pass things
to the twisted event loop, and you can make your own shim to pass stuff
back to the wx event loop. Again, shtoom has this code, in
shtoom/ui/wxui/ (thanks to Andy Hird for writing this).
