</I>&gt;<i>Neat. Note that shtoom (shtoom.divmod.org) also has an RTP
</I>&gt;<i>implementation in Twisted - if you're planning to release your
</I>&gt;<i>code, there may be stuff we can borrow from each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Actually I extensively studied the Shtoom code before I started as it contained many ideas I could use and explained a lot of Twisted subtleties - I must thank you for that, it's well written and extremely easy to learn from.
The RTP code is borrowed from Shtoom with a few changes to make it support other media formats in an independent manner - at the moment I'm multicasting 5 different MP3 streams around the house with it and it works fine.
The system is my undergrad project, however once it's marked I plan to release the code, there's definitely stuff that can borrowed either way.

&gt;&gt;<i> Firstly, Is there any way to determine your own IP address from with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Twisted, I've looked around everywhere and can't find away to achieve 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this except by setting up a loopback connection and reading it from the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transport - but that only gives 127.0.0.1. Is there any way to determine 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all available local IPs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>One trick I do in shtoom is put in a ConnectedUDP to the other end, then
</I>&gt;<i>read the local address off that. It's ugly, but gives me the IP of the
</I>&gt;<i>local interface that's being used for this connection. You could also
</I>&gt;<i>use STUN for this, of course. But that won't give you _all_ interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I don't believe that this is possible in a portable way.
</I>
Yeah, I saw that code in Shtoom, however when I tried it I only got '0.0.0.0' - dunno what was going on there. i think at the moment I'll just stick with gethostbyname(gethostname()) for internal IPs and leave the rest for now - NAT seems like too much pain.

&gt;&gt;<i> Oh yeah, there seem to be a few bugs in the current wxreactor support, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most notably with any custom dialog boxes - the OK/Cancel return doesn't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seem to be processed on time and causes a wxDateTime assertion error, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does it work for anyone else?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Neither wxsupport or wxreactor are suitable for heavy lifting. wxsupport
</I>&gt;<i>blocks whenever wx spawns a sub-event-loop (for dialogs, menus, and the
</I>&gt;<i>like) and wxreactor can give no better than the wxTimer's granularity.
</I>&gt;<i>The wx docs promise &quot;no worse than 1s&quot; granularity. On Linux, it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i>seem to be a problem. On Windows, tho, you're boned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Run the wx mainloop in your main thread, and spawn a second thread to
</I>&gt;<i>run the twisted event loop. You then use callFromThread() to pass things
</I>&gt;<i>to the twisted event loop, and you can make your own shim to pass stuff
</I>&gt;<i>back to the wx event loop. Again, shtoom has this code, in
</I>&gt;<i>shtoom/ui/wxui/ (thanks to Andy Hird for writing this).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Anthony
</I>
wxreactor seems to be ok for most tasks, I have a fairly complex dynamic GUI running here, however the most random actions will just bring it down. I saw the threaded code in Shtoom and guess that&#8217;s the way to go, it just seems a lot of work if wxreactor can be fixed.
