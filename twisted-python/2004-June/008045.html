It sounds like maybe the program you're calling isn't flushing its writes 
to stdout.  If it doesn't, there's no way for Twisted to see its output 
until the program's output buffer overflows.

One quick way to check: are you always getting the messages in blocks of 
roughly N bytes, (except perhaps for the last block before the program 
exits)?  If so, you need to get your coworker to flush his output buffer.

Alternatively, depending on your platform, creating a pty (aka 
pseudoterminal) may be an option.  This would be to convince your 
co-worker's program that it's talking to a console, and therefore should 
output data as it becomes available instead of buffering it.  But that 
depends somewhat on the language/libraries being used by the program.
