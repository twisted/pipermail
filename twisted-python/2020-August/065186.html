</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> qt5reactor isn't particularly active and and my hope in it moving into the Twisted organization is that if all 'active' maintainers are lost and someone else volunteers later, an organizational maintainer could choose to give the new volunteer the necessary authority.  It may well be that this is a silly reason to make the move but I haven't been corrected about it yet.  :]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't originate the 1password suggestion but if a Twisted PyPI account were created, as Adi mentioned, and the credentials stored in 1password then that would associate control with the Twisted organization rather than individual developers.  The presently 'active' individual developers would presumably retain their PyPI maintainership rights as well.
</I>&gt;<i>

I think I probably made the 1password suggestion.  Let me try to clear this up, since I don't think it's a general-purpose thing to do on PyPI.

However, there's an interaction between Travis's bad (i.e. non-existent) secrets management and PyPI's release tokens: <A HREF="https://travis-ci.community/t/travis-encrypt-data-too-large-for-pypi-tokens-with-older-repos/5792">https://travis-ci.community/t/travis-encrypt-data-too-large-for-pypi-tokens-with-older-repos/5792</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://travis-ci.community/t/travis-encrypt-data-too-large-for-pypi-tokens-with-older-repos/5792">https://travis-ci.community/t/travis-encrypt-data-too-large-for-pypi-tokens-with-older-repos/5792</A>&gt; which sometimes necessitates a &quot;release robot&quot; user whose password can be provided to Travis for releases.  (We should be migrating every project to this kind of release, if we can, rather than doing it manually on people's laptops or whatever.)  1password is a good mechanism to share this account among maintainers.

I think that the solution is to use <A HREF="https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish">https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish">https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish</A>&gt; instead, and decrease dependency on Travis, since it seems to be unmaintained since the acquisition.
