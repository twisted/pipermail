<PRE>Hello,

I have finally gotten to a stage where I want to run my very large 
application as a daemonized twisted app, and I have two questions:

1) The program uses multiple UDP/TCP clients and servers that are 
currently launched with reactor.listenTCP / UDP connectTCP/UDP etc. I've 
been using MultiService, according to the twisted documentation.
Some of these services were are at a top level of my app so it was easy 
to turn that part into a .tac file and switch the reacor calls to 
internet.TCPServer etc.
However, some of them are deep inside my code, and are instantiated on 
the fly.

What is the &quot;right&quot; way to attach them to my service parent? (the part 
with &quot;.setServiceParent(&lt;myMultiservice&gt;&quot;)
Should I now add a pointer to my MultiService that will be propagated 
down the  code hierarchy to each of these calls and be accessible at the 
inner scopes?
Is there a neater way to do it just with importing the right modules? 
(in the same way that in usual twisted scripts the loaded reactor is a 
global reactor)

2)  There are still scenarios where I would want to run my code the 
&quot;reactor&quot; way rather than than using the application framework, and I 
would love to be able to keep a single file that's compatible with both 
modes..
Is there a way to detect in runtime whether the code is being run 
through 'twistd' and the app framework or if its run directly?
I was thinking of doing something like:

if &lt;test if we are run as an app&gt;:
    internet.TCPServer(&lt;port&gt;,&lt;factory&gt;).setServiceParent(&lt;myMultiservice&gt;)
else:
    reactor.listenTCP(&lt;port&gt;,&lt;factory&gt;)


Thanks!
Nadav
