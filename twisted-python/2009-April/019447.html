Unfortunately, I don't think many people will have advice beyond: &quot;Do
what feels right.&quot;

Design is an iterative process, you learn from your mistakes.  Try
just writing your game - doing it the &quot;wrong&quot; way first - and then
think more about what makes sense in terms of design, or ask more
specific questions about design later when you've actually implemented
something.

&gt;<i> &#160; There is a lot of good twisted documentation, but that is what also makes
</I>&gt;<i> it difficult because each one does things differently depending on what
</I>&gt;<i> they're implementing and it makes it difficult to decide which is the
</I>&gt;<i> correct approach for what I want to do.&#160; So, if there are any good documents
</I>&gt;<i> related closer to what I'm doing I'd appreciate the heads up on that as
</I>&gt;<i> well.&#160; Well, thanks for your time.
</I>
Try going through the classic finger tutorial and then relating those
concepts to your application:

<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/tutorial/index.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/tutorial/index.html</A>

There is never going to be a document &quot;How to write the very
application you're thinking of now&quot;, but rather always &quot;How to write
some other application&quot; - so you're tasked with realizing an
isomorphism between the concepts.
