Is the dtpPort supposed to accept more than one connection?  I was under the
impression that anywhere one would bind port 0 would be a place that one or
only a few connections would be accepted.

</I>
I am willing to bet that the unwanted effects you saw were tracebacks on the
code we're talking about :)

</I>
You have committed it.  Still: I see no loseConnection being called on a
*Port*, only on a *Server*, which is a connection that got accepted from a
port.

&gt;<i> Are you sure you get a (Port n closed) on the log? Here they are all shown

</I>
That's as a result of seeing connectionLost, loseConnection is never
necessarily called.

&gt;<i> BTW, The point with my last reply was that I can't see that some of the code
</I>&gt;<i> changed are ever run, and that makes it hard to test ;)
</I>
Yes, and my point is that, as far as I understand FTP, you *should* be
exercising that code.  I still don't understand why you're not.
