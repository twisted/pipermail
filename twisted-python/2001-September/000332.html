Yep, that's right; and it should remain so.  It's important to be able to
determine the 'real' position as well as the other positions of an object.

&gt;<i> My proposed solution is to not include the location's containers in the

</I>&gt;<i> behind it.
</I>
I'd say that this is the wrong solution.

&gt;<i> I also think the set of broadcast routines should be standardised, 
</I>&gt;<i> especially at this early stage. That way, there will be some standards for 
</I>&gt;<i> TRDemo and Inheritance as well as any future games. Some broadcast 
</I>&gt;<i> routines just call others.
</I>
Yes.  Those routines have been through more revisions than any other code I've
ever worked on, and mostly before I got exposed to the 'simplest thing'
doctrine of XP, as is probably obvious :).  The single-broadcast proposal you I
responded to in my other email seems like a good solution to that, and it
should not require making any changes to the placement code.

Such a unified 'broadcast' ought to collect all the objects in all the
locations that the object is present in, uniquify that list, and *then* start
broadcasting; I was still starry-eyed from reading too many lisp textbooks and
wanted to do everything recursively before :).  Iteration is better suited to
this problem, I think.

&gt;<i> I do have plans to port the more common IF examples to TR (Golden Skull, 
</I>&gt;<i> Alice In Wonderland) and perhaps the Greedy Gargoyle from PUB :) when I 
</I>&gt;<i> run out of things I wish to do to TR.
</I>
Cool.  Those ports would be nifty :)

&gt;<i> The 'drop' routine for the figure also needs some work. If I drop it when 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have it, I get the message (the self squeaks). If I take it and 
</I>&gt;<i> drop it, I don't get the message. All that is needed is a test to see if 
</I>&gt;<i> the current location is a guest and broadcast the message then. I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> know why there is a call to InappropriateVerb after the message.
</I>
Feel free to fix it.

It raises InappropriateVerb because that means &quot;Keep going and looking for
other verbs called 'drop', then do that.&quot;  &quot;Inappropriate&quot; might be an, erm,
inappropriate word for that. :-)

However, there were plans at one point to replace as many verbs as possible
with 'action' methods, that would be called as pre/post on multiple objects and
somewhat more special-cased as in Inform, and relegate the verb_xxx methods to
parsing.

I still think this is a good idea but don't really have much time to implement
it.

BTW: If you're going to be patching code, I recommend downloading the newest
TRDemo and Inheritance code, as I've modified them to be Twisted Plugins and
modified their README's accordingly.  More documentation forthcoming.
