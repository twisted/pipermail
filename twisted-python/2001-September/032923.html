&gt;<i> I think you have a good criticism there, but we need to have a method which

</I>
Yes.
How about a global configuration file?
The &quot;system&quot; parameters can be in twisted.config, which will be a sane
default for installation, contain just variable assignment, and expected
to be rewritten in any installer?

&gt;<i> , since most platforms are vastly
</I>&gt;<i> different in their management of paths.
</I>
Hence my limitation for &quot;Debian-specific&quot;. 
I note I do not want to put such things in the .diff.gz. Ideally,
I'd like the .diff.gz to be empty.

&gt;<i> Right now, I'm thinking I want to have
</I>&gt;<i> /User/%s/Applications/Twisted.app/Contents/Plugins as my plugin directory...
</I>&gt;<i> ^_^
</I>
Cool ;-)

&gt;<i> &lt;rant&gt; I really hate the unix installation scheme.
</I>
No, what you hate is that UNIX sucks, not the standards. If UNIX could
have a &quot;private view of the filesystem&quot;, there'd be no /home, no dot-files
(just change the /etc/whatever in &quot;your&quot; filesystem) and dead easy package
management.
 
&gt;<i>  The fact that Windows is
</I>&gt;<i> worse isn't an excuse.
</I>
&quot;Windows' biggest crime is that they made UNIX look like a good operating
system. UNIX's biggest crime is that it made Windows look user-friendly&quot;

&gt;<i> Debian does a great job of covering for some really
</I>&gt;<i> basic deficiencies in it, but unless you're on a system with a package manager
</I>&gt;<i> there's no way to tell where a file came from.
</I>
Yep. You should read DJB's stuff.

&gt;<i> I want Twisted to be a self-contained
</I>&gt;<i> directory on all systems by default, and have specific policy settings only on
</I>&gt;<i> those systems where an &quot;installer&quot; or package management system is
</I>&gt;<i> advantageous. &lt;/rant&gt;
</I>
You won't here a peep from me about such policy. Mostly because the only
system I care about falls within your exception ;-)

&gt;<i> I do think Twisted should be integrated into the installation culture wherever
</I>&gt;<i> it goes.  However, /usr/share/twisted/plugins doesn't necessarily make sense
</I>&gt;<i> for system-wide installs even on debian.  (Python's maintainer flaunts policy,
</I>&gt;<i> why shouldn't we? ^_^)  Probably plugins will have to live under site-python,
</I>&gt;<i> in order that appropriate .pyc and .so files may be created (thanks to the
</I>&gt;<i> ever-changing bytecode specification).
</I>
Living under site-python won't help that. Trust me on that -- it will only
make things worse for no good use. (I've sat on the debian-python list
for that information. I had looong discussions with co-developers.)

&gt;<i> The strategy that makes the most sense to me right now is just a
</I>&gt;<i> twisted/python/path.py which has a big if-tree that adds paths depending on 
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> platform you're using.  That seems icky though, so I'm open to better
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions.
</I>
Well, I can assure you that if that happens, debian/rules first job will
be to rewrite twisted/python/path.py into one line ;-)
Which is why I want it to be one line in the first place ;-)
The installer-builder will rewrite it anyway, and the developer won't mind
turning on an environment variable.

Also see the way mailman handles configuration.
