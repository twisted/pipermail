Yeah.  The socket wouldn't get closed (In fact, a traceback would prevent
anything from happening at all...) , and so you'd run out of available
listening sockets (15 tcp.Ports = 15 listening sockets * 5 queue entries = 75
queue entries) fairly quickly.  (See below about NT...)

&gt;<i> Well, there's seems to be two types of behaviour intended with the code, and

</I>&gt;<i> entirely, but there should be a function doing that.
</I>
Both of those behaviors are necessary.  Calling loseConnection on a Port means
&quot;stop accepting connections on this port&quot; (as the documentation reads).  If you
were to not remove that from the select loop, some ugly behavior would result.

&gt;<i> Another thing, the limit for maximum Ports, where is it? And can shouldn't it
</I>&gt;<i> be configurable?
</I>
This is an OS-imposed limit, as far as I know. I can't do anything about it.

&gt;<i> And here follows the somewhat confusing traceback. Note that this is upon
</I>&gt;<i> re-connecting the ftp-server. When the client can't connect to the server,
</I>&gt;<i> there's nothing on the log.
</I>
Can you reproduce this on a UNIX?  Is this an NT or 95 derivative Windows
you're using?

I'll hazard a guess that it's NT &quot;Workstation&quot;, which has some colorfully
imposed limits on the number of sockets you can listen on.  Although I don't
know if 95 has the same issues.  The &quot;red hat linux installation guide&quot; has
step-by-step instructions for fixing that &quot;bug&quot; :-)
