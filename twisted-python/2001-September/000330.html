<PRE>Further progress...

I have changed the Drop routine for the Romero figure. It first tests if 
the location hasIntelligence() before broadcastToPair() the fact it made a 
noise when dropped. Is testing the location for hasIntelligence() the 
standard way of finding out if the location is a guest/player?

I would think that the broadcast routine could be coded as one routine 
with the following parameters:

(self, subject, to_target, to_subject, to_other)

self = reference for the thing where the broadcast originates from

subject = person acting on the thing

to_target = message for thing

to_subject = message for subject

to_other = message for others

I admit I have not sat down and thought about all the different scenarios. 
I'll get to that soon. Hopefully, there will only need to be a few 
broadcast routines (preferably one) which will be suitable for all 
situations.

Glyph, I will provide a diff as soon as we can work out what to do with 
the container problem I mentioned in this thread yesterday.

Cheers,
ChrisH
