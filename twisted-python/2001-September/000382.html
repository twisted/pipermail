<PRE>I understand your concern, but I don't think we can classify it as a &quot;hole&quot;
unless it violates a specified invariant. Before continuing this discussion, we
should identify the security strategy that twistd will pursue.  I believe that
the working directory of a twistd process should uniquely identify that process
and that the process -- maybe this is not a good idea.  The reason that the
particular feature you're talking about was implemented is purely as a
convenience; hopefully in the future there will be some way to scan for Twisted
plugins, and I was thinking that the Python path might not be the right place
to do that search.  A good security strategy may be to &quot;freeze&quot; a server by not
giving it write permissions to that directory, so that it can never reconfigure
itself, but in that case an additional 'persistence' mechanism will probably be
required.

So, what are our invariants?  In what ways should we buttress those invariants
with OS-specified garuantees?  There are probably some other things we need to
look at eliminating, too.
