Subject: [Twisted-Python] INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Adding "parent" as a required
	attribute to IService
Message-ID: <CAOA_4jCStg+NuMheLSgGm5Rr9xULeUfr=eJ4=Ts=vjfBg2Rrww@mail.gmail.com>

IService's docstrings obliquely referred to a "parent" attribute, but have
not actually specified its type or existence. This change makes this
attribute mandatory. It also makes the existence of the other IService
attributes, running and name, enforced by verifyObject.

The ticket is available here: https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7922
and the buildbots are green on the branch (the intermittent thread failure
failed intermittently).

Especially if you defined your own IService implementations that do not
inherit from Service, please run your unittests with this branch.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Python chess game server issue,
	data is not received the blocking of ambigious process in the same
	virtual host.
Message-ID: <tencent_2990F07D3ADEFC536FA172AB@qq.com>

A python process listen on port 4001, and there is clients connected to it and play some chess game. but strangely, One more than two days later, there may be one or two more other process listen on the same port 4001 which block the data which should send to my python server.
I use the "sudo netstat -antup" intented to find the process ID, but that newly created process listening on port 4001 has no pid or pname.
And when I try to kill the initial python server process listening on port 4001 using command kill pid, after exected the kill command, I use netstat -antup again, suprisingly, I found that process which should be killed are still alive.
Then I use command kill -9 pid to kill it, then execute netstat - antup commnd, all the process listening on port 4001 disappeared.

Would u please kindly give me any answer?

I use the TWISTD to start my application. the outline for them is below:
$TWISTD ......
from twisted.application import service, internet
application = service.Application("myserver")
Thanks,
Mark

Unfortunately this is not nearly enough information to diagnose the issue.  What messages do you see in your logs?  When is your process re-started?  If it isn't re-started, how did it lose access to the socket it was already listening on?

This doesn't make sense.  By definition, processes on Linux have PIDs.

> And when I try to kill the initial python server process listening on port 4001 using command kill pid, after exected the kill command, I use netstat -antup again, suprisingly, I found that process which should be killed are still alive.

And this makes even less sense - how can you kill a PID if there is no PID?

I hope we can get to the bottom of this but we will definitely need more information.  As it is I have no idea what is happening, let alone why.

I'm in favor of this change, as it allows for hierarchy-traversal between IService and IServiceCollection that was not previously technically possible with the formal interface.  As Moshe says, the docstrings already imply the existence of this attribute, and the existing implementation already has it.  Other non-inheriting IService implementations have it too, at least from what I have heard on IRC so far.

I haven't heard anything on IRC, but maybe you're thinking of Tristan's
e-mail here:
https://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2015-May/029521.html
where he said they did, indeed, have a parent.

Oh, I spoke too soon.  All the ENOMEMs are coming out of os.fork, which I guess means somehow process spawning got disabled?  I am wondering if the buildslave has lingering subprocesses hanging out and blowing its cgroup quota inside its docker container (these are running inside docker, right?)

ENOMEM on fork() can just mean that overcommit is disabled and there is
insufficient virtual memory available to temporarily accomodate 2x the
process's memory size, even though there is enough memory available to
accomodate 1x.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] pypy support
Message-ID: <530CB108-03D0-41BA-A3EF-B30AB3D773C8@twistedmatrix.com>

Many Twisted core developers (myself included) like to suggest that we run PyPy.  We ourselves run PyPy in production.  It kinda works.

And yet, our test suite is still failing on PyPy after many years.

I'd like to suggest that if you have some time to write some code for Twisted this month, you fix a test failure or two on <https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/debian7-pypy2.5/builds/44/steps/trial/logs/problems <https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/debian7-pypy2.5/builds/44/steps/trial/logs/problems>>.  Some of these are subtle and weird, but there really aren't that many of them (14 failures, 16 errors in all).

Once we can move the builder to supported (which HawkOwl has done with two other builders this month!) we will have a lot more assurance that PyPy will keep working in all those production environments :).

Many of them appear to be just the fact that PyPy dicts retain order and 
seem like a great way to get started with contributing to Twisted.

On behalf of the Software Freedom Conservancy and the Twisted project 
I'm happy to announce that we're looking for a paid maintainer for the 
Twisted project.

Funding a software developer to work as a maintainer will help Twisted 
grow as a project, and enable Twisted's development community to 
increase their output of innovative code for the public's benefit. 
Twisted has strict coding, testing, documentation, and review standards, 
which ensures excellent code quality, continually improving 
documentation and code test coverage, and minimal regressions. Code 
reviews are historically a bottleneck for getting new code merged. A 
funded maintainer will help alleviate this bottleneck, and speed 
Twisted's development.

Message-ID: <9B343C10-E611-4FB9-B70D-7BBE3BDC3CC8@atleastfornow.net>

Hi everyone,

As mentioned in http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2015-March/029258.html , Twisted is removing Python 2.6 support. As such, I would like to announce that 15.3 will be the last release with 2.6 support. After this release, the Python 2.6 buildbots will be removed from the 'supported' list and most likely retired.

This will remove all buildbot coverage of OS X and RHEL/CentOS. As I've been taking point on the buildbots recently, I'm going to be deploying a new CentOS 7 buildslave which will provide coverage of that platform. That just leaves OS X uncovered -- so if you would like to donate buildslaves for this, please send me an email.

I don't think that we covered terrible well why we are dropping support.  So I'm going to give my take on this, and if 

We want Twisted to be available in all kinds of environments.  Since it's Twisted's job to let your program talk to the outside world, it's pretty important for you to be able to upgrade it wherever.  Heck, we still support Windows XP!  Plus, while occasionally annoying, Python 2.6 doesn't impose a significant maintenance burden.  So superficially it would seem that we would totally support Python 2.6.

However, Python 2.6 is unsupported by the upstream Python maintainers, and given the increasingly hostile threat landscape, inconveniencing ourselves even a little bit to provide the false impression that Python 2.6 is a "supported" environment where doing new development is OK is not worthwhile.

"But glyph", I hear my hypothetical interlocutor say, "didn't you just say Windows XP isn't supported?  surely that's more of a security risk than python 2.6!" 

It's true that Windows XP is a worse security risk, but the difference between XP and 2.6 is that we support Windows XP may bean immutable fact of access to some hardware.  According to <http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey <http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey>>, roughly 3% of gamers still use Windows XP, and there's no way for someone writing a Steam game to deliver an OS upgrade along with it, because they don't have access to that environment.  The best we can do there is hope that those people eventually buy new computers.

However, if you're delivering software into a Python 2.6 environment, unless it's an embedded environment without support for 2.7, it is at least to some degree under the "your" control (by "your" I mean the software author, which may be an organization where a particular individual who wants to use Twisted doesn't have a say).  The only such environment I am aware of is Sublime Text 2, which unfortunately did not upgrade to Python 2.7, but Sublime Text 3, which supports Python 3.3, has been out for over 2 years now.

That said, discontinuing Python 2.6 support in this way - simply removing the buildbots and letting people using it on 2.6 eventually start getting syntax errors when they try to import some random module doesn't help to communicate this intent very well.

To that end, I'd like to propose that we follow suit with the Cryptography project, and emit a DeprecationWarning in 15.3.  When you 'pip install cryptography' into a 2.6 environment today, it says:

.../site-packages/cryptography/__init__.py:25: DeprecationWarning: Python 2.6 is no longer supported by the Python core team, please upgrade your Python.

We could say something similar, adding something like "16.0 will not support python 2.6 and may not work at all in your application".

I don't think it would be worthwhile to do this in every possible unsupported / de-supported environment, but this affects a particularly large audience, many of whom may be ignorant of the issues at stake.  <https://caremad.io/2015/04/a-year-of-pypi-downloads/ <https://caremad.io/2015/04/a-year-of-pypi-downloads/>> indicates that roughly 10% of Python users are still stuck on some version of Python 2.6; hopefully Cryptography will be exerting some subtle pressure to get those numbers down.

Hm... It's like my mail client decided to do an "Undo" right before sending.

This should say:

"I don't think we covered terribly well why we are dropping support.  So I'm going to give my take on this, and if Hawkie's differs, hopefully she can expand on that."

Hi JP,

I know that this would leave OS X uncovered -- lukasa, habnabit, and Adi have at separate points offered OS X builders of varying OS levels and even Python versions, both on the mailing list and in #twisted-dev (where Lukasa answered the call from this email and offered a Yosemite builder today), which is why I am confident that this will not end up being an issue when 15.3's first prerelease is issued.

I think the prevailing reason that we don't have an OS X 2.7 bot is that last time OS X hardware was offered, the buildbot was not being actively maintained. I've taken up the mantle in some capacity and getting Twisted supported on more platforms is my primary goal. And as an OS X user, I have some vested interest in it continuing being supported.

I think JP's point is that instead of saying "the OS X builder is going away, and if someone steps up there will be another one" we should say "we will make alternate plans for OS X before shutting off 2.6 support".  I'm inclined to agree; if it's not going to be hard to do the upgrade anyway, we should make it a precondition.

This prompted me to see if the existing builder could be upgraded.  I thought the hardware was unsupported, but I hadn't checked.  I think I was wrong, and it is now downloading Yosemite.  (For the third time.  Trying to do this download on the first day of WWDC may not have been the greatest idea.)

I think that new hardware would still be preferable because this machine is old, slow, overtaxed, and unreliable.  For example, it runs Speed Center as well as the OS X builder.  We have redundancy in most of our other builders now, which is very useful especially during times of heavy activity, like sprints, where lots of concurrent builds are going on, but this is the sole OS X builder.

Another area where redundancy would be nice is when doing upgrades.  For example, if the download ever finishes, I'm going to pull the trigger on this Yosemite upgrade, and ... hopefully it works?  If it doesn't, we will have zero Mac builders until someone in the data center that is donating hosting can plug a console into that machine and see why it didn't finish booting.  There's not really a good way to manage this right now.

Finally, it would be nice to actually support multiple pythons on multiple OS versions - all the still supported / updated ones, anyway - and we'd need multiple builders for that.

15.3 is the last release *with* Python 2.6 support -- that is, the 2.6 builders will be on the supported list until at least 15.3 is released. The goal is that we have both 2.6 and 2.7 on OS X tested before 15.3's release.

>

I would much prefer to have a new builder to take up the role, migrate the buildslave roles, and then upgrade the existing 10.6 slave once we have something new working. That way, if something goes wrong during the upgrade, we maintain a supported OS X builder.

-----

I think I've been failing at communication a bit -- a prerequisite of dropping 2.6 support has always hinged on getting 2.7 (and optionally 3.3/3.4) builders for platforms that only had 2.6. I have a RHEL7 builder in the wings to get that platform supported, Debian has 7 & 8 now supported, and there's OS X, which I am confident I can get 2.7 builders set up for before 15.3.

I agree with all of this with one minor caveat - there are currently two 
OS X slaves:

  http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/buildslaves/bot-exarkun-1
  http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/buildslaves/osuosl-osx10.6

(and incidentally if someone wants to rename the former I think that'd 
be nice).

Heh, good to know!  Is it possible to remotely administer the latter?

Hi John,

Glyph's discussing the other Mac Mini hosted by the Oregon State University Open Source Lab -- the EGH one is the one we upgraded tonight to 10.10 and is now our first supported 10.10-py27 builder (http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/osx10.10-py2.7/builds/6). So everything's all good with that :)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Unsupported buildbots and future supported
	platforms
Message-ID: <08145D75-792F-4658-9D6B-1BF2353BE6FB@atleastfornow.net>

Glyph and I have been discussing the state of "unsupported" buildbots for the Twisted project, and some of the cleanup of unsupported platforms that I've been doing. To get the reasons for this, and an idea of the future out, Glyph suggested I post to the mailing list.

In the past, a lot of the unsupported buildbots were platforms that we knew didn't work. A lot of these have been tested for many months, kept in the unsupported list, and not had much progress. We need to focus on the unsupported builders that have a path to being supported, and get them onto the supported list.

I've now removed broken, absent, or superseded builders, giving us five unsupported builders. These are:

- FreeBSD 10.1, Python 3.4 -- Tests almost pass, waiting on https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7887 to make it all-green. Once it is green, it can move to supported.
- OS X 10.6, Python 2.6, cfreactor -- There are only a few failing tests -- soon, there'll be a OS X 10.10 cfreactor builder (once we get XCode installed on it :) )
- Python 3K Warnings -- Two failures, which are warnings counting -- should be trivial.
- Ubuntu Trusty, Python 2.7, wxreactor -- broken, needs fixing
- Ubuntu Trusty, PyPy 2.4. -- 32 failing tests http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/trusty64-pypy-2.4/builds/132/steps/trial/logs/problems . Some are pypy, some are configuration related.

These builders should ideally move into the 'supported' list in the future. To do this, we need to:

- Get https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7887 reviewed to get the FreeBSD 10.1 + Python 3.4 builder as a supported platform
- Fix https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7931 to make the Python 3K Warnings builder pass
- Get a new OS X 10.10 cfreactor builder, to see what failures there are on Python 2.7
- Redeploy the wxreactor builder, see what failures there are. I'm planning to do this on a newly deployed Ubuntu 15.04 machine when I get time.
- File more tickets in https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query?group=status&milestone=PyPy-support for the failures on the PyPy builder and fix them. I'm planning on also doing a PyPy 2.6 builder using the aforementioned Ubuntu 15.04 buildbot, using the PPA, which should shake out the new dict-sorting bugs.

If you would like to see these builders become supported in the future, please do consider helping out! :)

Hi everyone,

Just so you know, Twisted has had two more builders added to the supported list. These are:

- FreeBSD 10.1 with Python 2.7
- Apple OS X 10.10 Yosemite with Python 2.7

Many thanks to Tavendo for the FreeBSD builder and Glyph for updating one of our OS X 10.6 builders to 10.10 so that I could get Python 2.7 builds running on it.

Dear list,

I've tried running Twisted 15.2.1 with my old library, and I am
getting an exception, that I haven't seen before (with Twisted
14.0.0):

      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/txthings/coap.py",
line 1338, in sendResponse
        print "Token: %s" % (response.token)
      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/twisted/logger/_io.py",
line 163, in write
        string = string.decode(self._encoding)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/encodings/utf_8.py", line 16, in decode
        return codecs.utf_8_decode(input, errors, True)
    exceptions.UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xae
in position 7: invalid start byte

Although it is triggered by simple print, it seems to be caused by
logging. Does new logging framework need any configuration to stay
compatible with the old one?

Best regards
Maciej Wasilak

If there were a problem I definitely would have sent a direct email - thank you for keeping an eye on the mailing list though, it's great to know people are paying attention :).

Thanks for writing up the plan like this, Amber.  It sounds like a lot of these plans are really quite far along and we might not have any unsupported builders soon, which would be quite an accomplishment.

Although logger is reacting to this in a bad way, and that is a bug, your program has a bug too: you are printing to a text file (which is what stdout is when it is redirected to a log) by using binary data.  python 3 will mangle your output if you try to do this, so you should restrict your program to unicode if you intend to redirect stdout to a logger.

Here's a very simple example which provokes the same bad behavior:

import sys
from twisted.logger import globalLogBeginner, textFileLogObserver
globalLogBeginner.beginLoggingTo([textFileLogObserver(sys.stdout)])
print(b"Testing testing, one \xae two.")

The equivalent in old-style logging would be:

import sys
from twisted.python.log import startLogging
startLogging(sys.stdout)
print(b"Testing testing, one \xae two.")

Therefore this is a regression in the new logging system.  I've filed it as a bug, here: <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7933 <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7933>>.  In the future, I would encourage you to take advantage of the pre-release testing period to discover issues like this, since it would have been nice to know about this before the final release went out ;-).  (Not to say this is your fault though, this is totally our bug, and I'm surprised we didn't catch it given all the other similar stuff we caught before the release.)

Thank you for your help. I'll update my library, and replace all
occurences of print with log.msg("").

I've found the problem only after installing PyPI package with
'twisted>=14.0.0' dependency on new system. Sorry!

No need to apologize!  There's an implied question here, which is: is there any way we can make the prerelease process work better for you?  Some channel where we could communicate it where you'd notice?  Some way to fit it into your workflow?

I've seen this announcement coming every year or so, and as your link 
above said:

I never saw here, or anywhere else AFAIK, besides Tom Prince write ups 
when he got hired, reports of the progress made through this fellow ship.
Did I miss anything or is there another public place than this mailing 
list where I could find the previous fellow ship reports?

Thanks!

We haven't had anyone do this for a while, and in fact unless I'm
misremembering Tom was the last person to do it. So not sure there's
much to look at besides what Tom wrote.

How can I set up Emacs so it gives me inline warnings of Twisted coding
standard violations?

I use flycheck <http://www.flycheck.org/> in Emacs for most projects, and
rely a lot on it. How can I configure it to use twistedchecker
<https://github.com/twisted/twistedchecker> for syntax checks for Twisted
instead of its default flake8 & pylint checkers?

If you sort this out nicely, please share :).  One problem I've had with setting up automatic flymake checking in Twisted is that I cannot figure out how to get it to show me deltas from trunk.  Branches with gigantic unrelated cleanups in them are hard to review, and I don't want my editor yelling at me about changes that aren't in my additions or changes.  (Except when I'm working on a branch whose _goal_ is cleanups, in which case I do).

However, buildbot does this somehow, so it must be possible :).

If I were to try to solve that particular problem, here's what I'd do:

   - add a thing to the checker to allow you to provide a file of known,
   suppressed warnings; the checker would also warn if expected warnings
   weren't there
   - add a Python unit test that fails if there are warnings issued that
   aren't known, or "known" warnings that have gone away
   - kill the dedicated twistedchecker builder
   - whenever I fix up warnings, also modify that file
   - any lint warnings that I wished to legitimately suppress (not just to
   enable incremental migration) I'd disable with comments in the file

Before I did that, I'd make sure the version of twistedchecker was pinned,
because new versions are likely to add/remove warnings. I'd also probably
have a round of massively relaxing twistedchecker's rules.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Should the CFFI wrapper and functions for win32 be
	a separate project?
Message-ID: <CAEgpGv5hA-WwshVRK=hn0x=Y3W=nSh6W1OX+55cnWe7J39W2og@mail.gmail.com>

As the subject says, could the CFFI wrappers around the win32 functions
that Twisted needs be a separate project? This came up briefly in
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7889 so I thought I might pose the
question to a larger audience.

Generally speaking, the idea of making it a separate project to me seems
like a logical step in many ways.  Since the code is not specific to
Twisted keeping it outside of the Twisted project, much like pywin32 is,
makes it easier for contributors and consumers alike to reuse or expand on
the cffi wrapper in the future.  I don't think the objective would be to
replace all of pywin32 initially but to provide enough to be usable by the
Twisted project.

Besides Twisted I know there are some other projects out there that could
benefit from making this a separate project.  But before taking this
approach however I'm wondering if this would be reasonable from Twisted's
perspective?

I think this would be great.

More generally, now that we have support for setuptools extras, I think we might want to consider moving _all_ C/CFFI/Pyrex code outside of Twisted, and making them optional dependencies.  In principle, you should be able to use Twisted without a C compiler, it's just that setuptools has no good way to express that.  But it does have (via extras) a way to express optional dependencies, and if we distributed all the native bindings and speedups as separate packages, we could ultimately fix <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3586 <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3586>> this way.

I think a separate Windows CFFI project is definitely the way to go.
Allows you to focus on the core interfaces required by Twisted and let's
others focus on their own specific areas of interest without duplicating
effort.
I know we'd make use of CFFI into the Windows Crypto modules, for example.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Proposal -- Code of Conduct
Message-ID: <CAOA_4jBv3vv=pYcte7gQ6E8YjKzfBe+1HsPazYak4G=wJtxSgw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I am sure everyone understands that the Twisted community would love more
diversity. While it is hard to achieve, it should be easy to remove one of
the obvious blockers -- making underrepresented groups feel more welcome.

I think, and hope, that our IRC channel, our issue system and mailing list
have been a friendly, pleasant place. This is an attempt to clarify what we
mean by a "friendly, pleasant place".

After some discussion on IRC, I volunteered to write up a Code of Conduct
for Twisted. It is mostly an adaptation of Django's CoC -- I think Django
has a nice track record of commitment to diversity, and, of course, we
expect our communities to overlap.

My current draft, including instructions on how to build it, is in
https://github.com/moshez/twisted-coc . I have intentionally not made the
built documents available, in an attempt to avoid someone picking them up
before they're approved by us.

Please respond if there are any concerns about the wording, anything that I
missed and anything you think does not belong there. I hope we can achieve
consensus, and have the Project Leadership Committee approve this
(including approving the current committee -- I've volunteered to chair it,
and Glyph and Amber (HawkOwl) have graciously agreed to be on it.)

Thanks,
Moshe Z.

The one thing I'm wondering here is why we have our own CoC.  Particularly...

> My current draft, including instructions on how to build it, is in https://github.com/moshez/twisted-coc <https://github.com/moshez/twisted-coc> . I have intentionally not made the built documents available, in an attempt to avoid someone picking them up before they're approved by us. 

Why isn't this repository either (A) just a simple text file saying "we have adopted the Django CoC" or (B) a very small fork of something else?  One of the concerns is licensing; if the text comes via Django, Django credits the "Speak Up!" project, which is CC-BY, apparently from this repository: <https://github.com/jnoller/talk-mentorship>.  Another is... is Twisted really distinct enough to need its own CoC?  Just s/Django/Twisted might be good enough?  (Since this is not a fork, figuring out if anything else has changed is rather tedious, even after having read both ;)).

Thanks again,

I wonder whether it might make sense to just say we adopt https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/ <https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/> ?

What I would really love is if we could have our own diversity statement like Django has: https://www.djangoproject.com/diversity/ <https://www.djangoproject.com/diversity/>

The Django one is more explicit -- it's rather sad that it needs to be, but it does lay out more directly the unacceptable behaviours.

That being said, it's not an unchangeable document -- if it doesn't suit the community's needs, we can modify it to suit.

So that CoCs are just a set of rules to ban users expressed in a vague
legal form, so that people can not complain, because they don't
understand. Is that right? =)

Some repilies to all the issues mentioned here:

1. I think we should definitely maintain our own copy. Sorry for it not
being a fork, the only non-formatting changes I made are things that
referrred to the Django-run events (since we don't run events -- I did
replace some of this language with mention of the meetup group). As for
CC-BY: I did refer to the Django CoC, I thought CC-BY only refers to the
"last point of copying". If it makes sense to add Speak Up! to the mention
for license compliance, I'm happy to do that.

2. The Django CoC specifically has a change procedure. I did not copy that
part over, since our organization is a lot less formal -- I'm pretty sure
it's "if the PLC agrees". I think it's a problem that we don't have the
names of the people on the PLC on our wiki, but this is a separate issue.
[It should be rectified, as well as clarifying the rules for how the PLC
acquires/retires members.

3. I considered briefly the PSF one. I think it is *way* under-specified. I
want to have something that's clear. I think Django, specifically, has a
pretty good track record of promoting diversity and the PSF has a...worse
one.

4. A CoC has several purposes, and "banning people" is actually pretty far
down the list. The first reason is that we assume most people are good
people, or at least wish to follow the rules, and having clear rules about
what's not acceptable will hopefully lead to people voluntarily complying.
The second reason is to send out a message to underrepresented groups: "we
value you, and will protect your right to be treated with dignity in our
community". While this does not solve diversity problems by itself, it is
an important step. A distant third, in my opinion, is the banning of people
-- not least because this issue has not really come up [some people got
banned from IRC, I believe, but usually not for the kind of reasons
described in the CoC, and I don't remember people getting banned from Trac
or the ML]. I really did mean what I said in my first e-mail: we do try to
be an open and inclusive place. We are *already* complying with the CoC.
[If you subscribe to a Hyackean view of law and legislation, this is law,
not legislation.]

5. Not a reply to an e-mail, but I like to publicly call out Hyneck for
actually reading through the CoC, noticing a couple of mistakes and sending
me a pull-request. It is much appreciated!

Thanks everyone who took the time to read and think about this important
issue,
Moshe Z.

Hi everyone,

I am sure everyone understands that the Twisted community would love more
diversity. While it is hard to achieve, it should be easy to remove one of
the obvious blockers -- making underrepresented groups feel more welcome.

I think, and hope, that our IRC channel, our issue system and mailing list
have been a friendly, pleasant place. This is an attempt to clarify what we
mean by a "friendly, pleasant place".

After some discussion on IRC, I volunteered to write up a Code of Conduct
for Twisted. It is mostly an adaptation of Django's CoC -- I think Django
has a nice track record of commitment to diversity, and, of course, we
expect our communities to overlap.

My current draft, including instructions on how to build it, is in
https://github.com/moshez/twisted-coc . I have intentionally not made the
built documents available, in an attempt to avoid someone picking them up
before they're approved by us.

Please respond if there are any concerns about the wording, anything that I
missed and anything you think does not belong there. I hope we can achieve
consensus, and have the Project Leadership Committee approve this
(including approving the current committee -- I've volunteered to chair it,
and Glyph and Amber (HawkOwl) have graciously agreed to be on it.)

Thanks,
Moshe Z.


I've noticed several typos in the Reporting Guidelines section 
(reporting.rst)

I hope this is the appropriate place to report them.

* first sentence of the 4th paragraph of the "What Happens..." section.
  The last word is "response", should be "respond"

* Last sentence of the same paragraph: "Finally, the Working Group will 
make a report on the situation to the DSF board. The board may choose to 
a public report of the incident."  Should be TSF board, not DSF board, and
needs a verb in the final clause, probably "make".

Also, more substantively, the first possible response is "Nothing (if we
determine no violation occurred)."  Maybe I'm just too literal, but I
think there should be a positive response to every report, even if that
response is "We've decided not to do anything", so the reporter knows the
report has been seen and thought about and hasn't just fallen through the
cracks.

Another note, someone earlier implied that since Twisted doesn't sponsor
events, the event-related parts of the Django CoC were irrelevant.  In
the past, there have been several local bug-fixing sprints, one of which
I almost actually attended.  I would think these would qualify as events
and the issues for a CoC when people meet in person may be somewhat
different from when we meet online.


Otherwise, I strongly support this and am happy the Twisted Project is
taking a proactive stance on it.  Great work, everyone, and thank you
Moshe, Glyph and Amber!

Message-ID: <CAP91sFXDYgihevXXvuDpVVBUp43KT=FYT31XnsmSJ8aTKYWQtQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

My controller code first updates DB and then sends out 201 status code
indicating it is done updating in DB.
Issue is somebody waiting to fetch this update from DB will not work
immediately because DB update takes some time(approximately 0.5 second) to
come into effect.

Is there a way I can control/defer sending out 201?
Any sample code/link will be appreciated.

Regards
Vikas

Not that I'm a heavy contributor, but:

   - A CoC is like a ToS in many ways.  They rarely get read until there's
   a problem.
   - A CoC is like a License in many ways.  They should be pretty standard
   infrastructure.

I think both of these facts argue for joining Twisted to an existing CoC.
No one goes around reading the CoC for every group they participate in. We
increase the odds that someone reads our CoC if they get leverage (one
read, lots of groups) and we get spill-over (they read the CoC for another
group and thus know ours).

If an extremely common library (think JSON handler) lacks a feature, we
don't start by creating yet another fork.  We make the case to fix
upstream. We only consider forking if we can't get upstream fixed. A CoC is
no different. In fact, a CoC is likely even more generic than a JSON
library -- I have to wonder what's so special about a CoC that we'd need a
fork!  If we use the upstream CoC, we also benefit from improvements
contributed by others.

I agree with Clayton's points. Please pick a code of conduct that others
have used. Avoid the desire to specialize.

I like the PSF code of conduct, http://bit.ly/psf-coc but any well regarded
CoC will do.

I'm going to come out strongly against using the PSF CoC. It is woefully
inadequate, it includes no mechanisms for reporting, and as any PSF member
who has been on certain mailing lists knows it is actually completely
unenforceable.

Enforcing CoCs is hard, and to that end I don't think adding a section
to the PSF CoC indicating who will act as arbiter for enforcement and
what the stages of remediation available to the arbiters are.

With all due respect ;), that is not a well-formed sentence ...
this part of it:

"adding a section
to the PSF CoC indicating who will act as arbiter for enforcement and
what the stages of remediation available to the arbiters are"

is a noun phrase.  So you said "I don't think [noun phrase]."
I suspect you want to say "I don't think [noun phrase] would be
difficult." ... or something like that.

While it should not in theory be difficult to update the PSF CoC, in
practice I expect it would be quite difficult for the simple reason that:

"This document was approved by the membership of the Python Software
Foundation during the vote which concluded on 19 April 2013."

Implying that any updates to the CoC would also need to be approved by a
vote of the membership.

So while it'd be nice for the PSF CoC to be updated such that it was
enforceable I think that should block adoption of a CoC by the Twisted
Project.

I'm a +1 on adopting the Django CoC.

I'm not picky which CoC we use, but the fact that upstream requires
approval shouldn't disqualify PSF. Part of my argument is that our
contributions benefit a larger community. If PSF needs an enforcement
clause, they might be more than willing to adopt the change -- and a bigger
community would certainly benefit.

The goal should be to participate in and contribute to something broad.
PSF woudl be great.  A little Googling identified some other referenced
CoCs (Twitter, Ubuntu, GDC, OSI, Gnome, Mozilla) -- see
https://openhatch.org/wiki/Project_codes_of_conduct for these and more
examples -- as well as the "Contributor Covenant" that claims ~30 projects
as participants and accepts PRs:

http://contributor-covenant.org/


It seems likely that at least one of these options provides both a good
starting point and an acceptable governance policy.

Can you supply an <http://sscce.org <http://sscce.org/>> that demonstrates your problem?  There are definitely solutions but it sort of depends on exactly how you want this to work.  Also, what database are you using?

I hope that you meant

>> I don't think that should block adoption?


unless you meant you thought it should block adoption of the PSF CoC?

In any case, to try to cover some concerns raised so far:

>> Why the Django CoC rather than the PSF (or, the quite-similar Contributor Covenant)?


There are two reasons: specificity, and reporting.

Specificity is important because of course, everyone wants to be reasonable.  The point of having a code of conduct is outlining what "reasonable" means in our specific context.  Given the difficulties the software industry has had in the last couple of decades with respecting its marginalized members, it's important to take that context into account and say what (sadly) might not be obvious to people.

Clarity around how reporting violations works is important because people who are already feeling harassed in their day-to-day existence are often not going to be comfortable poking around trying to figure out how to deal with a violation of the code on their own.  Most likely, they will simply quietly exit the community.  So it should be as easy as possible to report.

>> Why isn't this a fork of an existing CoC?

I agree that this is a problem.  Django does not appear to have their CoC in an easily-forkable format.  Perhaps we should contact the Django project and ask them to rectify that so that we can make minor tweaks.  We also do need minor tweaks, because the information about contact points for reporting has to be different for different projects.

I'd also like to raise two issues of my own.  In his original message, Moshe said this:

> I think, and hope, that our IRC channel, our issue system and mailing list have been a friendly, pleasant place.

For the most part, I believe this is true, and I think we have managed to be a welcoming and pleasant environment for all concerned.  However, I don't want anyone to get a false sense of confidence from this, and think that we're doing great since we've never had any incidents.  The nature of such incidents is to remain private.  In Twisted's decade-plus of history, especially on IRC, I have had to personally adjudicate several disputes, and we have definitely had potential contributors quietly disappear from the community due to apparent hostility or inappropriate remarks.  We have certainly had to ban people from the channel, on at least one occasion permanently.  There have not been any particularly severe, particularly public or particularly recent incidents, but there has definitely been some unpleasantness at times. So, while I do believe we are doing well, there is unquestionably room to improve.

Thank you all so very much for not making me type that as a reply to anyone saying we don't need a CoC ;-).

Also, I would like to stress that I personally believe that this is a 1.0-release type of effort, and in no way a finished product.  I have lots of concerns with fairness and transparency in the way disputes are handled, and the list of possible responses, but what we have right now (i.e.: the personal judgement of whatever committer happens to be online at the time) is definitely far worse.  So I expect that the work will continue and we will see revisions to this, hopefully in collaboration with other projects so that Twisted developers aren't taking this on, Django being the obvious example.

Russ has informed me that it's accessible on https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/blob/master/djangoproject/templates/conduct/index.html -- so we could potentially fork the repo and make it just that file or so :)

Thanks for the location - but I figured there was a file somewhere in version control :).  It would still be great if Django could split this out into a separate project so we could contribute changes back as well.

I'm generally +1 on the idea of having a CoC.

I'm content to delegate the details to subcommittee, so maybe I should
leave it at that, but I find there's one point I want to reinforce here:

Agreed. Clayton said "They rarely get read until there's a problem," but
I think prevention and expectation-setting are things to aim for here.
If people only find out about what's acceptable conduct *after* there's
a problem, that's too late.

Agreed. (I am one of the current PLC members.)

Hi everyone,

I'm sorry I haven't responded to the e-mails -- I have had a busy weekend,
and my stack was a bit deep for personal projects. I will try to get caught
up and see what the right next step is on Monday.

Thanks for your understanding,
Moshe Z.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: Adding "parent" as a required
	attribute to IService
Message-ID: <CAOA_4jCStg+NuMheLSgGm5Rr9xULeUfr=eJ4=Ts=vjfBg2Rrww@mail.gmail.com>

IService's docstrings obliquely referred to a "parent" attribute, but have
not actually specified its type or existence. This change makes this
attribute mandatory. It also makes the existence of the other IService
attributes, running and name, enforced by verifyObject.

The ticket is available here: https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7922
and the buildbots are green on the branch (the intermittent thread failure
failed intermittently).

Especially if you defined your own IService implementations that do not
inherit from Service, please run your unittests with this branch.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Python chess game server issue,
	data is not received the blocking of ambigious process in the same

Message-ID: <tencent_2990F07D3ADEFC536FA172AB@qq.com>

A python process listen on port 4001, and there is clients connected to it and play some chess game. but strangely, One more than two days later, there may be one or two more other process listen on the same port 4001 which block the data which should send to my python server.
I use the "sudo netstat -antup" intented to find the process ID, but that newly created process listening on port 4001 has no pid or pname.
And when I try to kill the initial python server process listening on port 4001 using command kill pid, after exected the kill command, I use netstat -antup again, suprisingly, I found that process which should be killed are still alive.
Then I use command kill -9 pid to kill it, then execute netstat - antup commnd, all the process listening on port 4001 disappeared.

Would u please kindly give me any answer?

I use the TWISTD to start my application. the outline for them is below:
$TWISTD ......
from twisted.application import service, internet
application = service.Application("myserver")
Thanks,
Mark

Unfortunately this is not nearly enough information to diagnose the issue.  What messages do you see in your logs?  When is your process re-started?  If it isn't re-started, how did it lose access to the socket it was already listening on?

This doesn't make sense.  By definition, processes on Linux have PIDs.

> And when I try to kill the initial python server process listening on port 4001 using command kill pid, after exected the kill command, I use netstat -antup again, suprisingly, I found that process which should be killed are still alive.

And this makes even less sense - how can you kill a PID if there is no PID?

I hope we can get to the bottom of this but we will definitely need more information.  As it is I have no idea what is happening, let alone why.

I'm in favor of this change, as it allows for hierarchy-traversal between IService and IServiceCollection that was not previously technically possible with the formal interface.  As Moshe says, the docstrings already imply the existence of this attribute, and the existing implementation already has it.  Other non-inheriting IService implementations have it too, at least from what I have heard on IRC so far.

I haven't heard anything on IRC, but maybe you're thinking of Tristan's
e-mail here:
https://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2015-May/029521.html
where he said they did, indeed, have a parent.

Oh, I spoke too soon.  All the ENOMEMs are coming out of os.fork, which I guess means somehow process spawning got disabled?  I am wondering if the buildslave has lingering subprocesses hanging out and blowing its cgroup quota inside its docker container (these are running inside docker, right?)

ENOMEM on fork() can just mean that overcommit is disabled and there is
insufficient virtual memory available to temporarily accomodate 2x the
process's memory size, even though there is enough memory available to
accomodate 1x.

Message-ID: <530CB108-03D0-41BA-A3EF-B30AB3D773C8@twistedmatrix.com>

Many Twisted core developers (myself included) like to suggest that we run PyPy.  We ourselves run PyPy in production.  It kinda works.

And yet, our test suite is still failing on PyPy after many years.

I'd like to suggest that if you have some time to write some code for Twisted this month, you fix a test failure or two on <https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/debian7-pypy2.5/builds/44/steps/trial/logs/problems <https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/debian7-pypy2.5/builds/44/steps/trial/logs/problems>>.  Some of these are subtle and weird, but there really aren't that many of them (14 failures, 16 errors in all).

Once we can move the builder to supported (which HawkOwl has done with two other builders this month!) we will have a lot more assurance that PyPy will keep working in all those production environments :).

Many of them appear to be just the fact that PyPy dicts retain order and 
seem like a great way to get started with contributing to Twisted.

On behalf of the Software Freedom Conservancy and the Twisted project 
I'm happy to announce that we're looking for a paid maintainer for the 
Twisted project.

Funding a software developer to work as a maintainer will help Twisted 
grow as a project, and enable Twisted's development community to 
increase their output of innovative code for the public's benefit. 
Twisted has strict coding, testing, documentation, and review standards, 
which ensures excellent code quality, continually improving 
documentation and code test coverage, and minimal regressions. Code 
reviews are historically a bottleneck for getting new code merged. A 
funded maintainer will help alleviate this bottleneck, and speed 
Twisted's development.

Message-ID: <9B343C10-E611-4FB9-B70D-7BBE3BDC3CC8@atleastfornow.net>

Hi everyone,

As mentioned in http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2015-March/029258.html , Twisted is removing Python 2.6 support. As such, I would like to announce that 15.3 will be the last release with 2.6 support. After this release, the Python 2.6 buildbots will be removed from the 'supported' list and most likely retired.

This will remove all buildbot coverage of OS X and RHEL/CentOS. As I've been taking point on the buildbots recently, I'm going to be deploying a new CentOS 7 buildslave which will provide coverage of that platform. That just leaves OS X uncovered -- so if you would like to donate buildslaves for this, please send me an email.

I don't think that we covered terrible well why we are dropping support.  So I'm going to give my take on this, and if 

We want Twisted to be available in all kinds of environments.  Since it's Twisted's job to let your program talk to the outside world, it's pretty important for you to be able to upgrade it wherever.  Heck, we still support Windows XP!  Plus, while occasionally annoying, Python 2.6 doesn't impose a significant maintenance burden.  So superficially it would seem that we would totally support Python 2.6.

However, Python 2.6 is unsupported by the upstream Python maintainers, and given the increasingly hostile threat landscape, inconveniencing ourselves even a little bit to provide the false impression that Python 2.6 is a "supported" environment where doing new development is OK is not worthwhile.

"But glyph", I hear my hypothetical interlocutor say, "didn't you just say Windows XP isn't supported?  surely that's more of a security risk than python 2.6!" 

It's true that Windows XP is a worse security risk, but the difference between XP and 2.6 is that we support Windows XP may bean immutable fact of access to some hardware.  According to <http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey <http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey>>, roughly 3% of gamers still use Windows XP, and there's no way for someone writing a Steam game to deliver an OS upgrade along with it, because they don't have access to that environment.  The best we can do there is hope that those people eventually buy new computers.

However, if you're delivering software into a Python 2.6 environment, unless it's an embedded environment without support for 2.7, it is at least to some degree under the "your" control (by "your" I mean the software author, which may be an organization where a particular individual who wants to use Twisted doesn't have a say).  The only such environment I am aware of is Sublime Text 2, which unfortunately did not upgrade to Python 2.7, but Sublime Text 3, which supports Python 3.3, has been out for over 2 years now.

That said, discontinuing Python 2.6 support in this way - simply removing the buildbots and letting people using it on 2.6 eventually start getting syntax errors when they try to import some random module doesn't help to communicate this intent very well.

To that end, I'd like to propose that we follow suit with the Cryptography project, and emit a DeprecationWarning in 15.3.  When you 'pip install cryptography' into a 2.6 environment today, it says:

.../site-packages/cryptography/__init__.py:25: DeprecationWarning: Python 2.6 is no longer supported by the Python core team, please upgrade your Python.

We could say something similar, adding something like "16.0 will not support python 2.6 and may not work at all in your application".

I don't think it would be worthwhile to do this in every possible unsupported / de-supported environment, but this affects a particularly large audience, many of whom may be ignorant of the issues at stake.  <https://caremad.io/2015/04/a-year-of-pypi-downloads/ <https://caremad.io/2015/04/a-year-of-pypi-downloads/>> indicates that roughly 10% of Python users are still stuck on some version of Python 2.6; hopefully Cryptography will be exerting some subtle pressure to get those numbers down.

Hm... It's like my mail client decided to do an "Undo" right before sending.

This should say:

"I don't think we covered terribly well why we are dropping support.  So I'm going to give my take on this, and if Hawkie's differs, hopefully she can expand on that."

Hi JP,

I know that this would leave OS X uncovered -- lukasa, habnabit, and Adi have at separate points offered OS X builders of varying OS levels and even Python versions, both on the mailing list and in #twisted-dev (where Lukasa answered the call from this email and offered a Yosemite builder today), which is why I am confident that this will not end up being an issue when 15.3's first prerelease is issued.

I think the prevailing reason that we don't have an OS X 2.7 bot is that last time OS X hardware was offered, the buildbot was not being actively maintained. I've taken up the mantle in some capacity and getting Twisted supported on more platforms is my primary goal. And as an OS X user, I have some vested interest in it continuing being supported.

I think JP's point is that instead of saying "the OS X builder is going away, and if someone steps up there will be another one" we should say "we will make alternate plans for OS X before shutting off 2.6 support".  I'm inclined to agree; if it's not going to be hard to do the upgrade anyway, we should make it a precondition.

This prompted me to see if the existing builder could be upgraded.  I thought the hardware was unsupported, but I hadn't checked.  I think I was wrong, and it is now downloading Yosemite.  (For the third time.  Trying to do this download on the first day of WWDC may not have been the greatest idea.)

I think that new hardware would still be preferable because this machine is old, slow, overtaxed, and unreliable.  For example, it runs Speed Center as well as the OS X builder.  We have redundancy in most of our other builders now, which is very useful especially during times of heavy activity, like sprints, where lots of concurrent builds are going on, but this is the sole OS X builder.

Another area where redundancy would be nice is when doing upgrades.  For example, if the download ever finishes, I'm going to pull the trigger on this Yosemite upgrade, and ... hopefully it works?  If it doesn't, we will have zero Mac builders until someone in the data center that is donating hosting can plug a console into that machine and see why it didn't finish booting.  There's not really a good way to manage this right now.

Finally, it would be nice to actually support multiple pythons on multiple OS versions - all the still supported / updated ones, anyway - and we'd need multiple builders for that.

15.3 is the last release *with* Python 2.6 support -- that is, the 2.6 builders will be on the supported list until at least 15.3 is released. The goal is that we have both 2.6 and 2.7 on OS X tested before 15.3's release.

I would much prefer to have a new builder to take up the role, migrate the buildslave roles, and then upgrade the existing 10.6 slave once we have something new working. That way, if something goes wrong during the upgrade, we maintain a supported OS X builder.

-----

I think I've been failing at communication a bit -- a prerequisite of dropping 2.6 support has always hinged on getting 2.7 (and optionally 3.3/3.4) builders for platforms that only had 2.6. I have a RHEL7 builder in the wings to get that platform supported, Debian has 7 & 8 now supported, and there's OS X, which I am confident I can get 2.7 builders set up for before 15.3.

I agree with all of this with one minor caveat - there are currently two 
OS X slaves:

  http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/buildslaves/bot-exarkun-1
  http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/buildslaves/osuosl-osx10.6

(and incidentally if someone wants to rename the former I think that'd 
be nice).

Heh, good to know!  Is it possible to remotely administer the latter?

Hi John,

Glyph's discussing the other Mac Mini hosted by the Oregon State University Open Source Lab -- the EGH one is the one we upgraded tonight to 10.10 and is now our first supported 10.10-py27 builder (http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/osx10.10-py2.7/builds/6). So everything's all good with that :)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Unsupported buildbots and future supported
	platforms
Message-ID: <08145D75-792F-4658-9D6B-1BF2353BE6FB@atleastfornow.net>

Glyph and I have been discussing the state of "unsupported" buildbots for the Twisted project, and some of the cleanup of unsupported platforms that I've been doing. To get the reasons for this, and an idea of the future out, Glyph suggested I post to the mailing list.

In the past, a lot of the unsupported buildbots were platforms that we knew didn't work. A lot of these have been tested for many months, kept in the unsupported list, and not had much progress. We need to focus on the unsupported builders that have a path to being supported, and get them onto the supported list.

I've now removed broken, absent, or superseded builders, giving us five unsupported builders. These are:

- FreeBSD 10.1, Python 3.4 -- Tests almost pass, waiting on https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7887 to make it all-green. Once it is green, it can move to supported.
- OS X 10.6, Python 2.6, cfreactor -- There are only a few failing tests -- soon, there'll be a OS X 10.10 cfreactor builder (once we get XCode installed on it :) )
- Python 3K Warnings -- Two failures, which are warnings counting -- should be trivial.
- Ubuntu Trusty, Python 2.7, wxreactor -- broken, needs fixing
- Ubuntu Trusty, PyPy 2.4. -- 32 failing tests http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/builders/trusty64-pypy-2.4/builds/132/steps/trial/logs/problems . Some are pypy, some are configuration related.

These builders should ideally move into the 'supported' list in the future. To do this, we need to:

- Get https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7887 reviewed to get the FreeBSD 10.1 + Python 3.4 builder as a supported platform
- Fix https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7931 to make the Python 3K Warnings builder pass
- Get a new OS X 10.10 cfreactor builder, to see what failures there are on Python 2.7
- Redeploy the wxreactor builder, see what failures there are. I'm planning to do this on a newly deployed Ubuntu 15.04 machine when I get time.
- File more tickets in https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/query?group=status&milestone=PyPy-support for the failures on the PyPy builder and fix them. I'm planning on also doing a PyPy 2.6 builder using the aforementioned Ubuntu 15.04 buildbot, using the PPA, which should shake out the new dict-sorting bugs.

If you would like to see these builders become supported in the future, please do consider helping out! :)

Hi everyone,

Just so you know, Twisted has had two more builders added to the supported list. These are:

- FreeBSD 10.1 with Python 2.7
- Apple OS X 10.10 Yosemite with Python 2.7

Many thanks to Tavendo for the FreeBSD builder and Glyph for updating one of our OS X 10.6 builders to 10.10 so that I could get Python 2.7 builds running on it.

Dear list,

I've tried running Twisted 15.2.1 with my old library, and I am
getting an exception, that I haven't seen before (with Twisted
14.0.0):

      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/txthings/coap.py",
line 1338, in sendResponse
        print "Token: %s" % (response.token)
      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/twisted/logger/_io.py",
line 163, in write
        string = string.decode(self._encoding)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/encodings/utf_8.py", line 16, in decode
        return codecs.utf_8_decode(input, errors, True)
    exceptions.UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xae
in position 7: invalid start byte

Although it is triggered by simple print, it seems to be caused by
logging. Does new logging framework need any configuration to stay
compatible with the old one?

Best regards
Maciej Wasilak

If there were a problem I definitely would have sent a direct email - thank you for keeping an eye on the mailing list though, it's great to know people are paying attention :).

Thanks for writing up the plan like this, Amber.  It sounds like a lot of these plans are really quite far along and we might not have any unsupported builders soon, which would be quite an accomplishment.

Although logger is reacting to this in a bad way, and that is a bug, your program has a bug too: you are printing to a text file (which is what stdout is when it is redirected to a log) by using binary data.  python 3 will mangle your output if you try to do this, so you should restrict your program to unicode if you intend to redirect stdout to a logger.

Here's a very simple example which provokes the same bad behavior:

import sys
from twisted.logger import globalLogBeginner, textFileLogObserver
globalLogBeginner.beginLoggingTo([textFileLogObserver(sys.stdout)])
print(b"Testing testing, one \xae two.")

The equivalent in old-style logging would be:

import sys
from twisted.python.log import startLogging
startLogging(sys.stdout)
print(b"Testing testing, one \xae two.")

Therefore this is a regression in the new logging system.  I've filed it as a bug, here: <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7933 <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7933>>.  In the future, I would encourage you to take advantage of the pre-release testing period to discover issues like this, since it would have been nice to know about this before the final release went out ;-).  (Not to say this is your fault though, this is totally our bug, and I'm surprised we didn't catch it given all the other similar stuff we caught before the release.)

2. If you don't hear back after applying please get in touch with me. 

3. I've edited that slightly to make it clearer what we want when you

Thank you for your help. I'll update my library, and replace all
occurences of print with log.msg("").

I've found the problem only after installing PyPI package with
'twisted>=14.0.0' dependency on new system. Sorry!
Thanks again for excellent work!

No need to apologize!  There's an implied question here, which is: is there any way we can make the prerelease process work better for you?  Some channel where we could communicate it where you'd notice?  Some way to fit it into your workflow?

I've seen this announcement coming every year or so, and as your link 
above said:

I never saw here, or anywhere else AFAIK, besides Tom Prince write ups 
when he got hired, reports of the progress made through this fellow ship.
Did I miss anything or is there another public place than this mailing 
list where I could find the previous fellow ship reports?

Thanks!

We haven't had anyone do this for a while, and in fact unless I'm
misremembering Tom was the last person to do it. So not sure there's
much to look at besides what Tom wrote.

How can I set up Emacs so it gives me inline warnings of Twisted coding
standard violations?

I use flycheck <http://www.flycheck.org/> in Emacs for most projects, and
rely a lot on it. How can I configure it to use twistedchecker
<https://github.com/twisted/twistedchecker> for syntax checks for Twisted
instead of its default flake8 & pylint checkers?

Thanks,

If you sort this out nicely, please share :).  One problem I've had with setting up automatic flymake checking in Twisted is that I cannot figure out how to get it to show me deltas from trunk.  Branches with gigantic unrelated cleanups in them are hard to review, and I don't want my editor yelling at me about changes that aren't in my additions or changes.  (Except when I'm working on a branch whose _goal_ is cleanups, in which case I do).

However, buildbot does this somehow, so it must be possible :).

If I were to try to solve that particular problem, here's what I'd do:

   - add a thing to the checker to allow you to provide a file of known,
   suppressed warnings; the checker would also warn if expected warnings
   weren't there
   - add a Python unit test that fails if there are warnings issued that
   aren't known, or "known" warnings that have gone away
   - kill the dedicated twistedchecker builder
   - whenever I fix up warnings, also modify that file
   - any lint warnings that I wished to legitimately suppress (not just to
   enable incremental migration) I'd disable with comments in the file

Before I did that, I'd make sure the version of twistedchecker was pinned,
because new versions are likely to add/remove warnings. I'd also probably
have a round of massively relaxing twistedchecker's rules.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Should the CFFI wrapper and functions for win32 be
	a separate project?
Message-ID: <CAEgpGv5hA-WwshVRK=hn0x=Y3W=nSh6W1OX+55cnWe7J39W2og@mail.gmail.com>

As the subject says, could the CFFI wrappers around the win32 functions
that Twisted needs be a separate project? This came up briefly in
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7889 so I thought I might pose the
question to a larger audience.

Generally speaking, the idea of making it a separate project to me seems
like a logical step in many ways.  Since the code is not specific to
Twisted keeping it outside of the Twisted project, much like pywin32 is,
makes it easier for contributors and consumers alike to reuse or expand on
the cffi wrapper in the future.  I don't think the objective would be to
replace all of pywin32 initially but to provide enough to be usable by the
Twisted project.

Besides Twisted I know there are some other projects out there that could
benefit from making this a separate project.  But before taking this
approach however I'm wondering if this would be reasonable from Twisted's
perspective?

I think this would be great.

More generally, now that we have support for setuptools extras, I think we might want to consider moving _all_ C/CFFI/Pyrex code outside of Twisted, and making them optional dependencies.  In principle, you should be able to use Twisted without a C compiler, it's just that setuptools has no good way to express that.  But it does have (via extras) a way to express optional dependencies, and if we distributed all the native bindings and speedups as separate packages, we could ultimately fix <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3586 <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3586>> this way.

I think a separate Windows CFFI project is definitely the way to go.
Allows you to focus on the core interfaces required by Twisted and let's
others focus on their own specific areas of interest without duplicating
effort.
I know we'd make use of CFFI into the Windows Crypto modules, for example.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Proposal -- Code of Conduct
Message-ID: <CAOA_4jBv3vv=pYcte7gQ6E8YjKzfBe+1HsPazYak4G=wJtxSgw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I am sure everyone understands that the Twisted community would love more
diversity. While it is hard to achieve, it should be easy to remove one of
the obvious blockers -- making underrepresented groups feel more welcome.

I think, and hope, that our IRC channel, our issue system and mailing list
have been a friendly, pleasant place. This is an attempt to clarify what we
mean by a "friendly, pleasant place".

After some discussion on IRC, I volunteered to write up a Code of Conduct
for Twisted. It is mostly an adaptation of Django's CoC -- I think Django
has a nice track record of commitment to diversity, and, of course, we
expect our communities to overlap.

My current draft, including instructions on how to build it, is in
https://github.com/moshez/twisted-coc . I have intentionally not made the
built documents available, in an attempt to avoid someone picking them up
before they're approved by us.

Please respond if there are any concerns about the wording, anything that I
missed and anything you think does not belong there. I hope we can achieve
consensus, and have the Project Leadership Committee approve this
(including approving the current committee -- I've volunteered to chair it,
and Glyph and Amber (HawkOwl) have graciously agreed to be on it.)

Thanks,
Moshe Z.

The one thing I'm wondering here is why we have our own CoC.  Particularly...

> My current draft, including instructions on how to build it, is in https://github.com/moshez/twisted-coc <https://github.com/moshez/twisted-coc> . I have intentionally not made the built documents available, in an attempt to avoid someone picking them up before they're approved by us. 

Why isn't this repository either (A) just a simple text file saying "we have adopted the Django CoC" or (B) a very small fork of something else?  One of the concerns is licensing; if the text comes via Django, Django credits the "Speak Up!" project, which is CC-BY, apparently from this repository: <https://github.com/jnoller/talk-mentorship>.  Another is... is Twisted really distinct enough to need its own CoC?  Just s/Django/Twisted might be good enough?  (Since this is not a fork, figuring out if anything else has changed is rather tedious, even after having read both ;)).

Thanks again,

I wonder whether it might make sense to just say we adopt https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/ <https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/> ?

What I would really love is if we could have our own diversity statement like Django has: https://www.djangoproject.com/diversity/ <https://www.djangoproject.com/diversity/>

The Django one is more explicit -- it's rather sad that it needs to be, but it does lay out more directly the unacceptable behaviours.

That being said, it's not an unchangeable document -- if it doesn't suit the community's needs, we can modify it to suit.

So that CoCs are just a set of rules to ban users expressed in a vague
legal form, so that people can not complain, because they don't
understand. Is that right? =)

Some repilies to all the issues mentioned here:

1. I think we should definitely maintain our own copy. Sorry for it not
being a fork, the only non-formatting changes I made are things that
referrred to the Django-run events (since we don't run events -- I did
replace some of this language with mention of the meetup group). As for
CC-BY: I did refer to the Django CoC, I thought CC-BY only refers to the
"last point of copying". If it makes sense to add Speak Up! to the mention
for license compliance, I'm happy to do that.

2. The Django CoC specifically has a change procedure. I did not copy that
part over, since our organization is a lot less formal -- I'm pretty sure
it's "if the PLC agrees". I think it's a problem that we don't have the
names of the people on the PLC on our wiki, but this is a separate issue.
[It should be rectified, as well as clarifying the rules for how the PLC
acquires/retires members.

3. I considered briefly the PSF one. I think it is *way* under-specified. I
want to have something that's clear. I think Django, specifically, has a
pretty good track record of promoting diversity and the PSF has a...worse
one.

4. A CoC has several purposes, and "banning people" is actually pretty far
down the list. The first reason is that we assume most people are good
people, or at least wish to follow the rules, and having clear rules about
what's not acceptable will hopefully lead to people voluntarily complying.
The second reason is to send out a message to underrepresented groups: "we
value you, and will protect your right to be treated with dignity in our
community". While this does not solve diversity problems by itself, it is
an important step. A distant third, in my opinion, is the banning of people
-- not least because this issue has not really come up [some people got
banned from IRC, I believe, but usually not for the kind of reasons
described in the CoC, and I don't remember people getting banned from Trac
or the ML]. I really did mean what I said in my first e-mail: we do try to
be an open and inclusive place. We are *already* complying with the CoC.
[If you subscribe to a Hyackean view of law and legislation, this is law,
not legislation.]

5. Not a reply to an e-mail, but I like to publicly call out Hyneck for
actually reading through the CoC, noticing a couple of mistakes and sending
me a pull-request. It is much appreciated!

Thanks everyone who took the time to read and think about this important
issue,
Moshe Z.

Hi everyone,

I am sure everyone understands that the Twisted community would love more
diversity. While it is hard to achieve, it should be easy to remove one of
the obvious blockers -- making underrepresented groups feel more welcome.

I think, and hope, that our IRC channel, our issue system and mailing list
have been a friendly, pleasant place. This is an attempt to clarify what we
mean by a "friendly, pleasant place".

After some discussion on IRC, I volunteered to write up a Code of Conduct
for Twisted. It is mostly an adaptation of Django's CoC -- I think Django
has a nice track record of commitment to diversity, and, of course, we
expect our communities to overlap.

My current draft, including instructions on how to build it, is in
https://github.com/moshez/twisted-coc . I have intentionally not made the
built documents available, in an attempt to avoid someone picking them up
before they're approved by us.

Please respond if there are any concerns about the wording, anything that I
missed and anything you think does not belong there. I hope we can achieve
consensus, and have the Project Leadership Committee approve this
(including approving the current committee -- I've volunteered to chair it,
and Glyph and Amber (HawkOwl) have graciously agreed to be on it.)

Thanks,
Moshe Z.


I've noticed several typos in the Reporting Guidelines section 
(reporting.rst)

I hope this is the appropriate place to report them.

* first sentence of the 4th paragraph of the "What Happens..." section.
  The last word is "response", should be "respond"

* Last sentence of the same paragraph: "Finally, the Working Group will 
make a report on the situation to the DSF board. The board may choose to 
a public report of the incident."  Should be TSF board, not DSF board, and
needs a verb in the final clause, probably "make".

Also, more substantively, the first possible response is "Nothing (if we
determine no violation occurred)."  Maybe I'm just too literal, but I
think there should be a positive response to every report, even if that
response is "We've decided not to do anything", so the reporter knows the
report has been seen and thought about and hasn't just fallen through the
cracks.

Another note, someone earlier implied that since Twisted doesn't sponsor
events, the event-related parts of the Django CoC were irrelevant.  In
the past, there have been several local bug-fixing sprints, one of which
I almost actually attended.  I would think these would qualify as events
and the issues for a CoC when people meet in person may be somewhat
different from when we meet online.


Otherwise, I strongly support this and am happy the Twisted Project is
taking a proactive stance on it.  Great work, everyone, and thank you
Moshe, Glyph and Amber!

Message-ID: <CAP91sFXDYgihevXXvuDpVVBUp43KT=FYT31XnsmSJ8aTKYWQtQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

My controller code first updates DB and then sends out 201 status code
indicating it is done updating in DB.
Issue is somebody waiting to fetch this update from DB will not work
immediately because DB update takes some time(approximately 0.5 second) to
come into effect.

Is there a way I can control/defer sending out 201?
Any sample code/link will be appreciated.

Vikas

Not that I'm a heavy contributor, but:

   - A CoC is like a ToS in many ways.  They rarely get read until there's
   a problem.
   - A CoC is like a License in many ways.  They should be pretty standard
   infrastructure.

I think both of these facts argue for joining Twisted to an existing CoC.
No one goes around reading the CoC for every group they participate in. We
increase the odds that someone reads our CoC if they get leverage (one
read, lots of groups) and we get spill-over (they read the CoC for another
group and thus know ours).

If an extremely common library (think JSON handler) lacks a feature, we
don't start by creating yet another fork.  We make the case to fix
upstream. We only consider forking if we can't get upstream fixed. A CoC is
no different. In fact, a CoC is likely even more generic than a JSON
library -- I have to wonder what's so special about a CoC that we'd need a
fork!  If we use the upstream CoC, we also benefit from improvements
contributed by others.

I agree with Clayton's points. Please pick a code of conduct that others
have used. Avoid the desire to specialize.

I like the PSF code of conduct, http://bit.ly/psf-coc but any well regarded
CoC will do.

Stephen.

I'm going to come out strongly against using the PSF CoC. It is woefully
inadequate, it includes no mechanisms for reporting, and as any PSF member
who has been on certain mailing lists knows it is actually completely
unenforceable.

Enforcing CoCs is hard, and to that end I don't think adding a section
to the PSF CoC indicating who will act as arbiter for enforcement and
what the stages of remediation available to the arbiters are.

With all due respect ;), that is not a well-formed sentence ...
this part of it:

"adding a section
to the PSF CoC indicating who will act as arbiter for enforcement and
what the stages of remediation available to the arbiters are"

is a noun phrase.  So you said "I don't think [noun phrase]."
I suspect you want to say "I don't think [noun phrase] would be
difficult." ... or something like that.

While it should not in theory be difficult to update the PSF CoC, in
practice I expect it would be quite difficult for the simple reason that:

"This document was approved by the membership of the Python Software
Foundation during the vote which concluded on 19 April 2013."

Implying that any updates to the CoC would also need to be approved by a
vote of the membership.

So while it'd be nice for the PSF CoC to be updated such that it was
enforceable I think that should block adoption of a CoC by the Twisted
Project.

I'm a +1 on adopting the Django CoC.

I'm not picky which CoC we use, but the fact that upstream requires
approval shouldn't disqualify PSF. Part of my argument is that our
contributions benefit a larger community. If PSF needs an enforcement
clause, they might be more than willing to adopt the change -- and a bigger
community would certainly benefit.

The goal should be to participate in and contribute to something broad.
PSF woudl be great.  A little Googling identified some other referenced
CoCs (Twitter, Ubuntu, GDC, OSI, Gnome, Mozilla) -- see
https://openhatch.org/wiki/Project_codes_of_conduct for these and more
examples -- as well as the "Contributor Covenant" that claims ~30 projects
as participants and accepts PRs:

http://contributor-covenant.org/


It seems likely that at least one of these options provides both a good
starting point and an acceptable governance policy.

Can you supply an <http://sscce.org <http://sscce.org/>> that demonstrates your problem?  There are definitely solutions but it sort of depends on exactly how you want this to work.  Also, what database are you using?

I hope that you meant

>> I don't think that should block adoption…


unless you meant you thought it should block adoption of the PSF CoC?

In any case, to try to cover some concerns raised so far:

>> Why the Django CoC rather than the PSF (or, the quite-similar Contributor Covenant)?


There are two reasons: specificity, and reporting.

Specificity is important because of course, everyone wants to be reasonable.  The point of having a code of conduct is outlining what "reasonable" means in our specific context.  Given the difficulties the software industry has had in the last couple of decades with respecting its marginalized members, it's important to take that context into account and say what (sadly) might not be obvious to people.

Clarity around how reporting violations works is important because people who are already feeling harassed in their day-to-day existence are often not going to be comfortable poking around trying to figure out how to deal with a violation of the code on their own.  Most likely, they will simply quietly exit the community.  So it should be as easy as possible to report.

>> Why isn't this a fork of an existing CoC?

I agree that this is a problem.  Django does not appear to have their CoC in an easily-forkable format.  Perhaps we should contact the Django project and ask them to rectify that so that we can make minor tweaks.  We also do need minor tweaks, because the information about contact points for reporting has to be different for different projects.

I'd also like to raise two issues of my own.  In his original message, Moshe said this:

> I think, and hope, that our IRC channel, our issue system and mailing list have been a friendly, pleasant place.

For the most part, I believe this is true, and I think we have managed to be a welcoming and pleasant environment for all concerned.  However, I don't want anyone to get a false sense of confidence from this, and think that we're doing great since we've never had any incidents.  The nature of such incidents is to remain private.  In Twisted's decade-plus of history, especially on IRC, I have had to personally adjudicate several disputes, and we have definitely had potential contributors quietly disappear from the community due to apparent hostility or inappropriate remarks.  We have certainly had to ban people from the channel, on at least one occasion permanently.  There have not been any particularly severe, particularly public or particularly recent incidents, but there has definitely been some unpleasantness at times. So, while I do believe we are doing well, there is unquestionably room to improve.

Thank you all so very much for not making me type that as a reply to anyone saying we don't need a CoC ;-).

Also, I would like to stress that I personally believe that this is a 1.0-release type of effort, and in no way a finished product.  I have lots of concerns with fairness and transparency in the way disputes are handled, and the list of possible responses, but what we have right now (i.e.: the personal judgement of whatever committer happens to be online at the time) is definitely far worse.  So I expect that the work will continue and we will see revisions to this, hopefully in collaboration with other projects so that Twisted developers aren't taking this on, Django being the obvious example.

Russ has informed me that it's accessible on https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/blob/master/djangoproject/templates/conduct/index.html -- so we could potentially fork the repo and make it just that file or so :)

Thanks for the location - but I figured there was a file somewhere in version control :).  It would still be great if Django could split this out into a separate project so we could contribute changes back as well.

I'm generally +1 on the idea of having a CoC.

I'm content to delegate the details to subcommittee, so maybe I should
leave it at that, but I find there's one point I want to reinforce here:

Agreed. Clayton said "They rarely get read until there's a problem," but
I think prevention and expectation-setting are things to aim for here.
If people only find out about what's acceptable conduct *after* there's
a problem, that's too late.

Agreed. (I am one of the current PLC members.)

Hi everyone,

I'm sorry I haven't responded to the e-mails -- I have had a busy weekend,
and my stack was a bit deep for personal projects. I will try to get caught
up and see what the right next step is on Monday.

Thanks for your understanding,
Moshe Z.
