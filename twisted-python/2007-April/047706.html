<PRE>Hi jml

|<i> On 4/10/07, Terry Jones &lt;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">terry at jon.es</A>&gt; wrote:
</I>|<i> Thanks for writing such a full email too. This sort of thing really

</I>
Great. I also always find it useful to have outsiders and first-timers make
comments. It's probably impossible to look with fresh eyes at things you've
spent a ton of time working on. I know I can't do it - partly through lack
of time, energy, inclination :-)

|<i> &gt;   - Go to <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/</A> and click on Twisted Projects.
</I>|<i> &gt;     Click on Twisted Trial.  There's nothing there, just a link to
</I>|<i> &gt;     thoughts on future dev and a link into the tracker.
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> This is an unfortunate situation. Part of the issue is that Trial is a
</I>|<i> significantly-sized, relatively independent part of Twisted Core, so
</I>|<i> it falls into something of an organisational nether-world.
</I>
OK, but that wiki page is your chance to say so, or say something.

|<i> It's interesting that you didn't consider looking into Twisted's
</I>|<i> documentation to find out more about Trial.
</I>
&gt;<i>From the home page I go to <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Documentation">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Documentation</A>
</I>and I don't see a link for Trial. Part of what's misleading here is that
there are explicit links for various projects, and Trial is listed as a
project on the page I just came from. So, a specific recommendation: add
Trial to the list of projects, and say &quot;Trial is documented in the core
documentation&quot; with a link.

Following your suggestion, I now click on Core Documentation. On the page I
land on, I immediately search for Trial, but there is no hit. Specific rec:
add the word Trial somewhere on this page so users and Google etc. can see
it.

But I do see a link called &quot;Tips for writing tests for Twisted code&quot;. Is
that or is that not Trial documentation I wonder? The destination page is
howto/testing.html and at the top it does look like I've arrived at the
right place. Is that what you meant? But after a few sentences it does
degenerate into tips that are too advanced. Shouldn't someone tell me for
example what Twisted class I should subclass in making a test suite, before
telling me to leave the reactor (what reactor? thinks the newbie) as I
found it?

|<i> &gt;   - Back on the Twisted site I look for a search box, and there is one.
</I>|<i> &gt;     Yay. Enter 'trial' and I get back 76+ pages of hits, the first of
</I>|<i> &gt;     which is virtually all trac issue links, plus some mention of monkey
</I>|<i> &gt;     patching, which doesn't sound relevant.
</I>|<i> 
</I>|<i> OK, now that is Trac's fault. You'll notice that the Trac search page
</I>|<i> lets you uncheck the &quot;Ticket&quot; and &quot;Changeset&quot; boxes so that you can
</I>|<i> just search the wiki. It's not particularly intuitive.
</I>
Can the default be changed to just search the wiki? Perhaps just on
searches from the main page? That looks like it would just be a matter of
dropping changeset=on and ticket=on from the URL.  I know, that's probably
a trac thing, but it might help.

|<i> groff -man -Tascii doc/core/man/trial.1  | less
</I>
Thanks. I'm old :-)  And on my machine:

    $ file /usr/bin/nroff
    /usr/bin/nroff: Bourne shell script text executable
    $ grep Emulate /usr/bin/nroff
    # Emulate nroff with groff.

|<i> I'm guessing the confusion here is that you weren't expecting the
</I>|<i> Trial docs to be under 'core'?
</I>
Yes, that's part of it (see above about seeing Trial listed as a project
but then not seeing it under the projects on the main doc page).

|<i> <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.trial.html">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.trial.html</A>
</I>
So I did!  That's great, thanks. It's exactly the kind of doc I'd like to
be reading - nicely fomatted and giving confidence that it's clearly
machine generated (and therefore stands a chance of being up to date).

A link to that page would have really helped.

|<i> Right. I think it's a good policy to explicitly recommend reading code
</I>|<i> if there aren't any better docs.
</I>
Me too. And the doc strings in the code are (relatively) pretty good.

|<i> Rest assured, this email is definitely valuable. So, although you may
</I>|<i> have been able to do better stuff, you are certainly making my job
</I>|<i> easier.
</I>
And vice versa (much more of the vice versa, of course). So thanks back.

|<i> Thomas is working on a better Trial document which should solve some
</I>|<i> of these problems. The presentation on the website is a separate, and
</I>|<i> possibly more pressing issue, which I'll file a bug for.
</I>
I'll make some interim cosmetic changes to the wiki if you like. (Where
interim has its usual meaning: will only be there for a couple of years...)

|<i> In the interim, if you have any problems using Trial, you can (almost)
</I>|<i> always contact me on IRC.
</I>
OK, thanks.

Terry
