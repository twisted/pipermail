agreed, it's what i wrote in the email i've just sent out. if you look at 
some parts of twisted, like pb, and actually try to use them, you'll find 
that it's extremely liberating and useful not to have things hidden from you 
because this sort of infantilization can only end in tears. continuing with 
the pb example, based on personal experience, not having the network 
communications disguised and hidden from you by ordinary function calls 
makes writing non-trivial code practical, nevermind easy. i can't tell you 
how many projects i've seen that used this hiding back when it was en vogue, 
and all of them to a t were either completely borked or barely functional. 
this is all about having the tools to deal with the problem domain using 
concepts that map it properly - you can't deal with asynchrony without 
having it reified, with every consequence that entails. i spent a 
non-trivial amount of time a long time ago playing with generators, bytecode 
hacks and preprocessors to hide this stuff (it's not as damaging to hide it 
selectively once you already thoroughly understand what's going on under the 
hood) and came to the conclusion that i was wrong to want that. now if i 
could do the same with cigarettes and beer .. ;]

cheers,
