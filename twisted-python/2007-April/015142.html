<PRE>Hi u1CtDC,

&gt;<i>Q1: How to determine a function is 'blocking action' or not?
</I>&gt;<i>Any function needs CPU times. Indeed, a computational-intensive
</I>&gt;<i>function is blocking action. But how small/fast function can be
</I>&gt;<i>classified as non-blocking? Twist requires all user functions to be
</I>&gt;<i>non-blocked. If reactor calls a blocking function, what will happen?
</I>&gt;<i>In my mind, reactor maintains a command queue internally (just like
</I>&gt;<i>windows message queue). The blocking function only postpones the
</I>&gt;<i>execution of other queued functions, but it does not break the logic
</I>&gt;<i>of the program. Is that right?
</I>
You've basically answered your own question here.  A &quot;blocking action&quot; 
is one where your users will not want to wait for it :).
&gt;<i>Q2: Today when I go through the twist document, I am confused about
</I>&gt;<i>the threading problem in reactor.
</I>&gt;<i>What is the different between 'reactor.callFromThread' and a plain
</I>&gt;<i>call in reactor loop?
</I>&gt;<i>def callFromThread(f):
</I>&gt;<i>            self.threadCallQueue.append((f, args, kw))
</I>&gt;<i>            self.wakeUp()
</I>&gt;<i>It seems equivalent to reactor.callLater(0, f...).
</I>&gt;<i>What is the real circumstance for calling callFromThread?
</I>
callLater is not thread-safe.  callFromThread is designed to be called, 
well, from a thread.  You use callFromThread from threads *other* than 
the thread where the reactor is running, in order to wake up the reactor 
thread and have it do something - usually something that involves 
calling a non-thread-safe Twisted API.
&gt;<i>Further more, how to determine a function is thread-safe in python?
</I>
As in any other language, ask the person who wrote it.  There is no 
other way to determine if a function is thread-safe.  In any language 
with dynamic run-time dispatch, determining this without talking to the 
author of the code in question reduces to the halting problem.
&gt;<i>Why the twist doc says: &quot;writing data to a transport from a protocol
</I>&gt;<i>is not thread-safe.&quot;?
</I>
Nothing in Twisted is thread-safe (other than callFromThread) but this 
is a particularly common error and we wanted to stress it.
&gt;<i>Q3: In my application, I need a facility to dynamically select a
</I>&gt;<i>protocol to communicate with the server.
</I>&gt;<i>Eg: When connected, the server sent a string to client to indicate the
</I>&gt;<i>version of protocol it used. Then, the client can load the proper
</I>&gt;<i>protocol. But I don't know how to implement this. A 'Factory' can only
</I>&gt;<i>create one kind of 'Protocol', and it seems the instances of
</I>&gt;<i>'Protocol' cannot share the connection (Transport object) to a server.
</I>&gt;<i>Could you give me some clues?
</I>
The protocol that you are implementing includes a &quot;version&quot; message. 
Unless you have a &quot;Protocol&quot; object connected to receive the data and 
decode that message, you can't decide which version to use for 
subsequent messages.  Simply implement a &quot;Protocol&quot; which understands 
that &quot;version&quot; message and changes its behavior accordingly.

For an example of how you might switch to a completely different 
protocol object, see

<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk/twisted/protocols/amp.py#L1524">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk/twisted/protocols/amp.py#L1524</A>

The techniques involved are quite nuanced, however, and are probably not 
appropriate for someone just learning about Twisted.
