Hi All,

I have to say that I am largely getting along famously with Twisted  
(and Python) now.

I have started writing unit tests for my application and when I run  
them using trial I sometimes get DirtyReactorErrors ('reactor left in  
unclean state'). This is a nice error. It tells me that I am not  
shutting down resources correctly which would otherwise be left  
hanging around and be difficult to debug.

I understand why this is occurring, its a simple matter of calling  
tcp.Port.stopListening() to suppress the error. However, I am more  
concerned with learning about where the most appropriate place to run  
this routine would be. I am not happy about running it in the unit  
test as it doesn't solve the problem, it just suppresses it. I can't  
seem to find an easy way to stop a port from listening from within a  
ServerFactory. Should I be writing a class that wraps the  
ServerFactory to run tcp.Port.stopListening() at the appropriate time?

Please bear in mind that I am creating multiple 'one-shot' servers  
that are always shut down as soon as they have done their business. I  
am guessing that the stopService methods would be more appropriate  
for a conventional server that serves multiple clients / requests.

Your thoughts?

Thanks a lot for your time :)

Matt
