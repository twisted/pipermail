</I>&gt;<i> Twisted already does:
</I>
Whew. :) I certainly don't plan to re-implement Twisted, since it
already exists and it's ace; I want something at a higher level. My aim
here is to make my existing application(s) even more modular so that
functionality can be added and extended in a simple, common way. This
principle has already provided excellent benefits in the past.

&gt;<i> &gt;I have a desire to provide scheduler functionality (at time x, take
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;action y).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds like reactor.callLater().  (Or if you're talking about
</I>&gt;<i> persistent scheduling, axiom's IScheduler.schedule).
</I>
Yes, it will be persistent scheduling, so I'll check out IScheduler. &quot;30
seconds have passed&quot; would most likely be a reactor.callLater(30,
timePassed) thing though, yes, inside an EventProducer type object.

&gt;<i> &gt;Data is received from an external entity by a listener.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds like IProtocol's dataReceived method.
</I>
Yes, and I use it to great effect within the existing code. By listener,
I really mean a daemon process that listens, and there may be many of
them. Rather than have a single, monolithic twistd with many Services, I
think I would prefer a multi-process model so that each individual
process can be started/stopped independently, new ones can be written
that just talk to the event manager API, etc. In this way, the listener
process would purely listen for incoming data (eg: SNMP Traps), and then
talk to the event manager when it does.

In fact, now that I think about it, it would be neat if the event
manager API could allow third party programs to talk to the event
manager via a standard protocol, such as XML-RPC. Such programs could
then be written in the author's favourite language, which may not be
Python+twisted, and potentially operate on remote systems.

&gt;<i> &gt;A program polls for data, succeeds and notifies the event manager of
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;data that was polled. The event manager notifies a 'poll storage'
</I>&gt;<i> object
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that stores the data in the database. It could also notify other
</I>&gt;<i> things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In python, &quot;notifying things&quot; is just calling functions or methods; in
</I>&gt;<i> the most advanced case, it's still just calling functions or methods
</I>&gt;<i> which have been placed into a list.  Twisted has lots of such lists,
</I>&gt;<i> and it doesn't seem worthwhile to me to unify them into a central
</I>&gt;<i> structure.
</I>
True, though the more I think about it, I think I want an RPC mechanism
of some kind, and I believe Perspective Broker is such a beast? I
haven't really looked at it yet, but I've long been intrigued by what
people have been saying about it.

So it seems I want to add a veneer of RPC to my programs to allow them
to communicate at a distance. Imagine a poller process on one host, an
SNMP trap listener on another, a database storage process on still
another. This sort of modularity would provide excellent scalability.

Any suggestions for people's favourite ways of doing this with twisted?

&gt;<i> If it does make sense to you to unify them, you might want to look at
</I>&gt;<i> Louie: <A HREF="http://pylouie.org/">http://pylouie.org/</A> .  I've never used it and I don't really
</I>&gt;<i> get what it's for, but several folks that I know seem to like it a lot
</I>&gt;<i> for gluing events together.
</I>
I'll check it out.

Thanks for the great responses so far, too. :)
