<PRE>Hello Justin:

&gt;<i>Whew. :) I certainly don't plan to re-implement
</I>&gt;<i>Twisted, since it already exists and it's ace; I want
</I>&gt;<i>something at a higher level. My aim here is to make
</I>&gt;<i>my existing application(s) even more modular so that
</I>&gt;<i>functionality can be added and extended in a simple,
</I>&gt;<i>common way. This principle has already provided
</I>&gt;<i>excellent benefits in the past.
</I>
A good book on Event management is David Luckham's
&quot;The Power of Events: An Introduction to Complex Event
Processing in Distributed Enterprise Systems.&quot;

I think the higher level stuff revolves around the
event pattern language (also known as the trigger
language)- how one defines an event and the mechanisms
for detecting events.  

I am developing a WS-BPEL processor. Not many people
know about WS-BPEL. WS-BPEL is a language that has
event handlers that are based on time and web service
calls. To correctly implement the specification, I
also have to deal with triggering activities based on
patterns in a message or attributes of the SOAP
header.

My experiences so far....

For time based stuff, Twisted is pretty strong (in
opposition - Stackless is weak). I use TaskLoopCall
help implement time and alarm triggered stuff.  

For web services, I have been writing classes that
represent end-point-references based on the WSA
standard. For instance, a tasklet in my WS-BPEL
processor tells (or subscribes to) my &quot;event manager&quot;
that it is interested in a particular EPR (say a SOAP
message with a &quot;buy&quot; operation). In turn, a scheduler
suspends the tasklet. When my Twisted based Request
Handler receives a http request, as a part of the
response, the handler creates an EPR representing the
client end and sends it to the event manager.  If the
&quot;event manager&quot; can match the incoming EPR, it will
ask the scheduler to wake up the associated tasklet.

So far, this works fairly well. For 80% of stuff,
Twisted and Stackless work really well together. My
EPR classes are still pretty rough. However in a month
or two, they should be in better shape. I am not sure
if anyone is really interested but I would be more
than happy to put it out there.

Cheers,
Andrew
