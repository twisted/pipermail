</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Add a spewing decorator which stores all of the function and method
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;calls
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;within a function in a structured data object.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;What ticket is this associated with?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;None, as yet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;I guess we should avoid having branches without tickets.  There's still the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;sandbox to develop stuff where the direction is uncertain.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;What's wrong with renaming the branch to include a ticket number after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;a suitable ticket has been filed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That operation is unsupported by the tool-chain.  But even so, for the
</I>&gt;<i> reasons below, it's better to start things off with a ticket, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> eventually introduce one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I thought the sandbox was for random bits of junk code[1] and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Foolscap, not branches of Twisted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More or less, yes.  Anything goes in the sandbox.  Sticking whole Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> branches there probably isn't the best idea on the world, but developing
</I>&gt;<i> functionality that actually needs to go into the Twisted tree probably also
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be undertaken without some minimal amount of planning.  That's
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to be part of what tickets are for (although I recognize that
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes they do not end up filling that role).  When I suggested the
</I>&gt;<i> sandbox, I really had in mind the development of some spewer-related
</I>&gt;<i> functionality in an independent module with little or no Twisted integration
</I>&gt;<i> (since from a quick look at the branch, that seemed to be what the code
</I>&gt;<i> looked like so far).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In case that's a little too muddled and fuzzy to make sense, here's another
</I>&gt;<i> angle.  A ticket serves as a point where the relevance, utility, correctness,
</I>&gt;<i> whatever, of a change can be discussed.  If someone is interested in some
</I>&gt;<i> development which is taking place, they should be able to find that point
</I>&gt;<i> easily and without interactive assistance from anyone.  If not, their input
</I>&gt;<i> may be lost or delayed until it is useless or integrating it costs more than
</I>&gt;<i> the ultimate payoff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The kind of &quot;just-in-time&quot; ticket creation that already happens so frequently
</I>&gt;<i> in Twisted development is something it would be nice to move away from.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> completely fine to find a bug, create a ticket, and develop a fix in a brief
</I>&gt;<i> period of time and I don't want to discourage that.  However, and this is
</I>&gt;<i> really close to the heart of UQDS, for refactoring and feature enhancements,
</I>&gt;<i> the end result is much improved by input from other people.  Leaving a little
</I>&gt;<i> time between ticket creation and actual development doesn't guarantee that
</I>&gt;<i> any useful input will be offered by other developers, but it at least presents
</I>&gt;<i> the possibility.  If development starts _before_ anyone else even knows what
</I>&gt;<i> it's about, obviously that doesn't present any window at all.  This really
</I>&gt;<i> also applies to bug fixes, but I think it's at least /possible/ in some of
</I>&gt;<i> those cases for the necessary change to be sufficiently straightforward such
</I>&gt;<i> that the process works well enough with only two developers involved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If any of this seems unreasonable, please say so and let's discuss it.  The
</I>&gt;<i> goal here is to make Twisted the best piece of software we can make it,
</I>&gt;<i> nothing else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Thanks for the thoughtful reply.

&gt;<i>From my perspective, the problem here is that strict adherence to UQDS
</I>as described in your email is that there is no real room for
exploratory coding.

At other times, I have wanted to muck around doing some Trial
refactoring, I filed a ticket which stated my intentions with all the
clarity available, something along the lines of &quot;muck around doing
trial refactoring&quot;. I was chastised for filing such a ticket (fair
enough, it's a lousy ticket), so I stopped working along those lines.

This time, I decided to not file a ticket, because I did not want to
prematurely problem of concisely defining my work. I am being
chastised (albeit gently) for such work, and I will probably stop
working on this code.
