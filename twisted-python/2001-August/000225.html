Yay!

Do not despair!  There's only one minor error.

Here's the answer to your problem: you're probably logging in to the
'reality' service.  Unfortunately login error reporting is not the various
PB clients' strong point (bug noted...).  Change the &quot;reality&quot; field on
your login dialog to be 'twisted.reality' and it should work.

Indeed it is.

&gt;<i> I saw some of the other comments on the list earlier re: Windows and
</I>&gt;<i> its lack of a fork() call, and I suspect this is the problem. If

This deficiency of Windows only affects CGI in Twisted.Web.  Given that
the audience for Twisted on Windows is small, and the audience for Twisted
+ CGI is even smaller, I think that this problem will remain unaddressed
until someone who cares about both of these things devotes some time to
fixing it.  So far, J&#252;rgen Hermann is the only person I can think of who
exists in that intersection :-).

&gt;<i> I really would like to help with the reality part of the Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> project, but unless I get access to a Unix OS or Twisted works 100%
</I>&gt;<i> under Windows, I don't know how much I can do :( I am still keen to
</I>&gt;<i> hear what visions the original reality developers had (or have) for
</I>&gt;<i> the future.
</I>
Let me know if this solution fixes your problem.
