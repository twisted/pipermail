<PRE>&gt;<i> From: &quot;M.J. Stahl&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">mjmstahl at one.net</A>&gt;
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; Can someone please give me a general breakdown on getting TRDemo or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Inheritance started.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I got Inheritance running, eventually, under Windows 98. If you'd like the
</I>&gt;<i> details of how, I will post them tomorrow as it is my home machine. I am
</I>at
&gt;<i> work now, so I will most likely post in another 24 hours. I am in
</I>Australia
&gt;<i> (GMT +1000). The Inheritance demo lets you go to lots of places which need
</I>a
&gt;<i> description :) but entry of verbs is not available yet.
</I>
Okay, here it goes...

Note: these are the instructions for getting inheritance going on 0.9.3. I
imagine the instructions will be fairly similar for 0.9.4 and 0.9.5. Hmm,
except for the fact that spl files have been renamed to tap files and
mkserver is replacing mk*server. Anyhow, here is what I did.

* unzip inheritance.tar.gz into Twisted-0.9.3

This places build_map and the inheritance directory in Twisted-0.9.3. If you
plan on creating more than one reality server, you may want to rename
build_map to build_map_inherit to distinguish the build_map files of each
server

* gnusto build_map inherit.rpl mapcopy.py

This creates two files - inherit.rpl and mapcopy.py - from the build_map
file. inherit.rpl can then be used for...

* mkrealityserver inherit.rpl

This creates a file called reality.spl. This can be renamed if you are going
to run more than one world on the reality server. In fact, I would argue for
the case of using the rpl filename as the filename for the spl file, ie
inherit.rpl produces inherit.spl.

* twistd -f reality.spl

This starts the server with the reality.spl file. Start your browser and
point it to 127.0.0.1/8080 and you will see a login screen. The username is
&quot;Damien&quot; and the password is &quot;admin&quot;.

If this doesn't get you going, let me know and I'll try and help you some
more.

Thanks to Glyph for the leg-up to get as far as I did.

If I get time tonight to look at 0.9.5, I will amend the instructions and
repost them.

Also, if the person or people responsible for creating the reality server
and the reality worlds is still on this list, I would like to hear from the
re: how they originally saw this project going when it was set aside. For
instance, was this meant to be a Python web-based version of an Inform
Z-machine or TADS interpreter? Something similar? Something different?

I hope this helps somewhat.

Cheers,
ChrisH
