<PRE>From: &quot;Glyph Lefkowitz&quot; &lt;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">glyph at twistedmatrix.com</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> A command like 'gnusto build_map x.rpl mapcopy.py' in one of the
</I>&gt;<i> Inheritance or TRDemo directories will create 'x.rpl' which you can use
</I>&gt;<i> with mkrealityserver.  HTH.
</I>
This does help, actually.

If anyone is interested, I can write up some notes on how to get various
aspects of TM working on Windows platforms.

Once I put the Inheritance and TRDemo directories in the right places, I was
able to create a .spl file for both Inheritance and TRDemo. There was a
problem with TRDemo - twisted.library is missing. Is this library available
anywhere or has it been superseded? I ran the Inheritance module, and after
going through some code to find the username and password, I was able to run
this successfully. I am now able to move around in the inheritance game, but
that's about it.

Again, if anyone is interested in docs for running any of this, I will be
happy to produce some.

Does anyone know the status of reality servers?

I'm really enjoying playing around with all of this stuff.

Cheers,
ChrisH
