<PRE>[Yes, I do intend to spend some more time digesting this and working it
into code and perhaps more english, but that won't get done tonight...
So for now, Share and Enjoy!]

IRC log started Thu Aug 02 00:06:16 2001 (PDT -0700)

* Acapnotic pokes glyph

&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: sorry, did you answer before?

&lt;Acapnotic&gt; glyph: Ok, I started the log ten minutes ago for
            you, and so far it mainly consists of descriptions of
            thirmite's van =)

&lt;dash&gt; haha

&lt;thirmite&gt; my van is awsome

&lt;dash&gt; &quot;ph34r my l33t v4n&quot;

&lt;thirmite&gt; heh

&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: OK.  Let's get started then. :)
&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: What do you want to do with PB?

&lt;Acapnotic&gt; glyph: whiteboard, say.  client -&gt; server -&gt;
            many-clients.  but we can start with just half of that.

&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: OK.  First thing you need is a whiteboard
        service on the server.
&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: by &quot;service&quot; I literally mean a subclass
        of pb.Service

&lt;Acapnotic&gt; a pb.Service, okay.  That doesn't have many methods 

&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: crap.  I think I may have changed some naming here
	:-).  Does your version say anything about getPerspectiveNamed?

&lt;Acapnotic&gt; glyph: yes, getPerspectiveNamed(self,name) is
            the only method

&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: Ok, cool.
&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: So you have to implement that method to
        retrieve something that represents a viewer of whiteboards

&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: twisted.reality.plumbing can provide an
        example for this.
&lt;glyph&gt; uh, actually twisted.reality.reality.Reality, now
        that I think of it :)

&lt;dash&gt; reality, reality, REALITY! (ta-daa!)
&lt;dash&gt; glyph: you have such a way with names

&lt;Acapnotic&gt; &quot;a viewer&quot; probably being a front-end?  or the client
            that's got a display attached?

&lt;glyph&gt; dash: everybody has a bad day sometimes :-\

&lt;dash&gt; glyph: no, i like it
&lt;dash&gt; it's a as subtle as a jackhammer :)

&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: It's the back-end, not the front-end.  We're still
        on the server.

&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: whatever you return is the thing that the
        authenticated user is going to be able to call methods on; it
        should be a subclass of pb.Perspective

&lt;Acapnotic&gt; ah, okay, I was derailed for a moment there getting stuck
            on &quot;viewer&quot;.  but this isn't just a passive thing, it's
            what we call on to modify the whiteboard as well, ja?

&lt;glyph&gt; yes 
&lt;glyph&gt; hmm, maybe we should do this tomorrow, *AFTER* I check in
        these changes

&lt;Acapnotic&gt; no two days the same, eh?
&lt;Acapnotic&gt; glyph: Ok, then don't give me specifics on every method I
            need to override.  Big picture -- what classes go on which
            end, what talks to what?

&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: welll, after hte handshake we just described,
        you've got a Perspective on the server
&lt;glyph&gt; the client has a Reference to that Perspective
&lt;glyph&gt; so when the client says perspective.foo(bar, baz), the
        server's perspective gets x.perspective_foo(bar, baz) called
        on it

&lt;Acapnotic&gt; glyph: Okay.  And is this one of your &quot;there are no return
            values&quot; areas?
&lt;Acapnotic&gt; yes, because calls are asyncronyous... crap, I can't spell
            these days.

&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: Yes.  There are no return values; if the client
        wants to get a callback when the return value's ready, it
        calls p.foo(bar, baz, pbcallback=qux)

&lt;Acapnotic&gt; glyph: So now I can do whiteboard_author_client-&gt;server.
            To do server-&gt;whiteboard_audience_client, will I flip this
            around and put a &quot;server&quot; in each client?  (a la X)

&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: No need.
&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: You can just have each interested &quot;listener&quot; pass a
        subclass of &quot;pb.Referenced&quot; into a remote callback, which
        defines a method that the server will call.

&lt;Acapnotic&gt; glyph: so I'm just going to stash a bunch of these
            Referenced callbacks in some private attribute, and then
            run through them whenever I want to talk at them?

&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: essentially, yes.

&lt;Acapnotic&gt; glyph: now you said these subclasses_of(pb.Referenced)
            defined a method to call.  Does that mean I should have
            them __call__able?  Or will I call their methods?  Or is
            that entirely up to me?

&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: Subclasess of pb.Referenced define methods named
        remote_XXX; remoteobj.XXX() on the other side will invoke
        those methods.

&lt;Acapnotic&gt; glyph: and I missed a piece of the handshaking.  Where did
            the client/server connection happen?

&lt;glyph&gt; Acapnotic: that's irrelevant :)
&lt;glyph&gt; the way that happens is just you instantiate a tcp.Client with
        a Broker as the protocol
&lt;glyph&gt; all fo these interactions happen through the pb.Broker
&lt;glyph&gt; (requestPerspective, to be precise)

&lt;Acapnotic&gt; ok, that's good to know, I wouldn't call that irrelevant =)

&quot;...we're stopped.&quot;
