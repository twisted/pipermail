<PRE>AUSTIN, TEXAS (AP): Firmly ensconced in his menacing 12-story &quot;fortress of
doom&quot;, Glyph today released Twisted, version 0.10.0.  After the
sun-destroying repercussions of a recent previous release, industry
pundits were cautious with their predictions, standing by their ready
escape pods.

The &quot;fortress of doom&quot;, rumored to be carved from a single, giant block of
basalt is one of the outlying offices of Ninjaneering.  Mr. Lefkowitz was
available for a brief press conference.

Beaming, Glyph proclaimed &quot;With the power of the Ninjas to aid us, there
is no way we can possibly fail!&quot;.  Although he displayed his
characteristic vaguarity about what those goals actually are, he may have
actually meant something this time.

As promised, Twisted 0.10.0 comes with both &quot;enterprise&quot; and the ability
to repair the sun.  Gavin &quot;Skreech&quot; Cooper, immediately after mirroring
the Twisted repository, perfunctorily restored the sun to its former light
and heat providing glory, while Glyph made sure that the Twisted Matrix
Labs website was in working order.  While everything appeared to go
smoothly, Chris Armstrong, press agent for Twisted Matrix, could not be
reached for comment, and sources say that he has fled the country,
possibly to avoid fallout from the 0.10 series of releases.
