This is an admirable goal.

However, from what I understand of Python's threading facilities, even
attribute access is somewhat suspect (as it may invoke a method call).  
At a somewhat fundamental level, what we are doing is manipulating an
internal data structure from one of several different threads.  There is
time spent within a system call that alters this data structure when the
main interpreter lock may not be held.

I think that even theoretically, this requires a lock.  (below I describe
an approach that may reduce the amount of locking...)

&gt;<i> 1) It doesn't actually work - if I turn of the threadble.synchronize()

</I>
Yeah, that's probably the biggest problem with this approach :)

&gt;<i> 2) How can I make the FileDescriptor backwards compatible? Add a custom

</I>
They shouldn't ever be pickled.  In fact, I think that most of them mix in
styles.Ephemeral.

&gt;<i> 3) Will this slow things down?
</I>
Possibly, possibly not.  Difficult to say without profiling data (and
profiling MT applications is notoriously hard...)

&gt;<i> I may just give up and write a ThreadSafeFileDescriptor class,

</I>
One alternative to reduce the number of locks and amount of locking going
on is to establish a different method for writing to a socket from a
thread.  Have the thread-safe version acquire a global lock on writing,
add some data (writer, string) to a global list, and relinquish it.  Then,
at the beginning of each select iteration, acquire that lock once: 

  lock.acquire()
  for writer, data in globalList:
    writer.write(data)
  lock.release()

and then keep all the actual write() calls happening in the one thread.

Another is to have the threaded implementation of write() actually call
socket.makefile('w').write(data); does anyone know the thread safety
implications of that?
