Sorry, no.  If you don't redirect stdout properly, your daemon is broken,
unix or no.

&gt;<i> Agreed.

</I>
Yes.  And it should be strongly deprecated to call daemonize directly.

&gt;<i> &gt; So I'd say daemonize should at least take a logfile, and a function +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; varargs, and never return.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, that's startService, another useful API. 
</I>
I would argue that daemonize is not useful without this API.  It's
sufficiently small that everyone who wants to write UNIX-specific servers
has to know about it anyway; and if they don't want to know about those
sorts of things they ought to use the cross-platform API.

&gt;<i> *I* don't care if my server infrastructure is Debian specific.
</I>
Yes, and it's people like you that I'm trying to protect users from :-)

What additional _semantics_ does unix 'daemonize' provide that a
cross-platform startBackgroundServer() doesn't?  Do you really need the
extra 40-odd bytes of stack space for the Python frame that you're losing
by having a call-through approach rather than returning?

All it really lets you do is write servers that require a programmer to
run on Windows.  If there's no good reason for that, it's silly.

For example, although the 'process' object doesn't currently run on
Windows, its external API just relies on the notion of a process which can
be written to and read from as a file.  Once J&#252;rgen finally writes that
cgi-for-nt implementation he was talking about many months ago, I'm sure
it'll work fine on that platform ;-).

</I>
Well, I definitely support your desire for high quality.  However, what's
this about a &quot;huge apt source on tm.com&quot;?
