&gt;<i> Hmm.  It seems to work here.  What configuration are you running on?
</I>
I am running on Win98. The date on the zip file is August 21st. I don't 
have any problems running the Inheritance demo.

&gt;<i> &gt; The good news is this does not kill faucet, but results in a cute 
</I>&quot;oops, 
&gt;<i> &gt; unauthorized&quot; message. Hmm, I may look at getting that to appear as a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pop-up tk message-box.
</I>
&gt;<i> Cool :)
</I>
I am glad to say it works. You get the printed message as well as a 
tkMessageBox. I will send you (Glyph) a zip file containing the code I 
refer to in this e-mail.

&gt;<i> &gt; Am I using the wrong username and password for TRDemo or is something 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; missing somewhere else? The Inheritance demo runs okay.
</I>
&gt;<i> As I said, it works fine here.  Are you using the latest TRDemo.tar.gz 
</I>from the
&gt;<i> website?  There were a few changes... (I suppose we should be doing 
</I>versioned
&gt;<i> releases of both games, too, though so few things are changing it didn't 
</I>seem
&gt;<i> worth it)
</I>
Maybe they should be versions of the games. When I get around to writing 
one, after playing with faucet for a while, it will be kept under version 
control. How old are these games? When were they written?

&gt;<i> &gt; Is anyone currently working on the gtkfaucet? If not, then I would 
</I>like to 
&gt;<i> &gt; know if I can make changes to the core reality product. I will try 
</I>where 
&gt;<i> &gt; possible not to break the gtkfaucet functionality, but since I can't 
</I>test 
&gt;<i> &gt; it I won't make promises :) If there is someone using gtkfaucet, I 
</I>would 
&gt;<i> &gt; appreciate hearing from you to work out some arrangement when I feel I 
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; need to change or add to the existing reality scripts.
</I>
&gt;<i> Explain &quot;core reality product&quot;?  What functionality, specifically, do 
</I>you want
&gt;<i> to change?
</I>
Sorry, that's Mincom-speak coming out :) I meant the scripts in 
twisted\reality. If I change tkfaucet, gtkfaucet will still run quite 
happily. If I happen to change &quot;thing.py&quot;, then that will affect gtkfaucet 
too. I am not looking at changing anything specific right now, but as I 
get more comfortable with the code, there may be changes I wish to make. 
For example, I may implement an &quot;examine&quot; command, which is the same as 
&quot;look at&quot;, but is only one word and can be short-cut to &quot;x&quot; (see TADS).

&gt;<i> The gtkfaucet is part of our acceptance tests.  If you're going to check
</I>&gt;<i> something in to CVS that breaks those tests, you need to find a way to 
</I>test or
&gt;<i> find someone else who will test for you.  If you're not going to do 
</I>anything
&gt;<i> with CVS, feel free to send a patch!  I'll test it before I integrate it 
</I>:<i>)
</I>
I would love to be able to test gtkfaucet myself, but I do not have 
&quot;gtk.py&quot;. Is it available for Windows? If so, I would like to get a copy. 
It would make it easier to compare tkfaucet and gtkfaucet and it would 
make sure I didn't break anything.

I don't know if I would be able to access CVS from where I am, at least 
for now. If it is okay, I'd like to send patches to you. What form would 
you like the patch in?

&gt;<i> &gt; I have created DOS bat files as wrappers for building a reality tap 
</I>and 
&gt;<i> &gt; for running the tap with twistd. It contains the required commands 
</I>plus a 
&gt;<i> &gt; few house-keeping details like removing log and pid files before 
</I>running.

&gt;<i> Cool, I'd like to see those.
</I>
See zip file I will send you soon after posting this message.

&gt;<i> &gt; Currently, I have (1) modified the tkfaucet to word-wrap the 
</I>description 
&gt;<i> &gt; and item frames, (2) display them at a reasonable width and height, 
</I>(3) 

&gt;<i> Hmm.  Does 'reasonable width and height' work cross-platform?
</I>
Yes, I just meant I changed the number of characters displayed in the 
frames. The description frame is 72w x 12h, the item frame is 36w x 12h, 
and the happenings frame is 6h. This fits okay on a 800x600 screen, and 
even on a 640x480 :)

&gt;<i> &gt; added the shortcut code from gtkfaucet. I'm not entirely happy about 
</I>the 
&gt;<i> &gt; shortcuts, as I believe the &quot;go north&quot; command should have &quot;n&quot; as a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; synonym. However, I will leave it as is until I get around to looking 
</I>at 
&gt;<i> &gt; these commands.
</I>
&gt;<i> The shortcut code I'm *VERY* happy to hear about, I've been hoping that 
</I>someone
&gt;<i> would fix that for a while!  'n' is a synonym for 'go north' in 
</I>gtkfaucet, so
&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you're talking about...
</I>
See zip file I will send you soon after posting this message.

In the system I am familiar with a travel verb is defined - nVerb - whose 
verbs (synonyms) are 'n', 'north', and 'go north'. The travel verb has an 
associated action which moves the player north. This is the distinction I 
make between a synonym and a shortcut. I admit the shortcut code is small, 
neat, and efficient, so I almost certainly won't change it.

If there are other changes you wish to see made in tkfaucet, let me know 
and I will add them to my list.

&gt;<i> &gt; I don't like the idea that when you &quot;look at&quot; something, like the Colt 
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; pistol for example, your location changes to Colt pistol. That is, you 
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; have to perform a &quot;look&quot; command before you can move to another 
</I>location.

&gt;<i> Your location does not change.
</I>
&gt;<i> It changes your _focus_, the object you're looking at.  The &quot;obvious 
</I>exits&quot;
&gt;<i> thing is sort of broken, and I apologise for that.  However, you do not 
</I>need to
&gt;<i> issue another 'look' command before you can move.
</I>
I tried that last night and it works as you said. I think the next thing I 
will look at is the 'Obvious Exits' code. I like this feature. In a TADS 
game, I would implement a verb called &quot;exits&quot; which would display the 
exits the player knows about.

&gt;<i> &gt; This is all I have to report at the moment. I would have had more but 
</I>I 
&gt;<i> &gt; got side-tracked playing the IF game Moist (written in TADS). Now 
</I>*that* 
&gt;<i> &gt; would have some interesting possibilities in a multi-player 
</I>environment :)

&gt;<i> Wonderful!  It's good to hear a report of any progress at all, so don't 
</I>feel
&gt;<i> bad!  Also, don't consider playing IF a waste of time.  It's &quot;market 
</I>research&quot;.
&gt;<i> :-)
</I>
