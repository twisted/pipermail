Itamar,

Sorry for neglecting this thread safety stuff, but I've been very busy
with other changes (which, somewhat ironically, will need to be thread
safe).  I should have given you the go-ahead to fix it completely much
earlier.

I assume you're talking about connectionLost, and yes, it's misleading and
wrong.  It should never be called from user code, and always happen in the
main thread.

I apologize for the state of the threading code; as you can probably tell,
it was written when I was fresh from Java and still recursive-mutex happy.  
Please integrate your changes when it's next convenient, including the
removal of any synchronization that you find inappropriate, and
alternative implementations of various currently-synchronized classes.  I
recommend you take a look at threadable.dispatchOS as well... it could
probably use the threadtask mechanism.

If you're feeling _especially_ generous, feel free to write a document
entitled &quot;threaded programming with twisted&quot; that gives a nice overview of
what's appropriate to use threads for, and what things they can and can't
do using your thread safety scheme :-).
