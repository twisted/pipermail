Yeah, I noticed that, but left it out for the first pass as it wasn't
necessary to get the network connection up and running...

&gt;<i> &gt; Service (twisted.spread.pb.Service)

</I>
That sounds like an excellent idea.  However, it's an area I remain
entirely ignorant of...

&gt;<i> &gt; Perspective (twisted.spread.pb.Perspective)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also don't talk so much about &quot;client&quot; and &quot;server&quot; when referring to the
</I>&gt;<i> perspective; this is objects-to-objects.
</I>
Well, I've got to have some terms other than &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; to keep
straight what I'm talking about.  Would you rather I called them &quot;Alice&quot;
and &quot;Bob&quot;?

Besides, if we are talking about this in the context of Services, (which
we are, as that text isn't general enough to be used as all-purpose
docstrings) I would think it makes sense to refer to one side as a
server, does it not?

&gt;<i> &gt; Note: Since all commands over the broker happen asynchronously, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; client cannot receive return values from a perspective_foo() method.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes it can, actually.  If you pass a keyword parameter 'pbcallback', that
</I>&gt;<i> callback will be invoked on the client when the return value is
</I>&gt;<i> received.  
</I>
And &quot;The callback will be called with a single argument, the return
value.&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt; How does error notification work?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Similiarly to return-value notification.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   myReference.do(arg,arg,pbcallback=myCallback, pberrback=myErrorCallback)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All you get as an argument to the error callback is is a traceback or
</I>&gt;<i> error message string though.
</I>
This means including the pberrback parameter on every call?  What
happens if you don't?  Is there a catch-all error handler you can set?
Why the sometimes strings/sometimes traceback inconsistancy?

&gt;<i> &gt; What naming conventions should application authors use?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just stick to the Twisted coding standard and you'll be fine.
</I>
CodingStandard.html does not have the adverb prefixes like perspective_,
remote_, etc.

&gt;<i> Cached is interesting, but complex and you'll know if you need it.  
</I>
Yeah, &quot;&quot;&quot;It's like a Copy, but way, *WAY* worse!&quot;&quot;&quot;

&gt;<i> I'd highly encourage you to write some code though :)
</I>
ah'm workin on that =)
