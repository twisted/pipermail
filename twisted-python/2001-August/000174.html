<PRE>Ok, my mind is shutting down, but I want to throw something at the list
tonight so I don't forget what I was thinking on.

Now, I know you've put a lot of effort into naming things so you can say
&quot;it is what it says it is&quot;, but no matter how common you think the words
you use are, there's going to be *someone* who isn't familiar.  That's
why I was trying to give a non-circular definition of &quot;Service&quot; the
other day.

And today, The Word Of The Day is: Serializable!

It might even be kinda a real word, but it's sure not one in my
vocabulary.  So while it appears that the docstring for Perspective goes
to great length to make a very reasoned explanation, I'm having a
difficult time deciphering it.

twisted.spread.pb.Perspective.__doc__ reads:
&gt;<i> A perspective on a service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I want to it to be *possible* to be able to call remote methods on
</I>&gt;<i> this.  I also want it to *normally* be serialized as a Proxy, becuase
</I>&gt;<i> if users want references to each other they've got to be able to see
</I>&gt;<i> each others' perspective.  (I can *see* your perspective, but I can't
</I>&gt;<i> see *from* your perspective.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So why does it have to be referenced?  It just has to implement
</I>&gt;<i> remoteMessageReceived.  In fact, it should not implement remote_; it
</I>&gt;<i> should implement perspective_ or somesuch.  Normally, they're not
</I>&gt;<i> serializable anwyay!
</I>
See, I *think* that answers the question I was going to ask, &quot;How is a
Perspective different than a Referenced object,&quot; but I don't know how to
read it.  In addition to uncomprehension through non-deep-grokking of
the lingo, the phrase &quot;I can *see* your perspective, but I can't see
*from* your perspective,&quot; is a riddle I can't say I have, uh, untwisted.

Ok, hopefully that's enough to get you talking a bit.  I'm going to go
have myself a sleep.

...the thing about writing code is, some of us have to understand what
tools and components are available to us *before* we can do so.  ;)
