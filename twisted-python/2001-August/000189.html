<PRE>From: &quot;M.J. Stahl&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">mjmstahl at one.net</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> I would like to work towards developing Reality into a more mature
</I>&gt;<i> environment, but (laughably) I am having trouble even getting the
</I>&gt;<i> environment started (ie, I am recieving a traceback).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can someone please give me a general breakdown on getting TRDemo or
</I>&gt;<i> Inheritance started.
</I>
I got Inheritance running, eventually, under Windows 98. If you'd like the
details of how, I will post them tomorrow as it is my home machine. I am at
work now, so I will most likely post in another 24 hours. I am in Australia
(GMT +1000). The Inheritance demo lets you go to lots of places which need a
description :) but entry of verbs is not available yet.

I couldn't get TRDemo going at all because it was looking for module
&quot;library.box&quot;, which did not come with 0.9.3.

This is the area that got me interested in Twisted in the first place.

Good luck with your efforts.

Cheers,
ChrisH
