No it isn't. It's offering *just* the daemonize functionality. You
can have a higher-level wrapper *on top* of that which is portable,
but daemonize() is useful.

&gt;<i> After all, this is about as platform specific as you get.
</I>
Yes it is. I firmly believe in platform-specific APIs which are then
wrapped in platform independent APIs. I don't want anything to restrict
my access to the OS

&gt;<i> If we have
</I>&gt;<i> daemonize, then we probably want to have a similiar function for starting
</I>&gt;<i> a Windows Service.
</I>
Yes, it would. This isn't an argument against daemonize.

&gt;<i> Moreover, it would be good if we could detect which
</I>&gt;<i> platform we're on, then do the appropriate thing for creating a daemon on
</I>&gt;<i> that platform.
</I>
Agreed.
But not with daemonize() -- with startService(....) which would call
daemonize() on UNIX.

&gt;<i> This implies logging.  &quot;daemonize&quot; won't work if you're still writing to
</I>&gt;<i> standard output after you call it.
</I>
Well, it closes FD 1, so it works well enough for that.
Logging is left for a higher level API. As is writing PID files (which
must be done after daemonizing but before getting into the main loop)

&gt;<i> So I'd say daemonize should at least take a logfile, and a function +
</I>&gt;<i> varargs, and never return.
</I>
No, that's startService, another useful API. 

&gt;<i> This sounds cool, with one minor caveat.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to give windows users the impression that they're totally
</I>&gt;<i> unsupported, especially any more than they already are.
</I>
Fine, support them ;-)

&gt;<i> We should make plans to have similiar windows-ize scripts, and even if we
</I>&gt;<i> don't have them, make it clear that we're not trying to make a
</I>&gt;<i> debian-specific server infrastructure.
</I>
*I* don't care if my server infrastructure is Debian specific.

&gt;<i> Also, wouldn't this &quot;debian&quot; functionality be very similiar for redhat,
</I>&gt;<i> mandrake, etc?  Even solaris and MacOS X?  &quot;unixize&quot; might be a better
</I>&gt;<i> name for it.
</I>
No. Debian uses .deb packages. Maybe whoever does RPM chooses to redhatize
or rpmize (I'm not sure: would she support SuSE? Mandrake?) Solaris
uses its own unique wonderful format, as does MacOS X and AIX.
I would be happy to put my /etc/init.d/ templates where everyone can use
them. Everything else is distribution specific. It's not hard to have
a hand install of a .tap if you have the /etc/init.d template.

I want the Debian packages to be good enough that I'll feel good enough
about uploading them to the official Debian archive, as well as maintainig
a huge apt source on tm.com.
