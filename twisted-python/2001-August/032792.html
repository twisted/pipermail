<PRE>I downloaded the TRDemo zip file yesterday and everything works okay 
now...

I have identified three problems I will look at as time permits

(1) 'pull string' of the John Romero action figure results in the 
broadcast messages appearing twice. Calls to broadcastToPair() appear but 
calls to broadcast() do not. I don't know why. I changed the function so 
the John Romero messages actually appear now. I don't know why broadcast() 
won't work from the 'pull string' function.

(2) obvious exits should always show the obvious exits from the player's 
room even when you are looking at an object. Glyph mentioned this 
yesterday.

(3) add an 'examine' verb, which is the same as 'look at'. I want to use 
'x' as a short-cut for examine, but the code for direction short-cuts 
won't work in this case - direction short-cuts replace the whole sentence 
with the full command.

If ANYONE has problems with tkfaucet, please add them to the list and I 
will see what I can do about fixing them.

Cheers,
ChrisH
