I'm willing to compromise on the stdout issue.
The loop issue isn't about stack space - it's about doing stuff between
the daemonizing and the looping without writing another function.
The classical example is 

daemonize(logfile)
open(pidfile, 'w').write(str(os.getpid()))
app.run()
 
&gt;<i> Yes.  And it should be strongly deprecated to call daemonize directly.
</I>
Why? Even if I'm writing something UNIX specific?

&gt;<i> I would argue that daemonize is not useful without this API.  
</I>
And that would be akin to argue that fork() is not useful without
spawn(). The fork/exec in UNIX has been shown to be very powerful.

&gt;<i> It's
</I>&gt;<i> sufficiently small that everyone who wants to write UNIX-specific servers
</I>&gt;<i> has to know about it anyway; and if they don't want to know about those
</I>&gt;<i> sorts of things they ought to use the cross-platform API.
</I>
But knowing and &quot;writing it 10 times&quot; is different.
Especially, &quot;and the 8th time, use stdout.close() instead of os.close(1)&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt; *I* don't care if my server infrastructure is Debian specific.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and it's people like you that I'm trying to protect users from :-)
</I>
I'm not writing unportable code intentionally. I just don't care
about more portability which degrades quality. Like not using
fork() because it's not portable.

That sentence was written about why I want a --debianize option to 
mktap. You took it out of context.

&gt;<i> All it really lets you do is write servers that require a programmer to
</I>&gt;<i> run on Windows.  If there's no good reason for that, it's silly.
</I>
It lets me have convenience in return for portability to a system 
nobody I really care about runs.

&gt;<i> For example, although the 'process' object doesn't currently run on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows, its external API just relies on the notion of a process which can
</I>&gt;<i> be written to and read from as a file.  Once J=FCrgen finally writes that
</I>&gt;<i> cgi-for-nt implementation he was talking about many months ago, I'm sure
</I>&gt;<i> it'll work fine on that platform ;-).
</I>
Sure, and that's a great abstraction -- for those who want to use it.
You would not argue that this means that twisted programs cannot use
fork(), right?

&gt;<i> Well, I definitely support your desire for high quality.  However, what's
</I>&gt;<i> this about a &quot;huge apt source on tm.com&quot;?
</I>
PArtly a joke, partly a vision for a world where everybody uploads
packages into tm.com/apt, and then just

&quot;apt-get install integrated-web-and-mail-server&quot;

will work.
