Thanks for writing these up, Itamar!  This sort of reflection is rare and it's always helpful :).

&gt;<i> 1. Callbacks should be sync or async, but never

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.ometer.com/2011/07/24/callbacks-synchronous-and-asynchronous/.">http://blog.ometer.com/2011/07/24/callbacks-synchronous-and-asynchronous/.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, Deferred.addCallback(f) really should never run f()
</I>&gt;<i> immediately.
</I>
This has come up a lot in a compare-and-contrast of Twisted vs. asyncio.

I agree that the problems with synchronous callbacks are not insignificant (reentrancy is a degenerate form of preemption, and as we all know preemption is the corrupt wellspring of all bugs).  However, the benefit, i.e. consistency of behavior with respect to reentrancy, comes with a cost: tight coupling to an event loop.  In asyncio, Future's tight coupling to call_soon is a source of problems; it makes it hard to write a test without setting up an elaborate scheduling trampoline, whereas successResultOf/failureResultOf are quite simple to work with.

I think Deferred as it is today is a pretty good compromise between the two positions.  On the one hand it is decoupled from the event loop.  On the other - and this is important - no Deferred-returning API will ever call your callbacks synchronously.  Deferred.addCallback will, of course, but savvy Twisted programmers can (and should) do this, if they have dependent state changes:

self.manipulateSomeStateForSetup()
d = doSomethingPotentiallySynchronous()
self.manipulateSomeStateForProcessing()
d.addCallback(completeOperation)

As a caller, you can always decide whether you can safely be re-entered or not.  In most cases, simply moving the 'addCallback' to the end of the function (a-la Go's &quot;defer&quot;, oddly enough) is fine.  In more complex cases where you really need to unwind reentrancy completely, you can do your own callLater(0) or callFromThread() from an object with a reference to a reactor.

&gt;<i> 3.
</I>
What happened to '2'? :)

&gt;<i> By instrumenting all callbacks it manages, which may or may not
</I>&gt;<i> require item #1, Twisted can have a context that automatically follows
</I>&gt;<i> callbacks. Node has this and it is extremely useful.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://fredkschott.com/post/2014/02/conquering-asynchronous-context-with-cls/">http://fredkschott.com/post/2014/02/conquering-asynchronous-context-with-cls/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> is best summary I've found with a bit of searching.
</I>
This was _always_ supposed to be the way that Twisted worked, but frankly I just wasn't smart enough to figure it out.  This is why twisted.python.context came to exist in the first place; I always wanted to attach it to Deferred somehow.  I will watch this talk intently; if #1 really is required to address this, my opinion might change.  A PR would be intensely appreciated.
