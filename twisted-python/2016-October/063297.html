We already have this problem, and we will need to do a doc cleanup / consolidation / deprecation pass soon.  (see: tcp, tcp6, host, ssl, tls...)

&gt;<i>     b) They change incompatibility, defeating the purpose of trying to maintain backwards compatability.
</I>
As you've noticed, we may have several potential &quot;outs&quot; to have practically-compatible parsing syntaxes; the real problem is the internal factoring of the parsing APIs rather than the syntax.

&gt;<i> 2) As user, I need to learn which endpoints support the new syntax, thus potentially needing to know both methods of quoting and switch between them as appropriate.
</I>
As a user you're going to need to read the parameter documentation anyway; learning about new syntax is not much different than learning about a new parameter.  And you may not realize there _is_ a syntax; most configuration of this type is just copying and pasting a reasonable-looking example.  Not to say that we should be spuriously incompatible for those who have learned the rules, but the only rule to learn at this point is &quot;: separates arguments, \ escapes :&quot;.  We could add one more rule without unduly stressing the cognitive burden of the endpoint system.

&gt;<i> There are a couple of possible ways around this, without requiring a weird hack.
</I>&gt;<i> - I wonder how many endpoints strings have ever been written whose value starts with any of `[` `(` or `{`? I suspect that the number might in fact be 0. In which case, although the change is technically incompatible, in practice it wouldn't be.
</I>&gt;<i> - Alternatively, we could deprecate an unquoted [, (, { at the beginning of a value, and then after a suitable deprecation period (perhaps additionally a release where it is just an error), we could repurpose one of them to act as quoting (leaving the other two for future extensiblity).
</I>
I suspect that this would be overkill here; we also have other options, like '(: :)', which would be totally compatible (there are no _arguments_ anywhere presently named &quot;(&quot;).
