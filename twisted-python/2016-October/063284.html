Services are just things that can be started and stopped.  Application is just a top-level object that associates a thing-to-start with a few bits of global process-level state, like logging and pidfile settings.

Therefore, the Service hierarchy abstraction is a poor fit for some code that needs to do some work and then exit; it's designed for long-running tools which can be started and stopped on demand.  For example, what happens if two Service objects think that the Application's job is &quot;done&quot;?

If you want to exit a process, calling `stop` on the reactor is generally the right way to go.

But: talking about this in such vague, abstract terms is unlikely to be helpful.  What, concretely, are you actually trying to do with the &quot;Services in a variety of Applications&quot;?
