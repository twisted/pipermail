</I>
Maybe this was my conceptual issue; the parallels were close enough
that it just felt right to add the functionality to Twisted's Service
Hierarchy - close enough that I was sucked into thoughts of
modbusPollingClient IS-A Service... but keeping in mind the arguments
of composition vs inheritance, I somehow finished up with
modbusClientService HAS-A pollingLogic - whereas what I think you are
recommending here is that that pollingLogic HAS-A modbusClientService
and knows about a MultiService which it makes use of only to let the
Application have overall control over starting and stopping all the
active Services.

Actually I just read this back through and am not sure this is
actually really what you meant Glyph :-/
I do get that it seems I am grabbing the stick by the wrong end, I
guess I'll just go back to reading more example code to see if I can
find something that resonates with me as being close to what I'm
trying to achieve.

&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> When it's time to &quot;stop&quot; a service, do setServiceParent(None); when it's
</I>&gt;<i> time to &quot;start&quot; it, do setServiceParent(appropriateServiceParent).  This
</I>&gt;<i> should take care of keeping your services in the appropriate state.
</I>
I have to admit I had not even thought of using setServiceParent(None)
to bring services down - looking at the source makes this concept
clearer and potentially useful to me though

&gt;<i> BTW, if you have stateful long-running services that have to self-modify
</I>&gt;<i> based on changing circumstances, you might want to also check out
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/glyph/automat">https://github.com/glyph/automat</A> to see if it can help you ensure that
</I>&gt;<i> everything's in a consistent state.
</I>
I'm still really just prototyping at this stage, trying to find an
architecture that fits what I believe should be quite a simple
application that is reasonably well suited to Twisted, but once I've
passed this stage if I do find myself needing a FSM that is beyond
totally simple then I'll certainly give this a look. Thanks.
