</I>&gt;<i> &gt; making such aggressive use of private APIs that it could win a contest about how to ensure that you break on every new release of Twisted :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We're very aware of that! It's one of the reasons we have the test matrix set up to run multiple versions of Python and Twisted. I have not started on 16.X compatibility yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;  I imagine that it's a non-trivial impact to performance, so it would be worthwhile to track that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We put this this through some extensive benchmarks and testing to measure the performance impact. For example, the details are logged in a commit message but, we initially implemented the @inlineCallbacks extension as a coroutine wrapper. However, we found that the way t.p.Failure tries to serialize itself, and its local+global scopes, to a dictionary caused enormous memory and CPU consumption when triggered because of the added objects in those spaces. The negative impact grew exponentially with levels of nested coroutines. Very bad day.
</I>
What are you referring to as a &quot;coroutine&quot; here?  A generator?  And exponential growth, you say?  That sounds very surprising.

&gt;<i> Once we pivoted to a small fork of @inlineCallbacks, we measured the overall performance hit to be negligible in our services. I'll dig around to see if I can find where we documented the actual numbers we saw. At a macro level, our service wide stats showed no meaningful growth of runtime or memory consumption.
</I>
Does this mean you only get context tracking against inlineCallbacks, and not other usages of Deferred?

&gt;<i> &gt; digression on &quot;Don't Switch In The Core&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was surprised at how much switching this context implementation was when we put it in the lower level read/write callbacks. Each of our services process a large amount of continually streaming data and our profiles show, IIRC, that one of the top 5 consumers of CPU time was calling the read/write callbacks. When we added this to those paths it increased overall CPU usage by double digit percentage points. If this feature were available as an opt-in reactor extension then providers could capacity plan around the performance hit. We found it more valuable to move the switching closer to application protocol code where switches happen less frequently.
</I>
Maybe &quot;switching&quot; is more expensive than I realized.  Where is this implemented?

&gt;<i>   &gt; I also take it from the performance notes that you're not using PyPy?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We're still on cPython. PyPy is something we've talked about before but haven't invested much time into yet. I don't know to what extent PyPy might change the performance characteristics of the project.
</I>
As I always tell people - if you care about performance, PyPy should be step zero.  Optimizing for CPython looks like adding weird implementation-specific hacks that might start working or be backwards in the next version; optimizing for PyPy means making the code simpler and more readable so the JIT can figure out what to do ;).  So the pressure that optimizing for PyPy exerts on your code is generally a lot healthier.
