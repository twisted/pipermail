Hi Victor,

This should be pretty easy to accomplish; this kind of thing is generally very straightforward using Twisted.  Obviously you'd have to implement a protocol for talking to Gamin, but I think the protocol involved is well-documented and very straightforward.

However, you should be aware that Solaris 10 is not currently a supported platform.  You can see the list of supported platforms along the left-hand side of this page: &lt;<A HREF="http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/boxes-supported">http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/boxes-supported</A>&gt;.

The primary impediment to supporting Solaris is the lack of a buildbot that can tell us whether it works or not.  We don't even have an unsupported Solaris builder (see &lt;<A HREF="http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/boxes-all">http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/boxes-all</A>&gt; for all the currently running buildbots, including those which are known to fail).

Most likely, Twisted will work just fine on Solaris, since it's quite a lot like a lot of other platforms we do support, and especially we've recently improved support for various less popular UNIXes like the *BSD family.

Contributing a buildbot to Twisted is pretty easy though, and we can probably even supply the hardware for you (assuming that Solaris 10 can run happily in an x86[_64] qemu/kvm-style VM) if you'd just volunteer to install the OS and make sure it's configured properly.

Do you have any interest in helping us make Solaris a supported platform?

Thanks,

-glyph
