I think this makes sense: applications that are still gaining new 
features should be on Python 3 by now. For applications on Python 2 the 
main concern would be to keep them running while the world around them 
updates (new OS versions etc).

Python 2.7 support will end early 2020. In my opinion it is unnecessary 
to support Twisted on Python 2.7 for longer than Python 2.7 itself is 
supported. So all of the proposed timelines are generous, in my opinion.

Bye,
