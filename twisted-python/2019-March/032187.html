<PRE>I have been switching matrix.org to Buildkite's open source offering (where
you bring your own builders). It might be an option for things like
codespeed, which we still would want to be consistent.

Other than that, I was taking a look at Azure Pipelines last year. I think
we could get a decent amount of hosted, easy to maintain build
infrastructure through Microsoft, which includes the potential to also
ditch running our own Windows for testing.

&gt;<i> Thanks to our long-suffering contributors Adi Roiban and Kyle Altendorf,
</I>&gt;<i> we now have macOS builds running on circleCI!  Supposedly we have
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient resources to actually run all our builds, too, without running
</I>&gt;<i> out of CI juice before the end of each month :-).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As such, I've changed our repository configuration to drop the old,
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat outdated macOS buildbot, and replace it with the Circle CI
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure which should cover that platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With this change, none of the buildbot builders define our gating-to-trunk
</I>&gt;<i> continuous integration.  This is a great thing for the project, as it means
</I>&gt;<i> external contributors will be able to get a &quot;this is acceptable to merge&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> green checkmark without ./admin/pr_as_branch or any other similar
</I>&gt;<i> repo:write-person-requiring shenanigans.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, it also means that we are now spending a not-insignificant amount
</I>&gt;<i> of contributor time maintaining a farm of machines that do tons of
</I>&gt;<i> continuous integration work, which may not really be telling us anything
</I>&gt;<i> interesting about Twisted's quality or correctness.  I think it might be
</I>&gt;<i> worth considering decommissioning buildbot.twistedmatrix.com entirely,
</I>&gt;<i> unless some of the vendors of the platforms and kernels covered there would
</I>&gt;<i> like to step up to do some maintenance themselves.  It's been a decade or
</I>&gt;<i> so since Twisted was spotting regular regressions in Linux, FreeBSD or
</I>&gt;<i> Darwin, so I think this style of build infrastructure may be a relic of a
</I>&gt;<i> bygone era.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For my part, I probably will start doing any contributions on my own fork,
</I>&gt;<i> since that will mean I don't have to constantly kick random spurious RHEL7
</I>&gt;<i> buildbot failures to avoid getting a red &quot;X&quot; on my PRs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, if we decom'd buildbot as software infrastructure, we'd still
</I>&gt;<i> have a significant amount of cloud / hardware resources we could
</I>&gt;<i> potentially throw at *other* problems facing the project which cloud CI
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't cover as well, like SpeedCenter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, do folks have any strong feelings, or would anyone like to volunteer
</I>&gt;<i> to help with some aspect of this?  As always: we don't have enough folks to
</I>&gt;<i> keep up with the operational demands of twistedmatrix.com, so if you want
</I>&gt;<i> to dev some ops or ops some infra, please speak up :).
