<PRE>Hello community,

 

First of all - thanks for an awesome platform!  I'm brand new to this
community, but have been using Twisted a couple years.

 

Reason for posting:

I've hit a condition with ReconnectingClientFactory that I'm not sure is per
design.  I have a work around right now, but need your perspective.  Seems
like there should be a better/right way to do this.

 

Attempted design:

I'd like to have long running TCP clients (forever until stopped), with a
long running TCP server.  When a long running client hits a problem with a
dependency (database is down, kafka bus unavailable, external API not
responding, etc), I want the client to go offline for a while and then come
back online. an automated, self-recovery type action.  Since it's not ok to
start/stop/restart the Twisted Reactor, I am letting the client finish
whatever it can do, disconnect from the service, destruct the dependencies,
wait for a period of time, and then attempt a clean re-initialization of
those dependencies along with reconnecting to the Twisted Server.

 

Problem case:

I'm using the ReconnectingClientFactory in my client.  When the client hits
a problem, it calls transport.loseConnection().  But whenever the client
calls this, after the disconnect - it does not reconnect; stopFactory is
called and everything exits. 

 

Work around:

I noticed some Twisted source code that works off factory.numPorts.  If
numPorts is 1 and the client loses the connection, it goes to 0 and calls
the cleanup.  So I conditionally increase this number right before
intentionally disconnecting, and then reset that after reconnecting.  This
solves the problem, but it's a hack.  

 

I'll attach the test scripts to this post (if attachments are allowed), but
the main code is with these functions in the factory:

 

                def clientConnectionLost(self, connector, reason):

                                print('  factory clientConnectionLost:
reason: {}'.format(reason))

                                # if self.disconnectedOnPurpose:

                                #             ## Hack to keep reactor alive

                                #             print('  factory
clientConnectionLost: increasing numPorts')

                                #             self.numPorts += 1

                                #             self.numPortsChanged = True

                                #             self.disconnectedOnPurpose =
False

                                print('  ... simulate client going idle
before attempting restart...')

                                time.sleep(5)

 
ReconnectingClientFactory.clientConnectionLost(self, connector, reason)

                                print('  factory clientConnectionLost:
end.\n')

 

                def clientConnectionMade(self):

                                print('  factory clientConnectionMade:
starting numPorts: {}'.format(self.numPorts))

                                # if self.numPortsChanged :

                                #             ## Resetting from hacked value

                                #             print('  factory
clientConnectionMade: decreasing numPorts')

                                #             self.numPorts -= 1

                                #             self.numPortsChanged = False

                                print('  factory clientConnectionMade:
finished numPorts: {}'.format(self.numPorts))

 

                def cleanup(self):

                                print('factory cleanup: calling
loseConnection')

                                if self.connectedClient is not None:

 
self.connectedClient.transport.loseConnection()

                                                self.disconnectedOnPurpose =
True

 

With the above lines commented out, once the cleanup call does
transport.loseConnection(), the factory stops at the end of
clientConnectionLost. 

 

 

Sample scripts/logs:

I've tried to create short test scripts and corresponding logs (with the
client failing, and then with it restarting when I use the workaround).
I've cut out several thousand lines to get down to something simple for the
example test scripts, but I know the client is still a little long.  Again,
I'm not sure if attachments work on the mailing list, but I'll attempt to
attach the client/server scripts with the corresponding pass/fail logs.

 

Thanks!

 

-Chris
