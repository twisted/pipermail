<PRE>Hi!

Figured it might be helpful to just throw in the other viewpoint (that I'd
hold).

Which is -- I use a Python 2.7 [PyPy] not end of lifing in 2020 (or in the
forseeable future -- and one by the way I'd wholeheartedly have recommended
more of us use even before now :). At work, we develop even new
applications on it, and likely will not have any plans to move anything
really until at least a year or two, until PyPy3 matures and until we have
time to do extensive benchmarking showing it isn't slower than PyPy2.

So my personal opinion would be obviously &quot;drop Py2 support immediately&quot; --
nope kidding, just making sure you're still reading -- it's &quot;keep it
forever and we all suffer, hooray&quot;.

I don't contribute to Twisted as much as I'd like (or should), and I fully
recognize the huge efforts of others who hey shouldn't do free work just on
my behalf -- but, in case it's valuable, FWIW dropping Py2 support would
make me *less* likely to contribute :), since I couldn't rely on being able
to use my own contributions -- perhaps though a decent solution to this
side of things is for twisted to continue to pursue being more modular than
it is today (i.e. break it up).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since the Python 2 EOL date is rapidly approaching, I thought it was
</I>&gt;<i> time we consider dropping Python 2 support.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I personally find that Python 2 compat adds a huge amount of overhead
</I>&gt;<i> when working on and maintaining Twisted, and think that with the current
</I>&gt;<i> maintainer availability, dropping it sooner rather than later would have a
</I>&gt;<i> beneficial effect on how much work we spend on shims/compat, complexity,
</I>&gt;<i> and our ability to ship new features, as well as onboarding people who are
</I>&gt;<i> interested in the project, but have no interest (or experience!) in Python
</I>&gt;<i> 2.7.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Personally, I don't have this problem, but I'm certainly willing to
</I>&gt;<i> believe it's a bigger deal for others; especially others who perhaps have
</I>&gt;<i> not even learned Python 2 at this point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am still using python 2.7 on all my projects, and I remember the
</I>&gt;<i> sending patches supporting python 3 was an extra effort... I had to
</I>&gt;<i> learn python 3 things, and then search for ways / workaround to
</I>&gt;<i> implement something in a py2 + py3 way... read six documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess that many Twisted developers don't have too much free time,
</I>&gt;<i> this can add up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For me learning py3 was ok as at some point I will use it...but I
</I>&gt;<i> guess that for people who will never use py2 is just unwanted work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here's my question about this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Who will do this work?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Personally, I'm not willing to commit to this.  I know from experience
</I>&gt;<i> both on Twisted and other projects that maintaining multiple release
</I>&gt;<i> branches, even one that's &quot;maintenance only&quot;, requires at least one
</I>&gt;<i> point-person for each branch at all times (usually a &quot;release manager&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> And backporting fixes inevitably gets harder and harder as the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;maintenance&quot; branch diverges from top-of-tree.  If I have time to work on
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted in my increasingly scarce spare time, I want it to be on something
</I>&gt;<i> at least plausibly interesting, and manually backporting manual fixes to an
</I>&gt;<i> unmaintained py2 branch that I don't even use doesn't qualify.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> [SNIP]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do we have py2-only users who are willing to take ownership of this
</I>&gt;<i> branch?  Specific people willing to sign up for this responsibility for the
</I>&gt;<i> next... how long?  Three years?  Five years?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can help with backporting security fixed for the next 5 years, as I
</I>&gt;<i> will use it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am still using 15.5 due to lack of python cryptography on all
</I>&gt;<i> systems, and I have a fork for twisted.web with support for resources
</I>&gt;<i> which can add custom `Expect: 100-continue` behaviour.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am doing backporting and as long as there is a CI, is not that hard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope there will be at least another person to help reviewing the
</I>&gt;<i> backports.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I'd rather be quite explicit that while we would not object to anyone
</I>&gt;<i> filling these roles, someone still needs to step forward and fill them, and
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not willing to commit the current team, such as it is, to work that I
</I>&gt;<i> myself am unwilling to do.  If nobody does step forward we should not claim
</I>&gt;<i> to have security support for a dead / unmaintained branch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well.. this is free/libre software so I guess that nobody will be sued
</I>&gt;<i> if we commit to something, and later we found out that this can't be
</I>&gt;<i> done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One of my rationales is that from some analysis of PyPI download
</I>&gt;<i> statistics, the vast majority of Python 2 users are using old versions of
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted, while nearly all our Python 3 users are on the latest version. As
</I>&gt;<i> such, I believe freezing a version that will get security updates but no
</I>&gt;<i> new features would not be a massive loss to those stuck on Python 2 for
</I>&gt;<i> whatever reason.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know that you detailed some of this on IRC, but: how old?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My sense would be that of course users stuck on py2 would have a more
</I>&gt;<i> conservative upgrade cadence than py3 users, but that doesn't mean they
</I>&gt;<i> never upgrade.  How far behind are these py2 users, and does the curve
</I>&gt;<i> suggest they're catching up or are most twisted downloads just like,
</I>&gt;<i> version 1.3 on python 1.5.2 forever?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From my experience the upgrade is between 5 to 10 years.
</I>&gt;<i> But the upgrade is done only because the system will be obsolete.
</I>&gt;<i> Old version run in private networks, without Internet access with
</I>&gt;<i> nobody willing to touch a working system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PCI don't help. So far, they have only asked for TLS1.2 and removal of
</I>&gt;<i> CBC Mode ciphers in SSH...and that is all.
</I>&gt;<i> They have never complained about old OpenSSH or OpenSSL versions...
</I>&gt;<i> and when you have custom old software, the PCI auditor have no clue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know more than 3 big companies which still have not upgraded to TLS
</I>&gt;<i> 1.2 even with all the PCI audits...they always get extensions and
</I>&gt;<i> workarounds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Twisted's compatibility policy would still apply, ensuring that Python
</I>&gt;<i> 2/3 compatible software using Twisted would be able to use the older
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted version on Python 2, and the newer version on Python 3, as you
</I>&gt;<i> would usually expect.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We have 2 big blockers here right now that would prevent doing this as
</I>&gt;<i> things stand right now:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Twisted is not yet fully ported to Python 3, so there's no version where
</I>&gt;<i> you can use all of Twisted on Python 3.  This picture is way, way smaller
</I>&gt;<i> than it has ever been, though - grab a module and start porting:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.habnab.it/twisted-depgraph/">http://blog.habnab.it/twisted-depgraph/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We still have Python 2 in production ourselves that requires Twisted;
</I>&gt;<i> specifically:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Trac and several of our ancillary utilities around it.  Happily this
</I>&gt;<i> does seem to be fairly actively worked on: &quot;opened 4 years ago, last
</I>&gt;<i> modified 12 days ago&quot; <A HREF="https://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/12130">https://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/12130</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do we really need Trac?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe is time to move the tickets and wiki to GitHub.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dogfood DNS: twisted.names doesn't work on python 3:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9496">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9496</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have never used Twisted.names in production.
</I>&gt;<i> I tried to help with the review of twisted.names patches, and I
</I>&gt;<i> remember there was not much interest for twisted.names
</I>&gt;<i> So maybe we can get rid of it and move it to a separate project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that we need to have everything in twisted core... if
</I>&gt;<i> ldaptor is an external project, why we can't have twisted.names
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Our front-end webserver might work on pypy3, but we have yet to move it
</I>&gt;<i> over.  Maybe that would be a good place to start?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If this proposal lights a fire under some folks to drive any of these
</I>&gt;<i> projects to completion, that would be great!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My hope is that this proposal will light a fire and people using
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted will more about Twisted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel that Twisted stability and reduce number of defects is not
</I>&gt;<i> helping the open source dev model.
</I>&gt;<i> People will use Twisted, it just work and they forget about it.
</I>&gt;<i> Or if it doesn't work, they can fix something on their project
</I>&gt;<i> relatively easy...but takes a lot of effort to send upstream..so they
</I>&gt;<i> will never put the effort required to have a fix upstream.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can find the proposal here, in this handy-dandy Google Doc:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S4CGgZC09blLIdk3Zo7wBa75A9_JuuH_3akkyjN0lik/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S4CGgZC09blLIdk3Zo7wBa75A9_JuuH_3akkyjN0lik/edit</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Comments are welcome, as well as which timeline seems reasonable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Personally I feel like Option 1 is the most reasonable.  We can't do
</I>&gt;<i> option 3 because of the above blockers, and option 2 just seems random to
</I>&gt;<i> me - why commit to 4 months of additional maintenance beyond when py2
</I>&gt;<i> itself is EOL?  Maybe there's an option like, 1.5, where we de-support py2
</I>&gt;<i> at max(2020-01-01, &quot;the date at which we no longer have any py2 code in

</I>&gt;<i> I think that things will be better for everyone if for example of

</I>&gt;<i> use more Software as a Service so that the team will spend more time
