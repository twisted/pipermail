</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But since AMP v2 is experimental, I think that is best to have it as a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So my take is to revert it and move it to twisted/txamp2.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have no issue with changing the name or if this patch lives as a

</I>&gt;<i> The main thing I dislike about netstrings are the variable-length ASCII
</I>&gt;<i> numbers, but that is not a big complexity.
</I>
I originally didn't like this either, but since I designed AMP I've come around:

The thing about variable-length ASCII numbers is that they give you a lot of leeway to error out in case the protocol is not being respected.  With packed binary values, any 2-byte sequence is a valid length, so if something opens a socket and says &quot;EHLO&quot;, it starts waiting for 17734 more bytes which it will never receive.  By contrast, netstrings have built-in redudancy; for a very low overhead (most length prefixes end up being 2-3 bytes rather than 2) you get the ability to immediately error out with a clear exception as soon as you see &quot;E&quot;.  Anyone implementing this in a static context where they don't want heap allocations for the length prefix itself should not allocate arbitrary data, but rather, allocate a very small fixed buffer (6 bytes will get you considerably beyond the built-in limitations of AMP already) and again, immediately error out if that is exceeded.  Similarly the trailing comma provides an in-band sanity check where buggy applications will promptly crash rather than bleeding into the next message.

&gt;<i> Could the next AMP version
</I>&gt;<i> use values framed using 32 bit or 64 bit integers ?
</I>
I'd really rather go with netstrings for all the reasons listed above.

&gt;<i> Transmitting long-ish values is a real use case and whatever extension
</I>&gt;<i> we do must retain the dead-simple, easy to implement nature of the
</I>&gt;<i> current AMP protocol. I now realise that I somewhat hijacked the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;streaming values&quot; bug (2529). IMHO, streaming should be handled at the
</I>&gt;<i> application level, but I digress.
</I>
Yeah, that bug is more about making it easy to do the application-level stuff than implementing something implicit within the protocol.

&gt;&gt;<i> ----
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BTW this is also my suggestion for the PR trying to introduce support for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SMB.... have twisted SMB implementation in a separate project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All the best,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jonathan
</I>
Same to you.  Thanks for your contributions, and sorry for the slow pace of communication here; 2020 is a heck of a year.
