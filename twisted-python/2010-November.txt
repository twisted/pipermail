Have you tried seeing if Cython works with Clang? That ought to be a
very minor change to our code.

This violates our deprecation policy... so I suggest we only do it if
absolutely must, i.e. if Glyph's fixes + Cython don't fix the problem.

Thank you! It's a pleasure to have one's code be called by code in
the Twisted framework and to get stuff done with it! And it's an
honor to receive support from such a wonderful community, already
ever so enjoyable and enlightening even when just lurking among it!

Good point, I totally agree with you. "correctly" is most often the
wrong word and a shortcut which leads to unpleasant consequences
once what is "correct" gets better defined later by explicitly
broken behavior.

BTW that line was actually shamelessly copy-pasted from the previous
test's docstring ;P

OK, take two:

This test checks that a protocol gets notified of a lost connection
when its transport has a registered producer writing more than 64KB
to it and is then asked to stopProducing without any more data being
written to it. This ought to prevent that sockets get stuck in
CLOSE_WAIT state when these peculiar conditions occur. See #4719.


Another thing I'm not too sure about is if TCPClientTestsBuilder
("Builder defining tests relating to L{IReactorTCP.connectTCP}.") is
the right class for holding such a test, which is not very related
to connectTCP.


ciao thanks

Here are the complete results for all combinations:

Quite so.  It seems like an okay violation to me, since according to the 
table above the best possible behavior cfreactor is able to provide is 
that sometimes it will build and run for a while before segfaulting.

err, it seems to fix that issue but it introduces another issue:

Alright, I added a test case that replicates the new error
introduced by the above change and included it in a new proposed fix:

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/attachment/ticket/4719/avoid_hang_in_CLOSE_WAIT_take2.patch

if self.connected and self.disconnecting:
    self.startWriting()

This new patch now passes both new unit tests.

post them to the ticket page instead of polluting the mailing list

That table is also non-deterministic.  I've seen different behavior on different machines, which then changed again when I went back to look again.

In no case was I able to get anywhere close to completing a test suite run, though.

Message-ID: <AANLkTik_RW-YEVy+GbReriWrx7ZYBXSJWJ+5BReqMjV2@mail.gmail.com>

I stripped down my app but this should give you an example of what i'm doing

def run_app(f):
    p = Popen(['/usr/bin/app'],stdout=PIPE)
    while True:
        o = p.stdout.readline()
        if o == '' and p.poll() != None: break

        reactor.callFromThread(f, o)

class Echo(Protocol):
    def connectionMade(self):

        reactor.callInThread(run_app, self.appDataReceived)

    def dataReceived(self, data):
        data = data.strip()
        if data == "getmore":
            print "getmore"

    def appDataReceived(self, u):
        print u

def main():
    factory = Factory()
    factory.protocol = Echo
    reactor.listenTCP(3646, factory)
    reactor.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


I have an app which I want to connect in and run a app that
continually spits out data to stdout. Right now my app works but the
issue is when the client exits the socket connection the /usr/bin/app
still continues to run. The more socket connections made the more this
app is still running.

Is there anyway from the Echo Procool to kill the run_app() function?

Instead of using run_app (which I assume is in run in a thread?), using
reactor.spawnProcess will let you have the process management integrated
with Twisted:

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Inconsistency in ReconnectingClientFactory
Message-ID: <1288785674.4cd14f0a4e68b@xhost3.wss>

Hi!

The ReconnectingClientFactory class allows to define the instance
variable maxDelay. Its documentation is "Maximum number of seconds
between connection attempts."

maxDelay is used in the retry() method to bound self.delay. But this        
happens in the _first_ step of the calculation of self.delay.
Afterwards, the bounded value is modified again by applying
random.normalvariate to allow for the jitter. This can result in a value
that is considerably bigger than maxDelay.

Is there any reason that maxDelay is not used for bounding the final
result of the calculation of self.delay? If not, the calculation should
be fixed - I'd be happy to file an issue ;-).

Best regards,

Albert

One reason to prefer not to have a fixed value as maxDelay is that 
always picking a random values ensures that you'll never have a stampede 
of clients all attempting connections at once.  It might be best to just 
correct the documentation for maxDelay to point out that it's not 
actually a hard maximum, just the average value the maximums will 
cluster around.  That's certainly worth a ticket.

On modern linux, signalfd can be used to convert sigchld into an event on a 
file descriptor.  Looks like just what is wanted for processProtocol.

There is also a python interface here:
https://launchpad.net/python-signalfd/+download

This test seems to work for me:

import signalfd
import signal
import subprocess
import select

signalfd.sigprocmask (signalfd.SIG_BLOCK, [signal.SIGCHLD])
fd = signalfd.signalfd (-1, [signal.SIGCHLD])

child = subprocess.Popen (['sleep', '5'])
while True:
    a,b,c, = select.select ([fd], [], [])
    print 'a:', a, 'b:', b, 'c:', c
    if child.poll() != None:
        break

It does, indeed.  I'm not sure it's really worth bothering though.  Here 
are the drawbacks of using signalfd():

   - It only works on Linux
   - It works differently on older versions of Linux than on newer 
versions
   - You still can't have another SIGCHLD handler installed that will 
called (so it's not any more cooperative with other library code)

As compared to using SA_RESTART with a normal SIGCHLD handler, this is 
two extra drawbacks.  The advantages of signalfd() are:

    - It's just another fd, so the reactor doesn't need as much special 
support code

But this advantage is negated by the fact that we still need the special 
support code for older versions of Linux and for other platforms.

If anyone's aware of other advantages or drawbacks of one approach or 
the other, it would be interesting to hear about them.  Otherwise, it 
doesn't seem like it's worth changing.

Thanks for the suggestion! :)

Another drawback is that spawned subprocesses will start with SIGCHLD blocked (because the sigprocmask is inherited across fork/exec, like SIG_IGN is, but unlike signal handlers), unless twisted adds a pthread_atfork handler (which there is no way to do from Python, so that'd have to be more custom C code). And even with that, system() would still remain broken, because system() inexplicably doesn't call atfork handlers on linux/glibc (notabug according to glibc maintainers).

Of course, the Twisted process API could unblock SIGCHLD itself before calling exec, but this would leave spawning a process with any other API (subprocess/etc) broken. Many programs will not react well to starting with SIGCHLD blocked.

Since Twisted just recently managed to make spawning subprocesses with non-Twisted APIs actually work right, it'd be quite poor to break that again.

I often use "nohup" for this sort of thing.  An alternative would be to add
it to /etc/init.d and /etc/rc?.d

Cheers,

Write your server as a .tac file or twistd plugin, and then run twistd without -n.

You might want to have a look at daemontools
(http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html). It will also take care of
restarting your daemons if they die.

Hi,

Deferring OSX API's until after daemonisation was the solution. My test script, fixed by James, works on macbook, but when I run it on a remote OSX server mini, it doesn't. It crashes as before with USING_FORK_WITHOUT_EXEC_IS_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_FILE_MANAGER) . Both machines run the same versions of python, pyobjc, twisted.  Some digging showed that on the mini twisted.application.reactors imports zope.interface, which in turn runs this:
	__import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__)
and this causes Carbon to be loaded, before daemonisation. I can't defer loading reactor because I need it to make things tick, so I'm stuck.

Could this be related to http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4644 ?
Any clues to why pkg_resources would cause Carbon to load on one machine, but not on another?
Any clues to prevent it these modules from loading?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] [newb] another process question
Message-ID: <ib23up$e1m$1@dough.gmane.org>

Using this code:
...
    def processEnded(self, reason):
        print "processEnded, task %s, status %s" % (self.task, 
reason.value.exitCode,)

Here is what I get from a normally terminated process
processEnded, task ['sleep', '4']31662, status 0

But now I kill the subprocess, with SIGTERM, and I get:

processEnded, task ['sleep', '15']31663, status None

This seems to disagree with the twisted process doc.
Instead of an exitCode, I seem to have gotten 'None'

.processEnded(status): This is called when the child process has been 
reaped, and receives information about the process' exit status. The status 
is passed in the form of a Failure instance, created with a .value that 
either holds a ProcessDone object if the process terminated normally (it 
died of natural causes instead of receiving a signal, and if the exit code 
was 0), or a ProcessTerminated object (with an .exitCode attribute) if 
something went wrong. This scheme may seem a bit weird, but I trust that it 
proves useful when dealing with exceptions that occur in asynchronous code.

The deal is, there are multiple kinds of 'went wrong' in the Unix
process model. One kind (described the documentation you quote above) is
a non-zero exit code; you can test this by running "/bin/false" rather
than "sleep 15" as your test command. Another kind is 'killed by
a signal', in which case the value "returned" by the process encodes the
number of the signal that killed it, rather than a process-defined error
code.

Looking at the source of the ProcessTerminated class mentioned:

    http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk/twisted/internet/error.py#L268

...it looks like killing a process with a signal puts 'None' in the
.exitCode property, and the signal number in the .signal property. The
instance also has a useful str() representation if you just want to log
a sensible error message.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Conch as a file transfer server
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=LieWCiKz37OWw=r01b8OOSqLD1xCWXu-=PT1_@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!


I've figured out vaguely how to use Conch as a file transfer client
thanks to the cftp script. I'm currently trying to adapt the simple
SSH server script example (link below) to do file *serving*. I can't
find any example code that actually does this or documentation on this
subject.

There's conch's test_filetransfer which indeed does have some server
parts, but being unit tests they gloss over a lot of the things I
think I need to know to get this working for an actual file server.
For example, what's the difference between SSHSession and ISession?
They both appear to be 'sessions' in the SSH sense. Why does ISession
not do anything about subsystems? Do I need one if I'm just using a
subsystem and not opening a shell? If so: is it just a stub, or does
it need to implement behavior? I would guess it's just stubs, since
invoking subsystems does not mean opening a shell.

link to the example:
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/conch/examples/index.html#auto0

Ideally, does anyone have any code somewhere that actually serves a file?

thanks in advance,
lvh

I don't have minimal code, but in the Launchpad tree there are two
SFTP servers, written with Conch.

$ bzr co lp:launchpad
Look in lib/lp/services/sshserver for the common code;
lib/lp/codehosting/sshserver for one implementation; lib/lp/poppy for
another.

Alternatively:
  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~launchpad-pqm/launchpad/db-devel/files/head:/lib/lp/codehosting/sshserver/
  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~launchpad-pqm/launchpad/db-devel/files/head:/lib/lp/services/

Hope this helps,

FWIW, I found a workaround. The remote machine had setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.egg, the local machine setuptools-0.6c9-py2.6.egg. Reverting to c9 prevents Carbon to be loaded with pkg_resources, which in turn enables daemonisation. The child happily runs twisted and quartz.

I'd still be interested to see how twisted / daemon / OSX API  is supposed to work with setuptools c11. But I'm happy I can continue.

thanks,
Erik

Well, clearly it doesn't work :).

Please feel free to open another ticket.  You are correct in saying that this is related to <http://tm.tl/4644>, but that ticket is specifically about a test, and the proposed solution there is to make the test sensitive.

<http://bugs.python.org/issue7895> was the bug in Python that causes this, which has since been fixed. Although apparently the fix was not quite in time for 2.7, it looks to me like it has been committed to the 2.7 (and 2.6) branches, so perhaps we will see some point-releases which fix it.  So in future versions of Python, Twisted will not be affected by this issue.

However, it may be good to get a workaround in Twisted anyway, for those who have to deal with the combination of older Python / newer Setuptools, or a better fix, like changing the order of daemonization.  So a ticket is definitely worthwhile.

Okay, tried to learn something out of that. If I understand correctly
SSHSession is the low-level thing that actually handles SSH-specific
gunk, and ISession is the customizable thing. File transfer was
implemented separately. When something wants file transfer, Conch
tries to adapt the avatar to ISFTPServer instead of ISession. Is that
right?

I've found code that does both (adaptation of a ConchUser
implementation to ISFTPServer and ISession) in unix.py.

Yeah, that sounds right, although I'm not going to look up the code to
double check.

You want the ISession around to handle non-SFTP connections: shell
requests, command exec etc.

Because it looks like I need to learn a lot more to use it.  But I'll try.

It's not difficult or long at all, at least you could read this[1]

I seem to have things working OK with twistd.

My app is a batch scheduling system that listens for commands via xmlrpc.  
It is very simple at this point, and I'm attaching it.  I would welcome any 
suggestions for improvement, since I'm a newb to twisted, and a lot of this 
was guesswork.

task.py is a seperate file because otherwise pickle doesn't work.  t6.tac is 
the server, and a toy client is client4.py.

If I could you give a suggestion on how to structure the server side of
your program:

The ``Task`` class in a separate file, this is fine, clients could
import the file without the need to import the non useful, for the
client, server code.

All the server logic in a file and a third file for the tap, here a
possible structure:

	procxmlrpc/
		|- client.py
		|- server.py
		`- task.py
	twisted/
		`- plugins/
			`- procxmlrpc_plugin.py

Here the simplified code, all the remaining code goes into ``server.py``

	from procxmlrpc.server import Spawner

	from twisted.web import server
	from twisted.application import service, internet

	application = service.Application("Demo application")
	spawn_server = server.Site(Spawner())
	service = internet.TCPServer(7080, spawn_server)
	service.setServiceParent(application)

This should of course be avoided. On the other hand, it is convenient to
have the ability to define a maximum delay (and the name of the variable
suggests that the delay won't be any bigger).

Maybe it's better to change the calculation such that the random value
is always below maxDelay. If the first parameter to random.normalvariate
is adapted in the right way, the result should always be lower than 
maxDelay.

I'll create one, but leave open how to solve the inconsistency.

Best regards,

Thanks for the suggestions.

I'd also like to add authentication, but it seems rather daunting.

Maybe I could just restrict the xmlrpc to listen only on connection from the 
local host?

You should not. Add basic or digest authentication is really easy. Take
a look at Calderone's Twisted Web in 60 seconds: HTTP authentication[1],
I read the series time ago and I don't remember exactly the content but
the serie is really well written, the best 60 seconds (per episode)
spent to learn the bases of twisted web.

> Maybe I could just restrict the xmlrpc to listen only on connection from the 
> local host?

yes, you could and twisted tap plugin system helps you on this. Just
create a tap plugin with the options you need. An simple example:


	from twisted.python import usage
	from twisted.plugin import IPlugin
    from twisted.application import strports, service

	class Options(usage.Options):

		optParameters = [
				['port', 'p', '80', 'Listen port.', int],
				['interface', 'i', None, 'Interface to which to bind.'],
				]


	class ProcessXMLRPCServiceMaker(object):
		implements(service.IServiceMaker, IPlugin)
		tapname = "processxmlrpc"
		description = "Remote process control in xmlrpc"
		options = Options

		def makeService(self, options):
			factory = ... # XXX
			description = 'tcp:' + str(config['port'])
			if config['interface']:
				description += ':interface=' + config['interface']
			return strports.service(description, factory)


You can setup the server to listen to localhost and prepare a reverse
proxy that require authentication and that accept connections from all
interfaces, as example.

My simple batch processing system is moved here:

Seems to be reasonably functional.  Any suggestions/contributions 
appreciated.

One thing todo is to add some authentication.  For now the server listens 
for xmlrpc requests and will run any command without authentication.  In my 
current environment (single user system, firewalled), that's not a fatal 
flaw.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] wxReactor Issues
Message-ID: <183F75F0C38.00000278rsgames@inbox.com>

Hello,
My Twisted Python application with wxReactor crashes every time the user exits the application. The OnClose event calls a method that does reactor.stop(). I've ran this through gdb, and have noticed that this is because 2 threads aren't getting closed. What I find strange though, that is if the server closes the connection to the user, the 2 threads exit, and you are able to close the application our properly. I have tried running reactor.disconnectAll() before the reactor.stop() in my OnClose event, with no luck. The client closes the connection to the server, but the threads do not exit. I have also this patch found here (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3948):
if wxreactor.WxReactor.callFromThread is not None:
    oldStop = wxreactor.WxReactor.stop
    def stopFromThread(self):
        reactor.callFromThread(oldStop)
    wxreactor.WxReactor.stop = stopFromThread

This problem occurs when I do and don't call the MainLoop() on the wx.App(). If you all could provide some insight on this, I would be very grateful.
Thank you.

Hi,
Yes, I tried the code below with no luck.
The OnClose() event calls this:
def KillSock():
 if wxreactor.WxReactor.callFromThread is not None:
    oldStop = wxreactor.WxReactor.stop
    def stopFromThread(self):
        reactor.callFromThread(oldStop)
    wxreactor.WxReactor.stop = stopFromThread
 reactor.stop()

When I ran this code in gdb, it did not say the two threads exited like they should do.

Thank you.

What do you mean when you say "crashes"?  A SIGSEGV is probably due to a 
bug in CPython or (more likely) wxPython.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] ProcessProtocol stdin/stdout loop
Message-ID: <4CDFFB26.5050905@baudvine.net>

Hi all,

It appears that I have managed to loop a ProcessProtocol subclass's
transport.write() right back into its outReceived.  It's not directly
called, which leads me to believe that somehow stdin and stdout got tied
up.  Anything thrown at transport.write() doesn't appear to reach the
actual process.  I checked by running `cat > log` through it, the file
'log' is created but remains empty.

I am baffled, but will continue to poke at it.  In the meantime, I'd
love to hear if anyone has a clue as to what I might have messed up.

Thanks,

Forgot to mention that the ProcessProtocol instance does receive
whatever the process sends my way.

Can you provide a minimal, self-contained code example demonstrating
this?

Hi,
Well, I close the application (by clicking the X). Then a few seconds later, Ubuntu comes up with a dialog asking me if I want to force quit the application. gdb reports the following when I force quit: Program terminated with signal SIGKILL, Killed.

As far as to why it is crashing, I'm almost positive it is because there are two threads that aren't getting stopped properly.
Thank you.

That's *not* "crashing", that's "not exiting". The SIGKILL is coming
from the forced kill. So the real issue is, it's not exiting, and it's
not exiting because, as you say, there's still threads running. Does
your program start/use any threads itself?

Hi,
Yes, it uses the speechd module on Linux (which uses a thread). The speechd module provided speech output for our visually impaired users. However, when I run the program without speechd at all, I still have this problem. I'm pretty sure it is wxreactor and not speechd that is causing this problem.
Thank you.

Hi,
I think the best way to debug this is to give you all the source code. You can find it here: http://bit.ly/doEiEJ

To give you all some background on this project: It is a freeware client that uses sockets to connect to a multiplayer game server (currently plays Monopoly and Uno). You will immediately notice there are no graphics. That is because this client only provides audio feedback through speech synthesis and sound effects. The target audience of this project is visually impaired gamers. 

To test the issue, run python rsg.py (which can be found in the src folder. In case you need to know, I use Python 2.6.5). In a terminal, you will see the output the program produces (which is mostly what the server sends to our client). Once you see the line "Connection Made" (which should print very shortly after running), try closing the program (by clicking the X). The client will hang for a few seconds, and then you will need to force quit the application (on Ubuntu, it comes up asking if I want to force quit the application). say

It should be noted that this issue does not occur on Windows, only on Linux (I've tested with Ubuntu) and Mac. 

Thank you.

This appears to be caused by nox's use of private Twisted APIs which no 
longer exist.  You can try installing an older version of Twisted or 
updating nox to work with the version you're using now.

Linux (Ubuntu 9.10)
Python 2.6.4
Twisted trunk at 30276
wxPython 2.8.10.1-0ubuntu1

The demo exits quickly when I click the window-manager provided close 
window button.

And, if you switch reactor.stop() with
reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop) you still have the problem? What

Subject: [Twisted-Python] sample unit testing for xml-rpc's
Message-ID: <AANLkTim92hG+LeZr+XicZ3wuFv28ck0QFx1Ht_=GkDic@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I want to know how to test xml-rpc functions written using python-twisted. I
came across trial framework. But cant find proper information regarding
that.

Can anyone provide info regarding this or sample unit test-case how to test
that.

Thanks in advance

Twisted: 10.0.0-2ubuntu2
Python: 2.6.5

Hi,
I have found something interesting. When I do not call sys.exit(), and just call this:  reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop), the program exits properly. I was wondering if it was safe to not call sys.exit()? If so I think the problem is fixed.
Thank you.

sys.exit() will raise an exception, SystemExit. It's certainly possible
that raising it will cause problems, though I wouldn't expect it to keep
threads from exiting. It's possible there's some race condition involved
that is less likely to happen due to this change. Regardless, You should
not call it if you're using Twisted (or if you do, it should be called
after reactor.run()).

Nope, that's not a "real" atfork: it only monkey-patches python's os.fork() function, so it doesn't catch any fork done by C code. So it's not good enough. (but of course, as mentioned previously, pthread_atfork itself isn't good enough either).

Message-ID: <476545CB486.000001A2rsgames@inbox.com>

Hi,
I have been using the following code to show the user a TextEntryDialog, that would allow users to enter data in, and press return. Since I've started using Twisted, this doesn't work on Mac OS X. The dialog pops up okay, but you can't actually enter any data into the box. The cursor does not appear. When I click inside the box to try to make it appear, it quickly disappears again.
def handle_input(data):
 prompt=data.replace("+INPUT ","")
 new=wx.TextEntryDialog(global_vars.frame, "", prompt)
 new.Raise()
 if new.ShowModal() == wx.ID_OK:
  socks.sockObj.sendData(new.GetValue())
 else:
  socks.sockObj.sendData("+~!?CANCEL?!~")
  new.Destroy()

Thank you.

You probably want to avoid modal dialogs (in any toolkit) when 
integrating with Twisted.  The require a reentrant mainloop to 
implement, and no Twisted reactor (ie, mainloop) is reentrant.

Whether or not the fact that this is a modal dialog is actually causing 
this particular problem, I don't know.

Hi,
Okay. Well that's not so great - these TextEntryDialogs are quite important to the program. Anyway on Windows and Linux, ShowModal() seems to work really well with wxreactor, and it is only Mac OS X that is the problem.
Thank you.

The key word here is "seems".  You will get weird errors on those platforms eventually, you just haven't yet.

Anyway, it's fine to use dialogs with Twisted.  The issue is APIs like ShowModal(), which expect to be able to block.  Instead you should be using Show(), and make your own API that returns a Deferred from your dialog.

Other toolkits allow you to show a modal dialog without blocking your whole program: for example, with GTK, you can pass the gtk.DIALOG_MODAL flag to gtk.Dialog, and then simply call gtk.Dialog.show_all() instead of gtk.Dialog.run().  wxwindows appears to incorrectly conflate the idea of a modal dialog with a particular type of control flow.

(In my personal opinion, modal dialogs are terrible UI anyway, and should be avoided.  You should be able to prompt the user without interrupting everything else they're doing in the program.)

I agree for 99% of dialogs, but modal dialogs actually make sense for a 
few things.  For example, the "Do you really want to quit the program 
without saving?" dialog in many editors.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimVEkQ7LZ90HC3KgrgiH3_pKPbmAKGjKrp4BBG8@mail.gmail.com>

Despite a brief and unsuccessful attempt by Canadian forces to wrest control
of the Twisted release process, it continues.  The francophone domination of
North America may be inevitable, but it won't happen today.  Coming to you
from an ominous tower above Cambridge, Massachusetts, Twisted 10.2.0,
pre-release 3, is here!

You may - and should! - retrieve it from <
http://twistedmatrix.com/users/glyph/10.2.0pre3/>.

To avoid any further delays in getting this release out, we will be keeping
to a tight schedule.  Unless there are any undiscovered, unfixed regressions
from 10.1.0,* the final release of Twisted 10.2.0 will be made on November
29, 2010.  That is **one week from today.*

**Developers, please install the release now and test with your
applications, so you won't be caught off guard when the final release is
made.

This new pre-release includes important bugfixes and several exciting new
features.  Just since the previous prerelease:

   - A new, simpler, *substantially* more robust CoreFoundation reactor.
   http://tm.tl/1833
   - A plug-in API for adding new types of endpoint descriptions.
   http://tm.tl/4695

Other highlights, since the 10.1 release:

   - Improvements to the implementation of Deferred which should both
   improve performance and fix certain runtime errors with long callback
   chains. http://tm.tl/411
   - Deferred.setTimeout is (finally) gone.  http://tm.tl/1702
   - NetstringReceiver is substantially faster. http://tm.tl/4378

Thanks to everyone who worked on the release automation tools, for making
this release possible.  I can guarantee that if I had to spend a moment
longer on it, it wouldn't have gotten done.

Hi,

I am trying to package it on OpenBSD, and there are quite a number of
regression tests that don't pass there: failures, errors, busy loops,
... 10.0.0 was almost ok in this regard (I slacked on 10.1.0...)
I'm looking into these issues, and I will create tickets for those.

Starting now: http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4747

So in my opinion, the function should really return the list of actually
opened files in all cases, and not fallback to a list of possible
list, otherwise
the test case makes no sense. Of course this means trying all fds as last resort
on platforms that don't provide a simpler way to do it.  Doing it there or
doing it by ignoring EBADF on close() later would be the same, as far as
"suboptimization" is concerned.

Another (nicer?) possibility to achieve the "close non standard fds" would be
to use closefrom().

No, it's much worse :)
While trying to fix the issue, I was surpised to notice that python had 5 opened
fds by default here... After digging a bit further, I found out it is
actually due to
python being linked with libpthread, which installs a pair of pipe at init...

For the general case no, but for the intended purpose I'd say use closefrom()

Maybe so.  Fortunately the problem really seems only to be with the 
_test_, right?  On OpenBSD the fallback case will really be used, and 
the file descriptors we want to close will be closed?

Right, and this is just what should happen on OpenBSD now.

Hopefully these are already marked as CLOEXEC, or lots of people would 
already be having lots of problems with them.  Despite that, they should 
be closed by `reactor.spawnProcess` (because that doesn't hurt and it's 
simpler than checking for CLOEXEC).  Then the only problem is that they 
are recreated in the child process and mess up the test's assumptions.

Perhaps another approach to testing this function would be to create a 
file descriptor and assert that:

  - That file descriptor is not open in the child process
  - stdin, stdout, and sterr are open in the child process

Only, without some care, one of the pthread pipe fds might end up 
looking like the probe descriptor, so maybe that can't really work.

closefrom() doesn't appear to help.  Descriptors intended to be kept 
open may be mixed together with descriptors which must be closed.  This 
is because of the `childFDs` parameter to `reactor.spawnProcess`, which 
allows arbitrary file descriptors to be passed to the child.

Well, actually no... On bsd, the /dev/* files are statically created. So as it
is now, it picks the 64 existing /dev/fd/* files, which is not correct
since higher
fd with a higher number will never be found. This is getting tricky. So if one
can't trust /dev/fd/ on some platform, maybe it should not be tried at all,
or we need to find a way to know at runtime/configure time if this is safe...

That is closer to what the test is really about : spawnProcess don't leave
an undesired fd opened.

Right, I overlooked that.

Oh, I have just thought of another way to test all opened fds in just
one syscall.
It goes like this:

import resource
import select

_poll = [ 0, None ]

def listOpenFDs():
        maxfd = resource.getrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_NOFILE)[0]
        if maxfd != _poll[0]:
                _poll[0] = maxfd
                _poll[1] = select.poll()
                for fd in xrange(maxfd):
                        _poll[1].register(fd)
        return [ d for (d, r) in _poll[1].poll() if r != select.POLLNVAL ]

Hi Eric,

Thanks for participating in the release process!  It's very satisfying to actually get some feedback in response to a prerelease ;).

If OpenBSD were a supported platform, a bug like this would cause the release process to stop until it could be addressed; as it is, we will try to merge a bugfix into the release branch if it is available and reviewed in time (before next Monday).  Being a supported platform means that there's a buildbot, and that it shows up on this page: <http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/boxes-supported>.  Of course, if OpenBSD were a supported platform, this bug never would have been introduced in the first place, because we would have noticed failing tests immediately!

Does anyone feel like contributing an OpenBSD buildslave, and hopefully also some more expertise for fixing bugs on that platform?  Or, for that matter, any other *BSDs?

Sure. I have a couple of test machines for OpenBSD (amd64 and sparc64)
that are mostly idling, and that could be used for that. I just need
to know the procedure for setting up a buildbot, and I'll see what I
can do.  That would surely help me with the port maintainance.

Eric.

That'd be great.  The machines need to be online basically 100% of the 
time, and be able to make an outgoing TCP connection.  Other than that, 
they'll stay idle except when someone commits to trunk or wants to try 
out a branch before merging.  You can find more detailed instructions on 
the wiki:

I have started setting things up. I would need credentials for

	v1.8.1
Message-ID: <AANLkTinU=MMyMFP+aOeC8aA05QsOt0v8R6FvEoX0Sk6v@mail.gmail.com>

Folks:

Tahoe-LAFS uses Twisted extensively, and we try to contribute a few
patches back to Twisted itself when we can.

Regards,

Zooko


ANNOUNCING Tahoe, the Least-Authority File System, v1.8.1

The Tahoe-LAFS team is pleased to announce the immediate
availability of version 1.8.1 of Tahoe-LAFS, an extremely
reliable distributed storage system. Get it here:

http://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe/trunk/docs/quickstart.html

Tahoe-LAFS is the first distributed storage system to offer
"provider-independent security" ? meaning that not even the
operators of your storage servers can read or alter your data
without your consent. Here is the one-page explanation of its
unique security and fault-tolerance properties:

http://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe/trunk/docs/about.html

The previous stable release of Tahoe-LAFS was v1.8.0, which was
released September 23, 2010 [1].

v1.8.1 is a stable bugfix release correcting a number of minor
issues. It also includes a modest performance improvement in
downloading, and a fix for a security issue involving HTTP
proxies. See the NEWS file [2] for details.


WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?

With Tahoe-LAFS, you distribute your filesystem across
multiple servers, and even if some of the servers fail or are
taken over by an attacker, the entire filesystem continues to
work correctly, and continues to preserve your privacy and
security. You can easily share specific files and directories
with other people.

In addition to the core storage system itself, volunteers
have built other projects on top of Tahoe-LAFS and have
integrated Tahoe-LAFS with existing systems, including
Windows, JavaScript, iPhone, Android, Hadoop, Flume, Django,
Puppet, bzr, mercurial, perforce, duplicity, TiddlyWiki, and
more. See the Related Projects page on the wiki [3].

We believe that strong cryptography, Free and Open Source
Software, erasure coding, and principled engineering practices
make Tahoe-LAFS safer than RAID, removable drive, tape,
on-line backup or cloud storage.

This software is developed under test-driven development, and
there are no known bugs or security flaws which would
compromise confidentiality or data integrity under recommended
use. (For all important issues that we are currently aware of
please see the known_issues.rst file [4].)


COMPATIBILITY

This release is compatible with the version 1 series of
Tahoe-LAFS. Clients from this release can write files and
directories in the format used by clients of all versions back
to v1.0 (which was released March 25, 2008). Clients from this
release can read files and directories produced by clients of
all versions since v1.0. Servers from this release can serve
clients of all versions back to v1.0 and clients from this
release can use servers of all versions back to v1.0.

This is the twelfth release in the version 1 series. This
series of Tahoe-LAFS will be actively supported and maintained
for the forseeable future, and future versions of Tahoe-LAFS
will retain the ability to read and write files compatible
with this series.

*BSD, and probably most other systems. Start with
"docs/quickstart.html" [7].


HACKING AND COMMUNITY

Please join us on the mailing list [8]. Patches are gratefully
accepted -- the RoadMap page [9] shows the next improvements
that we plan to make and CREDITS [10] lists the names of people
who've contributed to the project. The Dev page [11] contains
resources for hackers.


SPONSORSHIP

Tahoe-LAFS was originally developed by Allmydata, Inc., a
provider of commercial backup services. After discontinuing
funding of Tahoe-LAFS R&D in early 2009, they continued
to provide servers, bandwidth, small personal gifts as tokens
of appreciation, and bug reports.

Google, Inc. sponsored Tahoe-LAFS development as part of the
Google Summer of Code 2010. They awarded four sponsorships to
students from around the world to hack on Tahoe-LAFS that
summer.

Thank you to Allmydata and Google for their generous and
public-spirited support.


HACK TAHOE-LAFS!

If you can find a security flaw in Tahoe-LAFS which is serious
enough that we feel compelled to warn our users and issue a fix,
then we will award you with a customized t-shirts with your
exploit printed on it and add you to the "Hack Tahoe-LAFS Hall
Of Fame" [12].


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This is the sixth release of Tahoe-LAFS to be created solely
as a labor of love by volunteers. Thank you very much to the
team of "hackers in the public interest" who make Tahoe-LAFS
possible.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] twisted.web,
	url -> resource mapping and isLeaf questions
Message-ID: <4CF49495.502@silveregg.co.jp>

Hi,

I am following "twisted in 60sec" series, but even the simple examples 
are a bit unclear to me, especially w.r.t. url mapping. For example:

# assume the right imports...
class MainPage(Resource):
     isLeaf = True
     def render_GET(self, request):
         return "somestring"

resource = MainPage()
factory = Site(resource)
reactor.listenTCP(8880, factory)
reactor.run()

I was expecting that accessing any other 'path' besides the main url 
would cause 404, e.g. "http://localhost:8880/foo/bar", and I get the 
same page instead.

I gather this is a consequence of the isLeaf setting set to be True, 
because twisted.web stops as soon as it encounters MainPage in the 
hierarchy and use that for rendering. Setting it to False seems to avoid 
the page to be available at all. The solution I got instead is something 
like:

class RootPage(Resource):
     isLeaf = False
     def render(self, request):
         return "somestring"

     def getChild(self, path, request):
         if path:
             return NoResource()
         else:
             return self

and adding new resources through putChild. Isn't there a more natural 
way of doing things ?

cheers,

David

Subject: [Twisted-Python] [ANNOUNCE] Twisted 10.2.0 Released
Message-ID: <48EF5F73-CAE0-43CC-89A9-FD273C334E79@twistedmatrix.com>

Twisted 10.2.0, the third Twisted release of 2010, has emerged from the mysterious depths of Twisted Matrix Labs, as so many releases before it.  Survivors of the release process - what few there were of them - have been heard to claim that this version is "awesome", "even more robust", "fun-sized" and "oven fresh".

Crossing several things that shouldn't ought to be, including the streams and the rubicon, I have assumed the triple responsibilities of feature author, project leader, *and* release manager for 10.2: with this dark and terrible power - a power which no man ought to wield alone - I have wrought a release which contains many exciting new features, including:

    - A plug-in API for adding new types of endpoint descriptions. <http://tm.tl/4695>
    - A new, simpler, substantially more robust CoreFoundation reactor.  <http://tm.tl/1833>
    - Improvements to the implementation of Deferred which should both improve performance
      and fix certain runtime errors with long callback chains. <http://tm.tl/411>
    - Deferred.setTimeout is (finally) gone.  To quote the author of this change:
      "A new era of peace has started."  <http://tm.tl/1702>
    - NetstringReceiver is substantially faster. <http://tm.tl/4378>

And, of course, nearly one hundred smaller bug fixes, documentation updates, and general improvements.  See the NEWS file included in the release for more details.

Look upon our Twisted, ye mighty, and make your network applications event-driven: get it now, from:

    <http://twistedmatrix.com/>

... or simply install the 'Twisted' package from PyPI.

Many thanks to Christopher Armstrong, for his work on release-automation tools that made this possible; to Jonathan Lange, for thoroughly documenting the process and thereby making my ascent to the throne of release manager possible, and to Jean-Paul Calderone for his tireless maintenance of our build and test infrastructure as well as his help with the release.

Most of all, thanks to everyone who contributed a patch, reported a bug or reviewed a ticket for 10.2.  Not including those already thanked, there are 41 of you, so it would be a bit tedious to go through everyone, but you know who you are and we absolutely couldn't do it without you!  Thanks a ton!

No.

I'm not sure what you're asking here; it seems like you've figured out the resource model.  It has some rough edges, which we are trying to eventually fix (see, for example, <http://tm.tl/3621>).  But the things you're talking about are just how it works; <http://example.com/> is a collection, just like <http://example.com/foo/>, so it behaves in a consistent way.

Message-ID: <BA36A84D-8DEC-4D45-9834-B02157B3AAAF@optonline.net>

Hi,

I am using a Perspective Broker to service requests from a client on the same machine ( Windows XP ). This works fine most of the time however occasionally I see strange behaviour. The client uses connectTCP and provides a timeout of 5 seconds. Logging indicates that the client attempts to make a connection to the server, server logging in the remote methods indicates that the method is not called. Also my error callback on the client is not invoked after the timeout period. Unfotunately this is part of a large system, sporadic behaviour and difficult to generate a test case for.

Also commonly requests a few seconds before and after the issue are handled correctly so the behaviour seems transient. We are using a older version ot twisted 8.x. Any pointers?

Regards.

I've seen strange sporadic errors with networking in 8.x that weren't
there in 2.5.0, so would you be able to test it with 2.5.0?

Better yet, why not test with a recent release?  Something that starts with '10'?  There's a reason we keep doing new releases, you know: bugs get fixed :).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Handling of NMEA messages
Message-ID: <20101129120148.GB11887@weiermayer.com>

Hi!

We are working on a project that has to extract weather information from 
an NMEA stream. There is a NMEAReceiver class, but it only extracts GPS 
information - as expected, since the class is defined in t.p.gps.nmea.

We intend to add the NMEA-0183 messages necessary for my purposes. The
question is: should we just extend the NMEAReceiver? Weather information
is not exactly what one would expect in a class below t.p.gps...

On the other hand, it would be strange to create a different kind of
NMEAReceiver which knows how to handle the messages dealing with
weather data.

Best regards,

Albert

Have you tried seeing if Cython works with Clang? That ought to be a
very minor change to our code.

This violates our deprecation policy... so I suggest we only do it if
absolutely must, i.e. if Glyph's fixes + Cython don't fix the problem.

Thank you! It's a pleasure to have one's code be called by code in
the Twisted framework and to get stuff done with it! And it's an
honor to receive support from such a wonderful community, already
ever so enjoyable and enlightening even when just lurking among it!

Good point, I totally agree with you. "correctly" is most often the
wrong word and a shortcut which leads to unpleasant consequences
once what is "correct" gets better defined later by explicitly
broken behavior.

BTW that line was actually shamelessly copy-pasted from the previous
test's docstring ;P

OK, take two:

This test checks that a protocol gets notified of a lost connection
when its transport has a registered producer writing more than 64KB
to it and is then asked to stopProducing without any more data being
written to it. This ought to prevent that sockets get stuck in
CLOSE_WAIT state when these peculiar conditions occur. See #4719.


Another thing I'm not too sure about is if TCPClientTestsBuilder
("Builder defining tests relating to L{IReactorTCP.connectTCP}.") is
the right class for holding such a test, which is not very related
to connectTCP.


ciao thanks

Quite so.  It seems like an okay violation to me, since according to the 
table above the best possible behavior cfreactor is able to provide is 
that sometimes it will build and run for a while before segfaulting.

err, it seems to fix that issue but it introduces another issue:

I just saw this appearing once in the logs of my app after I applied
the patch I suggested:

I'll try to replicate and to figure out what does

Alright, I added a test case that replicates the new error
introduced by the above change and included it in a new proposed fix:

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/attachment/ticket/4719/avoid_hang_in_CLOSE_WAIT_take2.patch

if self.connected and self.disconnecting:
    self.startWriting()

This new patch now passes both new unit tests.

Sorry about the noise, if I find any more issues about this I'll
post them to the ticket page instead of polluting the mailing list

That table is also non-deterministic.  I've seen different behavior on different machines, which then changed again when I went back to look again.

In no case was I able to get anywhere close to completing a test suite run, though.

I stripped down my app but this should give you an example of what i'm doing

def run_app(f):
    p = Popen(['/usr/bin/app'],stdout=PIPE)
    while True:
        o = p.stdout.readline()
        if o == '' and p.poll() != None: break

        reactor.callFromThread(f, o)

class Echo(Protocol):
    def connectionMade(self):

        reactor.callInThread(run_app, self.appDataReceived)

    def dataReceived(self, data):
        data = data.strip()
        if data == "getmore":
            print "getmore"

    def appDataReceived(self, u):
        print u

def main():
    factory = Factory()
    factory.protocol = Echo
    reactor.listenTCP(3646, factory)
    reactor.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


I have an app which I want to connect in and run a app that
continually spits out data to stdout. Right now my app works but the
issue is when the client exits the socket connection the /usr/bin/app
still continues to run. The more socket connections made the more this
app is still running.

Is there anyway from the Echo Procool to kill the run_app() function?

Instead of using run_app (which I assume is in run in a thread?), using
reactor.spawnProcess will let you have the process management integrated
with Twisted:

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Inconsistency in ReconnectingClientFactory
Message-ID: <1288785674.4cd14f0a4e68b@xhost3.wss>

Hi!

The ReconnectingClientFactory class allows to define the instance
variable maxDelay. Its documentation is "Maximum number of seconds
between connection attempts."

maxDelay is used in the retry() method to bound self.delay. But this        
happens in the _first_ step of the calculation of self.delay.
Afterwards, the bounded value is modified again by applying
random.normalvariate to allow for the jitter. This can result in a value
that is considerably bigger than maxDelay.

Is there any reason that maxDelay is not used for bounding the final
result of the calculation of self.delay? If not, the calculation should
be fixed - I'd be happy to file an issue ;-).

Best regards,

Albert

One reason to prefer not to have a fixed value as maxDelay is that 
always picking a random values ensures that you'll never have a stampede 
of clients all attempting connections at once.  It might be best to just 
correct the documentation for maxDelay to point out that it's not 
actually a hard maximum, just the average value the maximums will 
cluster around.  That's certainly worth a ticket.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] signalfd
Message-ID: <iat383$uqo$1@dough.gmane.org>

On modern linux, signalfd can be used to convert sigchld into an event on a 
file descriptor.  Looks like just what is wanted for processProtocol.

There is also a python interface here:
https://launchpad.net/python-signalfd/+download

This test seems to work for me:

import signalfd
import signal
import subprocess
import select

signalfd.sigprocmask (signalfd.SIG_BLOCK, [signal.SIGCHLD])
fd = signalfd.signalfd (-1, [signal.SIGCHLD])

child = subprocess.Popen (['sleep', '5'])
while True:
    a,b,c, = select.select ([fd], [], [])
    print 'a:', a, 'b:', b, 'c:', c
    if child.poll() != None:
        break

It does, indeed.  I'm not sure it's really worth bothering though.  Here 
are the drawbacks of using signalfd():

   - It only works on Linux
   - It works differently on older versions of Linux than on newer 
versions
   - You still can't have another SIGCHLD handler installed that will 
called (so it's not any more cooperative with other library code)

As compared to using SA_RESTART with a normal SIGCHLD handler, this is 
two extra drawbacks.  The advantages of signalfd() are:

    - It's just another fd, so the reactor doesn't need as much special 
support code

But this advantage is negated by the fact that we still need the special 
support code for older versions of Linux and for other platforms.

If anyone's aware of other advantages or drawbacks of one approach or 
the other, it would be interesting to hear about them.  Otherwise, it 
doesn't seem like it's worth changing.

Thanks for the suggestion! :)

Another drawback is that spawned subprocesses will start with SIGCHLD blocked (because the sigprocmask is inherited across fork/exec, like SIG_IGN is, but unlike signal handlers), unless twisted adds a pthread_atfork handler (which there is no way to do from Python, so that'd have to be more custom C code). And even with that, system() would still remain broken, because system() inexplicably doesn't call atfork handlers on linux/glibc (notabug according to glibc maintainers).

Of course, the Twisted process API could unblock SIGCHLD itself before calling exec, but this would leave spawning a process with any other API (subprocess/etc) broken. Many programs will not react well to starting with SIGCHLD blocked.

Since Twisted just recently managed to make spawning subprocesses with non-Twisted APIs actually work right, it'd be quite poor to break that again.

I have put together a simple twisted server using xmlrpc and process.  I 
want to run this server as a unix daemon.

Specifically, detach from controlling terminal, and redirect stdout, stderr 
to a log file.

What is the easiest approach, and where to look for documentation on this?

I often use "nohup" for this sort of thing.  An alternative would be to add
it to /etc/init.d and /etc/rc?.d

Write your server as a .tac file or twistd plugin, and then run twistd without -n.

You might want to have a look at daemontools
(http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html). It will also take care of
restarting your daemons if they die.

Deferring OSX API's until after daemonisation was the solution. My test script, fixed by James, works on macbook, but when I run it on a remote OSX server mini, it doesn't. It crashes as before with USING_FORK_WITHOUT_EXEC_IS_NOT_SUPPORTED_BY_FILE_MANAGER) . Both machines run the same versions of python, pyobjc, twisted.  Some digging showed that on the mini twisted.application.reactors imports zope.interface, which in turn runs this:
	__import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__)
and this causes Carbon to be loaded, before daemonisation. I can't defer loading reactor because I need it to make things tick, so I'm stuck.

Could this be related to http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4644 ?
Any clues to why pkg_resources would cause Carbon to load on one machine, but not on another?
Any clues to prevent it these modules from loading?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] [newb] another process question
Message-ID: <ib23up$e1m$1@dough.gmane.org>

Using this code:
...
    def processEnded(self, reason):
        print "processEnded, task %s, status %s" % (self.task, 
reason.value.exitCode,)

Here is what I get from a normally terminated process
processEnded, task ['sleep', '4']31662, status 0

But now I kill the subprocess, with SIGTERM, and I get:

processEnded, task ['sleep', '15']31663, status None

This seems to disagree with the twisted process doc.
Instead of an exitCode, I seem to have gotten 'None'

.processEnded(status): This is called when the child process has been 
reaped, and receives information about the process' exit status. The status 
is passed in the form of a Failure instance, created with a .value that 
either holds a ProcessDone object if the process terminated normally (it 
died of natural causes instead of receiving a signal, and if the exit code 
was 0), or a ProcessTerminated object (with an .exitCode attribute) if 
something went wrong. This scheme may seem a bit weird, but I trust that it 
proves useful when dealing with exceptions that occur in asynchronous code.

The deal is, there are multiple kinds of 'went wrong' in the Unix
process model. One kind (described the documentation you quote above) is
a non-zero exit code; you can test this by running "/bin/false" rather
than "sleep 15" as your test command. Another kind is 'killed by
a signal', in which case the value "returned" by the process encodes the
number of the signal that killed it, rather than a process-defined error
code.

Looking at the source of the ProcessTerminated class mentioned:

    http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk/twisted/internet/error.py#L268

...it looks like killing a process with a signal puts 'None' in the
.exitCode property, and the signal number in the .signal property. The
instance also has a useful str() representation if you just want to log
a sensible error message.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Conch as a file transfer server
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=LieWCiKz37OWw=r01b8OOSqLD1xCWXu-=PT1_@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!


I've figured out vaguely how to use Conch as a file transfer client
thanks to the cftp script. I'm currently trying to adapt the simple
SSH server script example (link below) to do file *serving*. I can't
find any example code that actually does this or documentation on this
subject.

There's conch's test_filetransfer which indeed does have some server
parts, but being unit tests they gloss over a lot of the things I
think I need to know to get this working for an actual file server.
For example, what's the difference between SSHSession and ISession?
They both appear to be 'sessions' in the SSH sense. Why does ISession
not do anything about subsystems? Do I need one if I'm just using a
subsystem and not opening a shell? If so: is it just a stub, or does
it need to implement behavior? I would guess it's just stubs, since
invoking subsystems does not mean opening a shell.

link to the example:
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/conch/examples/index.html#auto0

Ideally, does anyone have any code somewhere that actually serves a file?

thanks in advance,
lvh

I don't have minimal code, but in the Launchpad tree there are two
SFTP servers, written with Conch.

$ bzr co lp:launchpad
Look in lib/lp/services/sshserver for the common code;
lib/lp/codehosting/sshserver for one implementation; lib/lp/poppy for
another.

Alternatively:
  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~launchpad-pqm/launchpad/db-devel/files/head:/lib/lp/codehosting/sshserver/
  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~launchpad-pqm/launchpad/db-devel/files/head:/lib/lp/services/

Hope this helps,

FWIW, I found a workaround. The remote machine had setuptools-0.6c11-py2.6.egg, the local machine setuptools-0.6c9-py2.6.egg. Reverting to c9 prevents Carbon to be loaded with pkg_resources, which in turn enables daemonisation. The child happily runs twisted and quartz.

I'd still be interested to see how twisted / daemon / OSX API  is supposed to work with setuptools c11. But I'm happy I can continue.

Well, clearly it doesn't work :).

Please feel free to open another ticket.  You are correct in saying that this is related to <http://tm.tl/4644>, but that ticket is specifically about a test, and the proposed solution there is to make the test sensitive.

<http://bugs.python.org/issue7895> was the bug in Python that causes this, which has since been fixed. Although apparently the fix was not quite in time for 2.7, it looks to me like it has been committed to the 2.7 (and 2.6) branches, so perhaps we will see some point-releases which fix it.  So in future versions of Python, Twisted will not be affected by this issue.

However, it may be good to get a workaround in Twisted anyway, for those who have to deal with the combination of older Python / newer Setuptools, or a better fix, like changing the order of daemonization.  So a ticket is definitely worthwhile.

Okay, tried to learn something out of that. If I understand correctly
SSHSession is the low-level thing that actually handles SSH-specific
gunk, and ISession is the customizable thing. File transfer was
implemented separately. When something wants file transfer, Conch
tries to adapt the avatar to ISFTPServer instead of ISession. Is that
right?

I've found code that does both (adaptation of a ConchUser
implementation to ISFTPServer and ISession) in unix.py.

Yeah, that sounds right, although I'm not going to look up the code to
double check.

You want the ISession around to handle non-SFTP connections: shell
requests, command exec etc.

If I understand correctly, the avatar knows about requestable
subsystems, and SSHSession is the low-level magic required to make
them work.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] twisted daemonize problem
Message-ID: <ib8vbu$emb$1@dough.gmane.org>

I try to daemonize twisted, but it uses 100% cpu.

The problem occurs in this code:

def daemonize(log_stdout=False, out_name=None, log_stderr=False, 
err_name=None):
    """
    Turn current process into a daemon
    """
    pid = os.fork()

        os.setsid()
        maxfd = os.sysconf("SC_OPEN_MAX")
        for fd in range(0, maxfd):
            try:
                os.close(fd)
            except OSError:   # ERROR (ignore)
                pass

        # Redirect the standard file descriptors to /dev/null.  <<<< HERE's 
THE PROBLEM
        os.open("/dev/null", os.O_RDONLY)    # standard input (0)
        os.open("/dev/null", os.O_RDWR)       # standard output (1)
        os.open("/dev/null", os.O_RDWR)       # standard error (2)


        if (not out_name):
            out_name = gen_name() + '.out'
        if (not err_name):
            err_name = gen_name() + '.err'
        if (log_stdout):
            sys.stdout = logger.logger (out_name)
        if (log_stderr):
            sys.stderr = logger.logger (err_name)
    else:
        print "forked pid", pid
        sys.exit (0)


If I comment out the lines that open /dev/null, everything is OK, but with 
those lines the process uses 100% cpu.

The actual twisted code (not shown) is 
class Spawner(xmlrpc.XMLRPC):
...
    r = Spawner()
    reactor.listenTCP(7080, server.Site(r))
    reactor.run()

This is on linux.

Because it looks like I need to learn a lot more to use it.  But I'll try.

It's not difficult or long at all, at least you could read this[1]

I seem to have things working OK with twistd.

My app is a batch scheduling system that listens for commands via xmlrpc.  
It is very simple at this point, and I'm attaching it.  I would welcome any 
suggestions for improvement, since I'm a newb to twisted, and a lot of this 
was guesswork.

task.py is a seperate file because otherwise pickle doesn't work.  t6.tac is 
the server, and a toy client is client4.py.

If I could you give a suggestion on how to structure the server side of
your program:

The ``Task`` class in a separate file, this is fine, clients could
import the file without the need to import the non useful, for the
client, server code.

All the server logic in a file and a third file for the tap, here a
possible structure:

	procxmlrpc/
		|- client.py
		|- server.py
		`- task.py
	twisted/
		`- plugins/
			`- procxmlrpc_plugin.py

Here the simplified code, all the remaining code goes into ``server.py``

	from procxmlrpc.server import Spawner

	from twisted.web import server
	from twisted.application import service, internet

	application = service.Application("Demo application")
	spawn_server = server.Site(Spawner())
	service = internet.TCPServer(7080, spawn_server)
	service.setServiceParent(application)

Hi!

This should of course be avoided. On the other hand, it is convenient to
have the ability to define a maximum delay (and the name of the variable
suggests that the delay won't be any bigger).

Maybe it's better to change the calculation such that the random value
is always below maxDelay. If the first parameter to random.normalvariate
is adapted in the right way, the result should always be lower than 
maxDelay.

I'll create one, but leave open how to solve the inconsistency.

Best regards,

Thanks for the suggestions.

I'd also like to add authentication, but it seems rather daunting.

Maybe I could just restrict the xmlrpc to listen only on connection from the 
local host?

You should not. Add basic or digest authentication is really easy. Take
a look at Calderone's Twisted Web in 60 seconds: HTTP authentication[1],
I read the series time ago and I don't remember exactly the content but
the serie is really well written, the best 60 seconds (per episode)
spent to learn the bases of twisted web.

> Maybe I could just restrict the xmlrpc to listen only on connection from the 
> local host?

yes, you could and twisted tap plugin system helps you on this. Just
create a tap plugin with the options you need. An simple example:


	from twisted.python import usage
	from twisted.plugin import IPlugin
    from twisted.application import strports, service

	class Options(usage.Options):

		optParameters = [
				['port', 'p', '80', 'Listen port.', int],
				['interface', 'i', None, 'Interface to which to bind.'],
				]


	class ProcessXMLRPCServiceMaker(object):
		implements(service.IServiceMaker, IPlugin)
		tapname = "processxmlrpc"
		description = "Remote process control in xmlrpc"
		options = Options

		def makeService(self, options):
			factory = ... # XXX
			description = 'tcp:' + str(config['port'])
			if config['interface']:
				description += ':interface=' + config['interface']
			return strports.service(description, factory)


You can setup the server to listen to localhost and prepare a reverse
proxy that require authentication and that accept connections from all
interfaces, as example.

My simple batch processing system is moved here:

http://code.google.com/p/batch-queue/

Seems to be reasonably functional.  Any suggestions/contributions 
appreciated.

One thing todo is to add some authentication.  For now the server listens 
for xmlrpc requests and will run any command without authentication.  In my 
current environment (single user system, firewalled), that's not a fatal 
flaw.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] wxReactor Issues
Message-ID: <183F75F0C38.00000278rsgames@inbox.com>

Hello,
My Twisted Python application with wxReactor crashes every time the user exits the application. The OnClose event calls a method that does reactor.stop(). I've ran this through gdb, and have noticed that this is because 2 threads aren't getting closed. What I find strange though, that is if the server closes the connection to the user, the 2 threads exit, and you are able to close the application our properly. I have tried running reactor.disconnectAll() before the reactor.stop() in my OnClose event, with no luck. The client closes the connection to the server, but the threads do not exit. I have also this patch found here (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/3948):
if wxreactor.WxReactor.callFromThread is not None:
    oldStop = wxreactor.WxReactor.stop
    def stopFromThread(self):
        reactor.callFromThread(oldStop)
    wxreactor.WxReactor.stop = stopFromThread

This problem occurs when I do and don't call the MainLoop() on the wx.App(). If you all could provide some insight on this, I would be very grateful.
Thank you.

Hi,
Yes, I tried the code below with no luck.
The OnClose() event calls this:
def KillSock():
 if wxreactor.WxReactor.callFromThread is not None:
    oldStop = wxreactor.WxReactor.stop
    def stopFromThread(self):
        reactor.callFromThread(oldStop)
    wxreactor.WxReactor.stop = stopFromThread
 reactor.stop()

When I ran this code in gdb, it did not say the two threads exited like they should do.

Thank you.

What do you mean when you say "crashes"?  A SIGSEGV is probably due to a 
bug in CPython or (more likely) wxPython.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] ProcessProtocol stdin/stdout loop
Message-ID: <4CDFFB26.5050905@baudvine.net>

Hi all,

It appears that I have managed to loop a ProcessProtocol subclass's
transport.write() right back into its outReceived.  It's not directly
called, which leads me to believe that somehow stdin and stdout got tied
up.  Anything thrown at transport.write() doesn't appear to reach the
actual process.  I checked by running `cat > log` through it, the file
'log' is created but remains empty.

I am baffled, but will continue to poke at it.  In the meantime, I'd
love to hear if anyone has a clue as to what I might have messed up.

Thanks,

Forgot to mention that the ProcessProtocol instance does receive
whatever the process sends my way.

Can you provide a minimal, self-contained code example demonstrating

Hi,
Well, I close the application (by clicking the X). Then a few seconds later, Ubuntu comes up with a dialog asking me if I want to force quit the application. gdb reports the following when I force quit: Program terminated with signal SIGKILL, Killed.

As far as to why it is crashing, I'm almost positive it is because there are two threads that aren't getting stopped properly.
Thank you.

That's *not* "crashing", that's "not exiting". The SIGKILL is coming
from the forced kill. So the real issue is, it's not exiting, and it's
not exiting because, as you say, there's still threads running. Does
your program start/use any threads itself?

Hi,
Yes, it uses the speechd module on Linux (which uses a thread). The speechd module provided speech output for our visually impaired users. However, when I run the program without speechd at all, I still have this problem. I'm pretty sure it is wxreactor and not speechd that is causing this problem.
Thank you.

Hi,
I think the best way to debug this is to give you all the source code. You can find it here: http://bit.ly/doEiEJ

To give you all some background on this project: It is a freeware client that uses sockets to connect to a multiplayer game server (currently plays Monopoly and Uno). You will immediately notice there are no graphics. That is because this client only provides audio feedback through speech synthesis and sound effects. The target audience of this project is visually impaired gamers. 

To test the issue, run python rsg.py (which can be found in the src folder. In case you need to know, I use Python 2.6.5). In a terminal, you will see the output the program produces (which is mostly what the server sends to our client). Once you see the line "Connection Made" (which should print very shortly after running), try closing the program (by clicking the X). The client will hang for a few seconds, and then you will need to force quit the application (on Ubuntu, it comes up asking if I want to force quit the application). say

It should be noted that this issue does not occur on Windows, only on Linux (I've tested with Ubuntu) and Mac. 

Thank you.

This appears to be caused by nox's use of private Twisted APIs which no 
longer exist.  You can try installing an older version of Twisted or 
updating nox to work with the version you're using now.

Linux (Ubuntu 9.10)
Python 2.6.4
Twisted trunk at 30276
wxPython 2.8.10.1-0ubuntu1

The demo exits quickly when I click the window-manager provided close 
window button.

And, if you switch reactor.stop() with
reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop) you still have the problem? What
OS/wx/python/twisted version exhibits the issue for you?

Hello all,

I want to know how to test xml-rpc functions written using python-twisted. I
came across trial framework. But cant find proper information regarding

Can anyone provide info regarding this or sample unit test-case how to test
that.

Hi,
Thank you for the suggestion. Unfortunately, I still have this problem when I call the reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop). I have this problem with:
OS: Ubuntu 10.04
WX (python-wxgtk2.8): 2.8.10.1-0ubuntu1.2
Twisted: 10.0.0-2ubuntu2
Python: 2.6.5
Here is some output from gdb:

[New Thread 0x7fffe85c0710 (LWP 31903)]

-At this time, I try to close the program. It just sits there, and after a few seconds, Ubuntu prompts me to force quit.

Hi,
I have found something interesting. When I do not call sys.exit(), and just call this:  reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop), the program exits properly. I was wondering if it was safe to not call sys.exit()? If so I think the problem is fixed.
Thank you.

sys.exit() will raise an exception, SystemExit. It's certainly possible
that raising it will cause problems, though I wouldn't expect it to keep
threads from exiting. It's possible there's some race condition involved
that is less likely to happen due to this change. Regardless, You should
not call it if you're using Twisted (or if you do, it should be called
after reactor.run()).

Nope, that's not a "real" atfork: it only monkey-patches python's os.fork() function, so it doesn't catch any fork done by C code. So it's not good enough. (but of course, as mentioned previously, pthread_atfork itself isn't good enough either).

Message-ID: <476545CB486.000001A2rsgames@inbox.com>

Hi,
I have been using the following code to show the user a TextEntryDialog, that would allow users to enter data in, and press return. Since I've started using Twisted, this doesn't work on Mac OS X. The dialog pops up okay, but you can't actually enter any data into the box. The cursor does not appear. When I click inside the box to try to make it appear, it quickly disappears again.
def handle_input(data):
 prompt=data.replace("+INPUT ","")
 new=wx.TextEntryDialog(global_vars.frame, "", prompt)
 new.Raise()
 if new.ShowModal() == wx.ID_OK:
  socks.sockObj.sendData(new.GetValue())
 else:
  socks.sockObj.sendData("+~!?CANCEL?!~")
  new.Destroy()

Thank you.

You probably want to avoid modal dialogs (in any toolkit) when 
integrating with Twisted.  The require a reentrant mainloop to 
implement, and no Twisted reactor (ie, mainloop) is reentrant.

Whether or not the fact that this is a modal dialog is actually causing 
this particular problem, I don't know.

Hi,
Okay. Well that's not so great - these TextEntryDialogs are quite important to the program. Anyway on Windows and Linux, ShowModal() seems to work really well with wxreactor, and it is only Mac OS X that is the problem.
Thank you.

The key word here is "seems".  You will get weird errors on those platforms eventually, you just haven't yet.

Anyway, it's fine to use dialogs with Twisted.  The issue is APIs like ShowModal(), which expect to be able to block.  Instead you should be using Show(), and make your own API that returns a Deferred from your dialog.

Other toolkits allow you to show a modal dialog without blocking your whole program: for example, with GTK, you can pass the gtk.DIALOG_MODAL flag to gtk.Dialog, and then simply call gtk.Dialog.show_all() instead of gtk.Dialog.run().  wxwindows appears to incorrectly conflate the idea of a modal dialog with a particular type of control flow.

(In my personal opinion, modal dialogs are terrible UI anyway, and should be avoided.  You should be able to prompt the user without interrupting everything else they're doing in the program.)

I agree for 99% of dialogs, but modal dialogs actually make sense for a 
few things.  For example, the "Do you really want to quit the program 
without saving?" dialog in many editors.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimVEkQ7LZ90HC3KgrgiH3_pKPbmAKGjKrp4BBG8@mail.gmail.com>

Despite a brief and unsuccessful attempt by Canadian forces to wrest control
of the Twisted release process, it continues.  The francophone domination of
North America may be inevitable, but it won't happen today.  Coming to you
from an ominous tower above Cambridge, Massachusetts, Twisted 10.2.0,
pre-release 3, is here!

You may - and should! - retrieve it from <
http://twistedmatrix.com/users/glyph/10.2.0pre3/>.

To avoid any further delays in getting this release out, we will be keeping
to a tight schedule.  Unless there are any undiscovered, unfixed regressions
from 10.1.0,* the final release of Twisted 10.2.0 will be made on November
29, 2010.  That is **one week from today.*

**Developers, please install the release now and test with your
applications, so you won't be caught off guard when the final release is
made.

This new pre-release includes important bugfixes and several exciting new
features.  Just since the previous prerelease:

   - A new, simpler, *substantially* more robust CoreFoundation reactor.
   http://tm.tl/1833
   - A plug-in API for adding new types of endpoint descriptions.
   http://tm.tl/4695

Other highlights, since the 10.1 release:

   - Improvements to the implementation of Deferred which should both
   improve performance and fix certain runtime errors with long callback
   chains. http://tm.tl/411
   - Deferred.setTimeout is (finally) gone.  http://tm.tl/1702
   - NetstringReceiver is substantially faster. http://tm.tl/4378

Thanks to everyone who worked on the release automation tools, for making
this release possible.  I can guarantee that if I had to spend a moment
longer on it, it wouldn't have gotten done.

Hi,

I am trying to package it on OpenBSD, and there are quite a number of
regression tests that don't pass there: failures, errors, busy loops,
... 10.0.0 was almost ok in this regard (I slacked on 10.1.0...)
I'm looking into these issues, and I will create tickets for those.

Starting now: http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4747

Eric.

So in my opinion, the function should really return the list of actually
opened files in all cases, and not fallback to a list of possible
list, otherwise
the test case makes no sense. Of course this means trying all fds as last resort
on platforms that don't provide a simpler way to do it.  Doing it there or
doing it by ignoring EBADF on close() later would be the same, as far as
"suboptimization" is concerned.

Another (nicer?) possibility to achieve the "close non standard fds" would be
to use closefrom().

No, it's much worse :)
While trying to fix the issue, I was surpised to notice that python had 5 opened
fds by default here... After digging a bit further, I found out it is
actually due to
python being linked with libpthread, which installs a pair of pipe at init...

For the general case no, but for the intended purpose I'd say use closefrom()

Eric.

Maybe so.  Fortunately the problem really seems only to be with the 
_test_, right?  On OpenBSD the fallback case will really be used, and 
the file descriptors we want to close will be closed?

Right, and this is just what should happen on OpenBSD now.

Hopefully these are already marked as CLOEXEC, or lots of people would 
already be having lots of problems with them.  Despite that, they should 
be closed by `reactor.spawnProcess` (because that doesn't hurt and it's 
simpler than checking for CLOEXEC).  Then the only problem is that they 
are recreated in the child process and mess up the test's assumptions.

Perhaps another approach to testing this function would be to create a 
file descriptor and assert that:

  - That file descriptor is not open in the child process
  - stdin, stdout, and sterr are open in the child process

Only, without some care, one of the pthread pipe fds might end up 
looking like the probe descriptor, so maybe that can't really work.

closefrom() doesn't appear to help.  Descriptors intended to be kept 
open may be mixed together with descriptors which must be closed.  This 
is because of the `childFDs` parameter to `reactor.spawnProcess`, which 
allows arbitrary file descriptors to be passed to the child.

Well, actually no... On bsd, the /dev/* files are statically created. So as it
is now, it picks the 64 existing /dev/fd/* files, which is not correct
since higher
fd with a higher number will never be found. This is getting tricky. So if one
can't trust /dev/fd/ on some platform, maybe it should not be tried at all,
or we need to find a way to know at runtime/configure time if this is safe...

That is closer to what the test is really about : spawnProcess don't leave
an undesired fd opened.

Right, I overlooked that.

Oh, I have just thought of another way to test all opened fds in just
one syscall.
It goes like this:

import resource
import select

_poll = [ 0, None ]

def listOpenFDs():
        maxfd = resource.getrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_NOFILE)[0]
        if maxfd != _poll[0]:
                _poll[0] = maxfd
                _poll[1] = select.poll()
                for fd in xrange(maxfd):
                        _poll[1].register(fd)
        return [ d for (d, r) in _poll[1].poll() if r != select.POLLNVAL ]

Hi Eric,

Thanks for participating in the release process!  It's very satisfying to actually get some feedback in response to a prerelease ;).

If OpenBSD were a supported platform, a bug like this would cause the release process to stop until it could be addressed; as it is, we will try to merge a bugfix into the release branch if it is available and reviewed in time (before next Monday).  Being a supported platform means that there's a buildbot, and that it shows up on this page: <http://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/boxes-supported>.  Of course, if OpenBSD were a supported platform, this bug never would have been introduced in the first place, because we would have noticed failing tests immediately!

Does anyone feel like contributing an OpenBSD buildslave, and hopefully also some more expertise for fixing bugs on that platform?  Or, for that matter, any other *BSDs?

Sure. I have a couple of test machines for OpenBSD (amd64 and sparc64)
that are mostly idling, and that could be used for that. I just need
to know the procedure for setting up a buildbot, and I'll see what I
can do.  That would surely help me with the port maintainance.

Eric.

That'd be great.  The machines need to be online basically 100% of the 
time, and be able to make an outgoing TCP connection.  Other than that, 
they'll stay idle except when someone commits to trunk or wants to try 
out a branch before merging.  You can find more detailed instructions on 
the wiki:

Subject: [Twisted-Python] ANNOUNCING Tahoe, the Least-Authority File System,
	v1.8.1
Message-ID: <AANLkTinU=MMyMFP+aOeC8aA05QsOt0v8R6FvEoX0Sk6v@mail.gmail.com>

Folks:

Tahoe-LAFS uses Twisted extensively, and we try to contribute a few
patches back to Twisted itself when we can.

Regards,

Zooko


ANNOUNCING Tahoe, the Least-Authority File System, v1.8.1

The Tahoe-LAFS team is pleased to announce the immediate
availability of version 1.8.1 of Tahoe-LAFS, an extremely
reliable distributed storage system. Get it here:

http://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe/trunk/docs/quickstart.html

Tahoe-LAFS is the first distributed storage system to offer
"provider-independent security" — meaning that not even the
operators of your storage servers can read or alter your data
without your consent. Here is the one-page explanation of its
unique security and fault-tolerance properties:

http://tahoe-lafs.org/source/tahoe/trunk/docs/about.html

The previous stable release of Tahoe-LAFS was v1.8.0, which was
released September 23, 2010 [1].

v1.8.1 is a stable bugfix release correcting a number of minor
issues. It also includes a modest performance improvement in
downloading, and a fix for a security issue involving HTTP
proxies. See the NEWS file [2] for details.


WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?

With Tahoe-LAFS, you distribute your filesystem across
multiple servers, and even if some of the servers fail or are
taken over by an attacker, the entire filesystem continues to
work correctly, and continues to preserve your privacy and
security. You can easily share specific files and directories
with other people.

In addition to the core storage system itself, volunteers
have built other projects on top of Tahoe-LAFS and have
integrated Tahoe-LAFS with existing systems, including
Windows, JavaScript, iPhone, Android, Hadoop, Flume, Django,
Puppet, bzr, mercurial, perforce, duplicity, TiddlyWiki, and
more. See the Related Projects page on the wiki [3].

We believe that strong cryptography, Free and Open Source
Software, erasure coding, and principled engineering practices
make Tahoe-LAFS safer than RAID, removable drive, tape,
on-line backup or cloud storage.

This software is developed under test-driven development, and
there are no known bugs or security flaws which would
compromise confidentiality or data integrity under recommended
use. (For all important issues that we are currently aware of
please see the known_issues.rst file [4].)


COMPATIBILITY

This release is compatible with the version 1 series of
Tahoe-LAFS. Clients from this release can write files and
directories in the format used by clients of all versions back
to v1.0 (which was released March 25, 2008). Clients from this
release can read files and directories produced by clients of
all versions since v1.0. Servers from this release can serve
clients of all versions back to v1.0 and clients from this
release can use servers of all versions back to v1.0.

This is the twelfth release in the version 1 series. This
series of Tahoe-LAFS will be actively supported and maintained
for the forseeable future, and future versions of Tahoe-LAFS
will retain the ability to read and write files compatible
with this series.


LICENCE

You may use this package under the GNU General Public License,
version 2 or, at your option, any later version. See the file
"COPYING.GPL" [5] for the terms of the GNU General Public
License, version 2.

You may use this package under the Transitive Grace Period
Public Licence, version 1 or, at your option, any later
version. (The Transitive Grace Period Public Licence has
requirements similar to the GPL except that it allows you to
delay for up to twelve months after you redistribute a derived
work before releasing the source code of your derived work.)
See the file "COPYING.TGPPL.html" [6] for the terms of the
Transitive Grace Period Public Licence, version 1.

(You may choose to use this package under the terms of either
licence, at your option.)


INSTALLATION

Tahoe-LAFS works on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Cygwin, Solaris,
*BSD, and probably most other systems. Start with
"docs/quickstart.html" [7].


HACKING AND COMMUNITY

Please join us on the mailing list [8]. Patches are gratefully
accepted -- the RoadMap page [9] shows the next improvements
that we plan to make and CREDITS [10] lists the names of people
who've contributed to the project. The Dev page [11] contains
resources for hackers.


SPONSORSHIP

Tahoe-LAFS was originally developed by Allmydata, Inc., a
provider of commercial backup services. After discontinuing
funding of Tahoe-LAFS R&D in early 2009, they continued
to provide servers, bandwidth, small personal gifts as tokens
of appreciation, and bug reports.

Google, Inc. sponsored Tahoe-LAFS development as part of the
Google Summer of Code 2010. They awarded four sponsorships to
students from around the world to hack on Tahoe-LAFS that
summer.

Thank you to Allmydata and Google for their generous and
public-spirited support.


HACK TAHOE-LAFS!

If you can find a security flaw in Tahoe-LAFS which is serious
enough that we feel compelled to warn our users and issue a fix,
then we will award you with a customized t-shirts with your
exploit printed on it and add you to the "Hack Tahoe-LAFS Hall
Of Fame" [12].


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This is the sixth release of Tahoe-LAFS to be created solely
as a labor of love by volunteers. Thank you very much to the
team of "hackers in the public interest" who make Tahoe-LAFS
possible.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] twisted.web,
	url -> resource mapping and isLeaf questions
Message-ID: <4CF49495.502@silveregg.co.jp>

Hi,

I am following "twisted in 60sec" series, but even the simple examples 
are a bit unclear to me, especially w.r.t. url mapping. For example:

# assume the right imports...
class MainPage(Resource):
     isLeaf = True
     def render_GET(self, request):
         return "somestring"

resource = MainPage()
factory = Site(resource)
reactor.listenTCP(8880, factory)
reactor.run()

I was expecting that accessing any other 'path' besides the main url 
would cause 404, e.g. "http://localhost:8880/foo/bar", and I get the 
same page instead.

I gather this is a consequence of the isLeaf setting set to be True, 
because twisted.web stops as soon as it encounters MainPage in the 
hierarchy and use that for rendering. Setting it to False seems to avoid 
the page to be available at all. The solution I got instead is something 
like:

class RootPage(Resource):
     isLeaf = False
     def render(self, request):
         return "somestring"

     def getChild(self, path, request):
         if path:
             return NoResource()
         else:
             return self

and adding new resources through putChild. Isn't there a more natural 
way of doing things ?

cheers,

David

Subject: [Twisted-Python] [ANNOUNCE] Twisted 10.2.0 Released
Message-ID: <48EF5F73-CAE0-43CC-89A9-FD273C334E79@twistedmatrix.com>

Twisted 10.2.0, the third Twisted release of 2010, has emerged from the mysterious depths of Twisted Matrix Labs, as so many releases before it.  Survivors of the release process - what few there were of them - have been heard to claim that this version is "awesome", "even more robust", "fun-sized" and "oven fresh".

Crossing several things that shouldn't ought to be, including the streams and the rubicon, I have assumed the triple responsibilities of feature author, project leader, *and* release manager for 10.2: with this dark and terrible power - a power which no man ought to wield alone - I have wrought a release which contains many exciting new features, including:

    - A plug-in API for adding new types of endpoint descriptions. <http://tm.tl/4695>
    - A new, simpler, substantially more robust CoreFoundation reactor.  <http://tm.tl/1833>
    - Improvements to the implementation of Deferred which should both improve performance
      and fix certain runtime errors with long callback chains. <http://tm.tl/411>
    - Deferred.setTimeout is (finally) gone.  To quote the author of this change:
      "A new era of peace has started."  <http://tm.tl/1702>
    - NetstringReceiver is substantially faster. <http://tm.tl/4378>

And, of course, nearly one hundred smaller bug fixes, documentation updates, and general improvements.  See the NEWS file included in the release for more details.

Look upon our Twisted, ye mighty, and make your network applications event-driven: get it now, from:

... or simply install the 'Twisted' package from PyPI.

Many thanks to Christopher Armstrong, for his work on release-automation tools that made this possible; to Jonathan Lange, for thoroughly documenting the process and thereby making my ascent to the throne of release manager possible, and to Jean-Paul Calderone for his tireless maintenance of our build and test infrastructure as well as his help with the release.

Most of all, thanks to everyone who contributed a patch, reported a bug or reviewed a ticket for 10.2.  Not including those already thanked, there are 41 of you, so it would be a bit tedious to go through everyone, but you know who you are and we absolutely couldn't do it without you!  Thanks a ton!

No.

I'm not sure what you're asking here; it seems like you've figured out the resource model.  It has some rough edges, which we are trying to eventually fix (see, for example, <http://tm.tl/3621>).  But the things you're talking about are just how it works; <http://example.com/> is a collection, just like <http://example.com/foo/>, so it behaves in a consistent way.

It was not obvious to me I figured it out, I guess :)

I did not know there was a twisted.web specific list - will refer to 
that list from now on,

cheers,

	newbie alert )
Message-ID: <BA36A84D-8DEC-4D45-9834-B02157B3AAAF@optonline.net>

Hi,

I am using a Perspective Broker to service requests from a client on the same machine ( Windows XP ). This works fine most of the time however occasionally I see strange behaviour. The client uses connectTCP and provides a timeout of 5 seconds. Logging indicates that the client attempts to make a connection to the server, server logging in the remote methods indicates that the method is not called. Also my error callback on the client is not invoked after the timeout period. Unfotunately this is part of a large system, sporadic behaviour and difficult to generate a test case for.

Also commonly requests a few seconds before and after the issue are handled correctly so the behaviour seems transient. We are using a older version ot twisted 8.x. Any pointers?

Regards.

I've seen strange sporadic errors with networking in 8.x that weren't
there in 2.5.0, so would you be able to test it with 2.5.0?

Peter.

Better yet, why not test with a recent release?  Something that starts with '10'?  There's a reason we keep doing new releases, you know: bugs get fixed :).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Handling of NMEA messages
Message-ID: <20101129120148.GB11887@weiermayer.com>

Hi!

We are working on a project that has to extract weather information from 
an NMEA stream. There is a NMEAReceiver class, but it only extracts GPS 
information - as expected, since the class is defined in t.p.gps.nmea.

We intend to add the NMEA-0183 messages necessary for my purposes. The
question is: should we just extend the NMEAReceiver? Weather information
is not exactly what one would expect in a class below t.p.gps...

On the other hand, it would be strange to create a different kind of
NMEAReceiver which knows how to handle the messages dealing with
weather data.

Best regards,

Albert
