<PRE>I'm still a little confused about exactly how to deal with errors and
responses using protocols and factories. I think a lot of my
misunderstanding stems from the fact that I'm using serial (and
inter-process) communications, both of which Twisted treats rather
differently from TCP based connections &#8212; and all of the documentation
is TCP-centric.

Anyway, say I have a serial device that I send a single-line command
to, and expect a certain format of response. There are about a hundred
possible commands, but they all follow the same pattern, so I have a
CommandProtocol (some details omitted):

    class CommandProtocol(LineOnlyReceiver, TimeoutMixin):

        # For LineOnlyReceiver
        MAX_LENGTH = 20

        def parseReply(self, line):
            if line[0:4] != self.command:
                raise CommandReplyError(self.command, self.line)

            # Parse rest of response
            return reply

        def lineReceived(self, line):
            self.setTimeout(None)
            try:
                reply = self.parseReply(line)
            except:
                # ...?
            else:
                self.factory.commandCompleted(reply)
                # ...maybe?
            finally:
                self.loseConnection()

        def connectionMade(self):
            self.sendLine(self.construct_message())
            self.setTimeout(self.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT)

So I can then write a factory with a buildProtocol method that takes
an object with the command string, sets the appropriate attributes on
the protocol, and returns that for use with the SerialPort transport.

Peticolas' tutorial[1] shows the protocol calling a factory method
when the correct data is received. I understand that part fine. But as
far as I can tell, all the error handling relies on the
ClientFactory's clientConnectionFailed method &#8212; and I have no idea
when or how this is triggered. I *am* under the impression that it
won't ever be triggered on a SerialTransport, though, which means it
won't work for me.

[1] <A HREF="https://github.com/jdavisp3/twisted-intro/blob/master/twisted-client-8/get-poetry.py#L64">https://github.com/jdavisp3/twisted-intro/blob/master/twisted-client-8/get-poetry.py#L64</A>

What should my protocol do if there's an error? I notice that
protocols like LineReceiver and NetstringReceiver just silently ignore
such problems and let whatever handles connection failures sort it
out; but again, this won't work for a serial transport. Even
explicitly calling &quot;loseConnection&quot; won't trigger a subsequent
&quot;connectionLost&quot; call.

So how should I handle reply parsing errors, timeouts,
LineReceiver-internal errors (eg. a too-long line) and whatever else
might happen?

One approach I considered was for my factory to pass my protocol a
deferred. The factory would chain another deferred to this one which
it could return to the caller. The protocol could then callback or
errback *it's* deferred with a result or error. I know how to
implement this, but I see that none of the protocols in Twisted (or
any of the examples, or the tutorials) do anything like this &#8212; it's
all just assembly and disassembly of the data and a call to a factory
method. This makes me think that I'm doing it wrong. There's also the
fact that protocol errors will be handled inconsistently: errors in
*my* parsing methods will show up to callers of the factory methods,
but errors in Twisted's parsing will pass silently.

Another thing I could do is to have something like:

    def lineReceived(self, line):
        try:
            reply = self.parseReply(line)
        except:
            self.factory.commandFailed(failure.Failure())
        # ...other stuff from above

But again, this is inconsistent, and I've not seen anything else in
Twisted doing it this way.

So how I do I deal with protocol errors in a connectionless protocol?

Cheers,
Jason
