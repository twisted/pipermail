There's a connectionMade event when you do SerialPort(protocol, ...).
There's no connectionLost event, even if you do that over and over
again.

Should I? I don't know. My problem is, as a newbie, I *just don't
know* what the usual way to approach a problem like this is. Or if
there is one.

So, please help me think this through... let's say I have this
long-lasting protocol. It needs to keep a DeferredLock, so it doesn't
try to send one message before it's received the reply for another —
right? It should have a method for sending a command that returns a
Deferred, that will eventually fire with the response (parsed and
converted as necessary, that bit's easy). The bit I have trouble with
is that the *origin* of the Deferred callback or errback is the
&quot;lineReceived&quot; method — somehow this method needs to know which
Deferred to callback with the response. But how?

Here's a sketch:

    class CommandProtocol(LineReceiver, TimeoutMixin):

        def __init__(self):
            self.lock = DeferredLock()

        def _runCommand(self, command):
            message = self.constructMessage(command)
            self.sendLine(message)

        def runCommand(self, command):
            d = self.lock.run(self._runCommand, command)
            d.addCallback(command.parseResponse)
            return d

Where does the bit go that fires the Deferred? Should I set it in
_runCommand somehow? I just can't seem to picture it.

Thanks,
Jason

PS. Twisted has great documentation for its individual components, but
as soon as you get into anything that doesn't centre around
&quot;reactor.connectTCP&quot;, it seems like you're in the dark. All of the
examples and tutorials seem to have near-trivial, completely
synchronous protocols, requiring no back-and-forth or error handling.
Ultimately I'd like to take all of this advice, have an epiphany,
finish my project, bundle my new-found wisdom up into a neat little
package of things I think would make serial comms a happier experience
for all, and publish it somewhere. And maybe write about how to use
Twisted for non-internetty things. But I do need to actually
accomplish something first.
