I just wanted to point out that I agree with James' position too, but  
was speaking towards the &quot;what if ideas from Twisted were to be  
included&quot;, rather than &quot;what should actually happen&quot;.

Python's standard library should dissolve into just the bits required  
to support simple scripts and EasyInstall/eggs.
