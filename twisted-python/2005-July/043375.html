A fringe benefit of having something reactor-like in the Python  
stdlib is that it gives Twisted more credibility (amongst those that  
don't already know that we're right).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right.  But, her code uses Twisted-like interfaces so she doesn't

</I>&gt;<i> are trivial one-offs, this step will not always happen.
</I>
If something like threadedselectreactor made it into stdlib, then GUI  
integration (and integration with otherwise blocking code) would be  
easy enough.

Personally, since this is the 2.5+ timeframe we're talking about  
here, I would rather see something PEP-342 based on the outside, as  
that would require less brain enhancement for most people to use  
properly.

Deferreds are just as important as anything else.. I mean hell, I  
have implemented the Deferred API (with cancellation) in both  
JavaScript and ActionScript 2.0 for various purposes because it's the  
Right Way to represent that sort of thing given the language  
constraints.

(the JavaScript stuff, which should make a lot of Pythonistas very  
happy, will probably make it into open source in 2 weeks or so.. the  
AS2 stuff I have no immediate plans of releasing).
