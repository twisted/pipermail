I think adding a subset of Twisted to the python stdlib would be a  
disservice to both the stdlib users and Twisted users, especially now  
that Python is on the cusp of having an easy way to distribute, find,  
and install 3rd party packages automatically. Saying that Twisted  
should be a &quot;starting point&quot; bothers me especially, as that seems to  
indicate that the two will diverge over time. That is worrisome. Who  
is going to maintain the stdlib fork?

I would suggest instead that python should distribute a selected set  
of &quot;recommended extras&quot; as part of the installer, which would  
basically be complete 3rd party packages, included just for  
convenience. Twisted core would make a good package to include there,  
as would many others.
