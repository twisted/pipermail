<PRE>Hello all...

I thought this might be of interest to a few people... I know there are some 
game developers on this list... and we have a pretty good example of Twisted 
being used in a game :)

We just opened up the alpha on our RPG that uses Twisted for the bulk of 
it's &quot;RPG Networking&quot;... Twisted has been absolutely great to work with... 
it's used in our Master Server, World Server, Zone Servers, and Client... We 
also have an autopatching system it will be used in, though for now that 
uses *gulp* urllib :|

The alpha can be downloaded on both the Windows and OSX platforms.... some 
further information is below....

Oh, and here's an embedded web server in the world server running Nevow, 
hooray for Nevow! <A HREF="http://www.prairiegames.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=116">http://www.prairiegames.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=116</A>

Vibes and THANKS!!!,
