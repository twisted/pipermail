I agree with James's position:  Twisted should be one of a number
of Python &quot;recommended extras&quot; (I also agree with Glyph and Itamar
that asyncore should be deprecated).

IMO, that approach accomplishes everything that could be hoped
for by incorporating a reactor-like event loop in the std library:
(1) makes Twisted more visible to anyone looking for a &quot;simple,
flexible event loop&quot;, and (equally important) add the context of
the deferred api and some well-tested goodies with asynchronous
api's (like adbapi) and (2) does not create any gratuitous wrinkles
(like a potential stdlib fork) for the current well-oiled Twisted
development machine's minions to have to deal with.  ;)

Bob's point about &quot;credibility&quot; is well-taken, but I think having
Twisted designated as an official Python &quot;recommended extra&quot;
would accomplish that as well.

Cheers,
Steve
