That's a nice idea, but it can't possibly work.  If you want a  
general way to interoperate with different toolkits, you basically  
have to use multithreaded fanciness, because not many of them have  
timers or socket notifiers built in worth their salt.  Starting a  
single thread to sit around and wait for select() or equivalent is  
pretty sane, and makes the interface a lot more flexible and generic  
since you only need one facility in the toolkit -- namely a thread- 
safe way to call back into the main thread.

Fortunately, there is one in Twisted 2.1, threadedselectreactor,  
which DOES integrate with various runloops (pygame and wxPython  
included) without polling.  However, it's not the end of the road.   
threadedselectreactor should be refactored into a general interface  
(interleave) such that other backends (epoll, kqueue, windows junk,  
etc.) can be used rather than select.
