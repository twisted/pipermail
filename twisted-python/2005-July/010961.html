<PRE>Hi all,

I'm starting to work on a new server application, and I think Twisted
may be a useful platform to build on.  I've been having a hard time
figuring out where to start, though, as my experience is mostly in
database-backed web applications and Twisted seems rather large.  I
found myself wishing there was an O'Reilly book on Twisted, and was
happy to read the message below on the mailing list.

Abe, is there any way a newbie like me can get (or buy) a pre-print of
your book?

Can anyone recommend other resources or tutorials for newbies?  The
documentation on the Twisted website was confusing, in part because
it's divided into many different projects and I don't know how those
projects relate or if some of them have been superseded by newer ones.

thanks,
Shimon Rura

</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy to announce that O'Reilly is going to publish my book on

</I>&gt;<i> Twisted Network Programming Essentials.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For a description of what the book covers (and what it doesn't), see

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks to all the Twisted developers for creating such an amazing
</I>&gt;<i> framework. The more I learn about Twisted (and I learned a lot while
</I>&gt;<i> writing this book), the more I'm impressed. I hope this book helps many
</I>&gt;<i> more people to get started with Twisted, and that it's the first of many
</I>&gt;<i> more books to come.
