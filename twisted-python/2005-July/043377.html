Alternatively, asyncore could just be deprecated, which would be a lot
easier to do, and people would start from the correct solution :)

Hm. That's a lot better than moving parts of Twisted, yes. I still think
it's silly.

&gt;<i> I don't think the issue is &quot;less&quot; or &quot;more&quot; but &quot;better&quot;.  The Python 
</I>&gt;<i> standard library is of a highly non-uniform quality.  Whether or not

</I>&gt;<i> strongly deprecated.
</I>
Adding yet another event loop would just continue the tradition, I'm
sure; it took us quite a while to get to the quality we have now just in
terms of platform support. I suppose you could butcher our code by
ripping features out... but you'd just get a crippled piece of software.
The motivation is &quot;so then people can move to something less suck&quot;? Why
not just have them start from something good to begin with?
