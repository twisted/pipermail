The CVS version of Twisted now has a glossary in the docs -- the idea
being that you'd be able to say &quot;Perspective Broker?  What the hell is
that?  &lt;check glossary&gt;... Oh, ok, that's something else, so I can
ignore that...&quot;.  I'd be interested to know if it really is useful for
you?

&gt;<i> documentation roadmap (&quot;If you are trying to do XXX, then start with
</I>&gt;<i> documents YYY, ZZZ&quot;) would be useful. Your suggestions certainly got

</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;I want to implement a *news* server, specifically&quot;.
</I>
Of course, then there's all the variations -- &quot;I want to implement a
{mail,web,finger,etc} server&quot; -- which is an awful lot of documentation.
If you'd like to help us by writing a the &quot;I want to implement a news
server&quot; doc, that would help alot :)
