I don't quite get what you're talking about here.  You want the URLs to be
shell command-lines? :)

   In the case that a profile explicitly permits multiple successful SASL
   negotiations to occur, then in no case may multiple security layers be
   simultaneously in effect.  If a security layer is in effect and a subsequent
   SASL negotiation selects no security layer, the original security layer
   remains in effect.  If a security layer is in effect and a subsequent SASL
   negotiation selects a second security layer, then the second security layer
   replaces the first.

I understand that there are considerations where authentication is bound up in
link-layer security (public key crypto) but for most cases I'd like to keep
them separate so you can authenticate to multiple objects requiring different
authentication conversations in the same session.

&gt;<i> 	What part talks about TCP/UNIX/etc? service? Then it needs more

</I>
Same as with HTTP:
    <A HREF="pb://pyramid/service">pb://pyramid/service</A> == pb-<A HREF="tcp://pyramid/service">tcp://pyramid/service</A>
    pb-<A HREF="ssl://pyramid/service">ssl://pyramid/service</A>
    pb-unix:/foo/<A HREF="bar://service">bar://service</A>

&gt;<i> &gt;     <A HREF="pb://pyramid/identity:password@service#perspective">pb://pyramid/identity:password@service#perspective</A>
</I>
&gt;<i> 	Eww. Passwords in URLs is baaad. Because users like to enter URLs on
</I>&gt;<i> 	command line.
</I>
&gt;<i> 	I'd much rather see an explicit &quot;--password-file filename&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> 	&quot;--password-fd n&quot;.
</I>
Yes, and smart users will use that, for the most part.  Still, you need a way
to represent simple authentication as part of a URL.  Sometimes the URLs
themselves will be secret and the authentication information will be a swiss
number or something.  E does everything through exchange of URLs, and it's
pretty secure.

&gt;<i> &gt; Public-key authentication mechanism, using the same identity name.  Connection
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; over SSH transport (sshkey auth only available this way).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PB over SSL, using certificate auth.

&gt;<i> 	Hmm. Idea. Allow one to specify when the server is trusted.  &quot;Connect
</I>&gt;<i> 	to server X if its public key has fingerprint F.&quot;  <A HREF="http://www.fs.net/">http://www.fs.net/</A>
</I>
Any proposals for how to implement that?

&gt;<i> &gt; [ ... ]
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt;     - &lt;img /&gt; or &lt;object /&gt; tags that automatically download other items, which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       may be webpages containing javascript.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, don't allow these tags.  Or, have the server-side site download the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; images and verify that they are PNGs (alternately also doing PIL stuff to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remove steganographic information, if you're _really_ paranoid).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Your basic problem here is that you are trying to disallow
</I>&gt;<i> 	things you know are not safe. That assumes you are omnipotent.
</I>                                                           ^

I assume you mean &quot;omniscient&quot;.  If I were omnipotent, I would smite skript
kiddies with lightning from the sky, and forget about all this software-level
security :)

&gt;<i> 	While not contesting that, I still feel the only sane architecture is
</I>&gt;<i> 	to catalogue known safe things, and only allow those. Something like a
</I>&gt;<i> 	DTD/schema should do the job.
</I>
Okay, you have a point.  Still, it is useful to know which are potentially
problematic so that we can allow the usage of things like IMG with appropriate
warnings and links that remove session privileges first.

&gt;<i> &gt; Even if I managed to get this right for the web, though, trying to avoid lock
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in to the web's way of thinking about forms is very tricky!  I have yet to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seriously think about how GTK, PyUI, or Tkinter would work with this.  I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spent a little while thinking about how a text-based virtual world interface in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; twisted reality, though, and that should be pretty easy (building a machine
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with dials, knobs, etc, and a big button for &quot;submit&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	IMHO, form-based GUIs suck horribly. A GUI is good only if
</I>&gt;<i> 	it is interactive -- dynamic in some way. Most of the current
</I>&gt;<i> 	GUIs only try to reach rich with forms that change
</I>&gt;<i> 	dynamically.
</I>
&gt;<i> 	Have you ever used mc-foo fan? While certainly not the greatest GUI in
</I>&gt;<i> 	the world, imagine you had to use it through forms.
</I>
Some GUIs simply don't work with forms.

On the other hand, there's a large class of GUI that does.  In fact some might
say that most of the GUIs in the world are form-based.  If forms couldn't
represent a large number of things that people want to do when interacting with
a computer, then the web would have died an early death.

&gt;<i> &gt; squatting.  I think that by having a distributed naming system (where different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people call the &quot;python&quot; group different things, but <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at twistedmatrix.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will always get you to the one you're looking for) might circumvent squatting.
</I>
&gt;<i> 	So user A will see <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at python.org</A> as &quot;python&quot;, user B will see
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at twistedmatrix.com</A> as &quot;python&quot;, and if those two ever have to be
</I>&gt;<i> 	squashed to the same namespace, user A will see &quot;python
</I>&gt;<i> 	(<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at python.org</A>)&quot; and &quot;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at twistedmatrix.com</A>&quot; and user B will see
</I>&gt;<i> 	&quot;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at python.org</A>&quot; and &quot;python (<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at twistedmatrix.com</A>)&quot;?
</I>
This is how e-mail naming works, isn't it?  User A is connecting to python.org,
user B is connecting to twistedmatrix.com.  The difference is that hosts may
provide either redirects for a certain name between each other, or relays for a
particular channel (a-la ry).

&gt;<i> 	This problem may be easier to think of in terms of nicks than of
</I>&gt;<i> 	channels; IIRC there was some chat system that under the hood
</I>&gt;<i> 	identified users with <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">user at host</A> (unix user id / email, whatever), but
</I>&gt;<i> 	allowed them to set their list of &quot;preferred nicknames&quot;.  User A would
</I>&gt;<i> 	see user B with the first available preferred nickname from B's list,
</I>&gt;<i> 	or as <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">userB at hostB</A> if none was available. And this was, IIRC, done fully
</I>&gt;<i> 	in A's client; if B and C saw different people (were on different
</I>&gt;<i> 	channels), they could see A with a different nickname.
</I>
This is an interesting idea, but it has the potential to be pretty confusing, I
think.  Tacking on an implicit domain name to channel/user names is a
convenience, but shifting around the displayed name is potentially even more
confusing.  (At least: as I understand it, I was thinking the user would type
&quot;join python&quot; and get a window that says &quot;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at twistedmatrix.com</A>&quot;; what
you're suggesting is that the user types &quot;join <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at twistedmatrix.com</A>&quot; and
gets a window that says &quot;Arglebargle!&quot; because that is the python group's
preferred nickname? )

Thanks for the response.
