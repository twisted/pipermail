</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;select contact_info from contacts inner join rel on (rel.contactid =
</I>&gt;<i> contacts.contactid) where rel.accountid = whatever&quot;

</I>&gt;<i>        inner join
</I>&gt;<i>        contacts on (contacts.contactid=rel.contactid)
</I>&gt;<i>        where account.accountname = 'whatever'
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Either way, you should be getting back what you need in one
</I>&gt;<i> query. Does that make sense?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Certainly.., and it's not that far off from what I was doing.. except it
does seem a bit off in that no info is actually being pulled from the
account table - and if it were, it would be pulled multiple times (if i
want to pull the account name and account id, and then a list of
contacts).

the big important question here is ('scuse my german)... *drumroll*

how the fuck do I do this with twisted.enterprise.row? ;)

Unfortunately, the documentation for row seems pretty sketchy and shows
a direct parent-child relationship (room-&gt;furniture)..

it seems very unimportant what the underlying SQL does if row is
supposed to abstract it anyway..

any idears?

Thanks again!
