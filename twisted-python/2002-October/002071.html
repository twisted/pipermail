I can't easily get at the CVS version, but I suspect something like
that would have been useful. I've just had a brief look at the book
Moshe has mentioned on the list, and that looks helpful, too.

It's one of those chicken and egg situations - once the arrangement
&quot;clicks&quot;, it's hard to see why it seemed so complicated.

&gt;<i> Of course, then there's all the variations -- &quot;I want to implement a
</I>&gt;<i> {mail,web,finger,etc} server&quot; -- which is an awful lot of documentation.
</I>
Yes. I nearly didn't mention specific server types, because that's
what causes the explosion of cases. And just saying &quot;I want to write a
server&quot;, and not finding it obvious that you look at the &quot;Writing
Servers&quot; document is just plain dumb (I'm working on a decent excuse
for being this stupid :-))

&gt;<i> If you'd like to help us by writing a the &quot;I want to implement a news
</I>&gt;<i> server&quot; doc, that would help alot :)
</I>
I'll do what I can. But I'm now not sure of the benefit. There isn't
so much a learning curve with Twisted as a speed bump - at first
glance, you're not sure what you're looking at, but suddenly you
wonder what the difficulty was, and then you're off!

I'll think about whether I'd have found a conspicuous &quot;Start Here&quot;
document any use, and if so, I'll have a go at writing it :-)

Paul.
