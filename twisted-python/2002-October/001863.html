Agreed.  You need a whitelist to do this 100%, not a blacklist.  New
browser versions invent new ways of injecting js into HTML, so a
blacklist can never hope to be complete.  BugTraq has seen this every
time a major new browser version is released.  Also be aware of nasty
tricks like &quot;onmouse&amp;x6f;ver&quot; or however it is you can encode random
ascii (or unicode!) entities -- most browsers will still understand
that.  Your filter needs to as well.

I think there may be a fundamental flaw to filtering this with Woven.
Woven assumes correctly formed XML.  Browsers will still execute js on a
page that is HTML (or even HTML-ish!), even if it isn't XML.  That
already means there's probably tricks that lie outside the set of what
Woven can deal with -- though perhaps Woven can't generate them in the
first place?

If you intend to build XSS protection into Woven, I strongly recommend
you look through BugTraq's archives to get some idea of the wide variety
of techinques that can be involved -- in fact, I think they've started a
seperate mailing list for XSS now.
