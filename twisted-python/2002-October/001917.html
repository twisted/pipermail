<PRE>&gt;<i> FWIW I don't think it's possible to do run any post-installation 
</I>&gt;<i> code on win32 with distutils.  I haven't looked in depth for a while, 
</I>&gt;<i> but I  haven't heard news of this being fixed, either.

Weird!  I didn't believe this so I subclasses and plugged in
a new install command which wrote some trace stuff to disk.
You're right; it executes at the time of bdist_wininst, not
when installing.  

I also downloaded and looked through py2exe, which he has 
continued to extend separately.  He says it can now install
Windows services, which is VERY relevant to you and us;
and this implies he at least knows how to do post-install
stuff.  BTW I think you're going to need a generic way to make 
any tap file into a service (which is really just a way
of starting it when the system starts).  So, I am
sure it's fixable, but will need upgrades/patches to
distutils.

I've emailed Thomas to ask where this stands and if we
can help..
