	&quot;Talk to subprocess that runs this command to connect to the other end&quot;

	And yes, I may want that even after Twisted has a fully working

	I think you may want to look at SASL for ideas on
	authentication. It seems to be the standard way to add generic
	authentication support to a protocol these days.

	What part talks about TCP/UNIX/etc? service? Then it needs
	more structure to it.

	Eww. Passwords in URLs is baaad. Because users like to enter
	URLs on command line.

	I'd much rather see an explicit &quot;--password-file filename&quot; and
	&quot;--password-fd n&quot;.

&gt;<i> Public-key authentication mechanism, using the same identity name.  Connection

	Hmm. Idea. Allow one to specify when the server is trusted.
	&quot;Connect to server X if its public key has fingerprint F.&quot;

&gt;<i> 2. Automatic XSS input scrubbing for Woven
</I>&gt;<i> ==========================================
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Form input that is intended to be used as HTML can be scanned for potentially
</I>&gt;<i> abusive input so that the web administration interface for a bulletin board
</I>&gt;<i> written using Twisted doesn't fall prey to the usual &quot;cross site scripting&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> vulnerabilities that plague feedback-capable web sites.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem formulation, generally, is that an attacker will place some
</I>&gt;<i> malicious javascript in a web form.  When some article is viewed by an admin,
</I>&gt;<i> that malicious javascript executes in their browser, taking advantage of the
</I>&gt;<i> fact that they have an admin cookie for that website in their browser.  It will
</I>&gt;<i> take advantage of a security flaw in the browser and perform administrative
</I>&gt;<i> tasks with their authority on the website without the admin's approval.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are pretty much only a few ways they can do this, and I believe each one
</I>&gt;<i> has a simple solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     - &lt;script /&gt; tags
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't allow script tags in input, ever.  Force input that uses tags into a DOM
</I>&gt;<i> tree before it is even made to be preview-able.  (DOM parsing can be relaxed,
</I>&gt;<i> but before the tree is output, it is converted to well-formed XML).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     - &lt;a href=&quot;...&quot; /&gt; tags
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Stick a little warning after any &quot;off-site&quot; link, and turn it into a redirect.
</I>&gt;<i> Any admin clicking on such a link will first be bounced through a URL which
</I>&gt;<i> revokes their admin cookie so the attacking site won't have the ability to call
</I>&gt;<i> back.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     - attributes on other HTML tags, such as onmouseover, that execute js
</I>&gt;<i>       expressions
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Catalogue these and scrub them all off.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     - &lt;img /&gt; or &lt;object /&gt; tags that automatically download other items, which
</I>&gt;<i>       may be webpages containing javascript.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, don't allow these tags.  Or, have the server-side site download the
</I>&gt;<i> images and verify that they are PNGs (alternately also doing PIL stuff to
</I>&gt;<i> remove steganographic information, if you're _really_ paranoid).
</I>
	Your basic problem here is that you are trying to disallow
	things you know are not safe. That assumes you are omnipotent.
	While not contesting that, I still feel the only sane
	architecture is to catalogue known safe things, and only allow
	those. Something like a DTD/schema should do the job.

&gt;<i> Even if I managed to get this right for the web, though, trying to avoid lock
</I>&gt;<i> in to the web's way of thinking about forms is very tricky!  I have yet to
</I>&gt;<i> seriously think about how GTK, PyUI, or Tkinter would work with this.  I have
</I>&gt;<i> spent a little while thinking about how a text-based virtual world interface in
</I>&gt;<i> twisted reality, though, and that should be pretty easy (building a machine
</I>&gt;<i> with dials, knobs, etc, and a big button for &quot;submit&quot;).
</I>
	You may also be interested in the W3C work on XForms.

	IMHO, form-based GUIs suck horribly. A GUI is good only if
	it is interactive -- dynamic in some way. Most of the current
	GUIs only try to reach rich with forms that change
	dynamically.

	Have you ever used mc-foo fan? While certainly not the greatest
	GUI in the world, imagine you had to use it through forms.

&gt;<i> squatting.  I think that by having a distributed naming system (where different
</I>&gt;<i> people call the &quot;python&quot; group different things, but <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at twistedmatrix.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> will always get you to the one you're looking for) might circumvent squatting.
</I>
	So user A will see <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at python.org</A> as &quot;python&quot;, user B will see
	<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at twistedmatrix.com</A> as &quot;python&quot;, and if those two ever have
	to be squashed to the same namespace, user A will see
	&quot;python (<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at python.org</A>)&quot; and &quot;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at twistedmatrix.com</A>&quot;
	and user B will see &quot;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at python.org</A>&quot; and &quot;python
	(<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">python at twistedmatrix.com</A>)&quot;?

	All is fine as long as the users don't talk about the channel
	names that much :)

	This problem may be easier to think of in terms of nicks than of
	channels; IIRC there was some chat system that under the hood
	identified users with <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">user at host</A> (unix user id / email, whatever),
	but allowed them to set their list of &quot;preferred nicknames&quot;.
	User A would see user B with the first available preferred
	nickname from B's list, or as <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">userB at hostB</A> if none was
	available. And this was, IIRC, done fully in A's client; if B
	and C saw different people (were on different channels), they
	could see A with a different nickname.
