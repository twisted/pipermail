why wouldn't i allow the uid/gid that the server is running at, to read the tap?
after all the the tap is nothing but a snapshot of the running application?

if twistd did setuid() etc. calls before loading the tap, this would yield
a definite improvement in security. e.g. chroot already is defined by twistd,
presumably because it too requires root privileges to be used.

</I>
the persisted tap shouldn't allow me to do anything i couldn't do with a
hijacked application running at some uid. i don't see why i shouldn't be able
to load a tap and run it with less privileges.

as i see it, tap r/w access shouldn't be any different from application code access 
in terms of severity.
