As of now, I'm leaning towards using twisted.enterprise without
t.e.row...except purely for learning purposes. Just this simple
example of yours shows how quickly object &lt;-&gt; relational model
mappings can get tricky. But learning about it should be interesting
nevertheless.

Yeah...I read it. That was my thought as well...use a view to flatten
out two of the objects into one. I'm trying to think of tweaking that
might help simplify the situation there. Some databases have
functionality that might enable you to use one denormalized view and
rewrites on the db backend that would peform the updates properly
depending on the table. But that functionality would be in the
database, so it would be implementation-specific.
