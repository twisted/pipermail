Generally, one would rarely want to have sockets that don't timeout.  To
have sockets without timeout opens a server up to easy DoS attacks.  I
can't imagine a time when you wouldn't want to time out sockets, even if
you're trying to tunnel something over HTTP.  If you pull out an ethernet
cable or a modem phone line, connections don't get closed either.  Any
assumption that connections will always close nicely is flawed.  Though,
maybe I'm misunderstanding what you mean by 'no timeout'

Personally, when I was running high volume web servers, we'd tune down the
keepalive timers to a fairly short interval to keep sockets from getting
tied up too long, to prevent resource availability issues that we were
seeing.
