Well, maybe I'm stupid or so. Someone then minds to explain the pagers ? There 
is basically no documentation about them and from the code they are far from 
easy to understand. What gets executed where exactly ?

To put it that way. The only way to have a decent amount of security is to 
turn your computer off and lock it into a safe. And even then there might be 
bad guys.

</I>
So where do you put your paycheck ? Into a &quot;trusted&quot; bank account ??
What are the useful features of a firewall besides making is hard to create 
connections ? If I run a webserver inside a firewalled LAN and block all 
ports on the firewall, how is a hacker supposed to take advantage of port 80, 
except if he hacks the firewall (which might be hard in this case since, 
remember: all ports blocked, no incoming transmission allowed)
I'd say firewalls increase the level of security, they don't provide 100% 
security. I'm btw not talking about packet-filters, often sold as firewall.
