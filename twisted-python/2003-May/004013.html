That wouldn't make too much sense, would it ?
I'm running the server inside the LAN on a RFC address. So the server is 
accessible from the LAN, however since the firewall blocks all incoming 
traffic it won't be accessible from the outside (assuming you have a firewall 
and use IP-NAT )

No it's not redundant. Just take a LAN and unplug the link to the internet. 
This is basically the setup (except that you also won't have outgoing stuff)

Correct, that's excatly what I'm talking about.

then complain about &quot;security&quot; as they perceive it and buy stuff like 
&quot;wingate&quot;.
 
BTW: if you're ever looking for a good firewall in germany, take a look at 
www.genua.de. Magnus Harlander (founder and owner) is a real capacity when it 
comes to security. I was working with him for a couple of years before I 
immigrated to the US.
