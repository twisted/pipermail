The explanation is that the *other side* doesn't trust you -- maybe you're
trying to DoS it? This is a good design decision: you want multiple processes
to not trust each other. As an aside, whenever you hear the word &quot;trust&quot;
you should think &quot;lack of security&quot; -- by extension, &quot;distrust&quot; is &quot;more
secure&quot;.

&gt;<i> Assume I have a remotecall using pb. According to the size limitation the

</I>
Yep. the cBanana on the other side decided that you looked like an evil
DoSer, and terminated you.

&gt;<i> Is this really a good thing to do ? Shouldn't pb see that the arguments are 
</I>&gt;<i> larger than 640k and start paging ?
</I>
That's *way* to DWIMy, IMHO.

&gt;<i> What I'm doing is to hand down XML data which is database-generated on the 
</I>&gt;<i> server side. Whenever a user requests a too large resultset the network layer 
</I>&gt;<i> fails. On the other hand the resultset already is in memory, so why not jut 
</I>&gt;<i> transfer it ?
</I>
Use StringPager. It's in memory. *Always* use StringPager, even if you're
below the security limit. 8k (by default) things will get transferred
in one go, larger strings will be sent in 8k chunks, allowing the other
side to digest them slowly without building big *intermediary* structures
in memory.

&gt;<i> So what makes is &quot;more secure&quot; to limit the size ??
</I>
That if your db-using process gets 0wned (if you pardon my trust),
it won't be able to drag down the other process.

Riley: Yeah, a lot of young people nowadays are experimenting with shortness.
