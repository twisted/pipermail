Your understanding is correct.

There's nothing special going on.  As far as a DeferredList is concerned,
all Deferreds are the same.  Where the Deferred comes from is irrelevant.

I suspect you're right, you probably are misunderstanding something.  It's
hard to say what, though, without more information.  (But when something is
mysteriously freezing, it's hard to know what information to give!)

A DeferredList, by default, calls its callbacks *only when all of its
Deferreds have fired*.  (If some of the Deferreds fail, that's ok, just so
long as they all call their callback/errback at some point).  A DeferredList
has no way of reporting partial results.

I'm going to guess what your problem might be, based on a problem I once
had.  :)

If you have multiple Deferreds, some &quot;depend&quot; on others, DeferredList's
default behaviour isn't what you want.  By &quot;depend&quot; I mean if Deferred A
fails (and so fires its errback, not callback), then Deferred B will never
be called, i.e. B depends on A.  (This is not official terminology! :).

In that case, you probably want to use the fireOnOneErrback flag of
DeferredList.  This changes the behaviour of DeferredList so that it will
fire its callbacks as soon as either:
    - All its Deferreds have fired their callbacks, or
    - any of its Deferreds have fired an errback.

Does any of this help you?

-Andrew.
