agreed

&gt;<i> &gt; Assume I have a remotecall using pb. According to the size limitation the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parameters given to a specific function can not exceed 640kb. What if I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hand over an object that exceeds the 640k ? Ok, the obvious happens and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cBanana throws an error &quot;security precaution .....&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yep. the cBanana on the other side decided that you looked like an evil
</I>&gt;<i> DoSer, and terminated you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is this really a good thing to do ? Shouldn't pb see that the arguments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are larger than 640k and start paging ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's *way* to DWIMy, IMHO.
</I>
but it would be more convenient and transparent for the programmer not to have 
take care of paging :-)

&gt;<i> &gt; What I'm doing is to hand down XML data which is database-generated on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the server side. Whenever a user requests a too large resultset the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; network layer fails. On the other hand the resultset already is in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; memory, so why not jut transfer it ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Use StringPager. It's in memory. *Always* use StringPager, even if you're
</I>&gt;<i> below the security limit. 8k (by default) things will get transferred
</I>&gt;<i> in one go, larger strings will be sent in 8k chunks, allowing the other
</I>&gt;<i> side to digest them slowly without building big *intermediary* structures
</I>&gt;<i> in memory.
</I>
The busines logic behind it simply gets way to complicated if I have to 
separate calls into &quot;small&quot; and &quot;large&quot; ones. It's complicated already ( 
approaching 100k lines of code) and if I have to split the stuff and put some 
logic in there that catches the large calls and pages them it will add 
another 5k lines of code.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So what makes is &quot;more secure&quot; to limit the size ??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That if your db-using process gets 0wned (if you pardon my trust),
</I>&gt;<i> it won't be able to drag down the other process.
</I>
Well, unlikely but not a bad asumption. Better have it safe.
Since my application will run inside a trusted environment only (behind 
firewalls in an intranet) I think I'll just remove the size limit. Any 
connection from the outside will have to use VPN anyways, since I'm a 
distrusting person and won't let anyone into &quot;my&quot; network.
