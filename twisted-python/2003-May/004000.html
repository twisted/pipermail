And surprising in corner cases, and very difficult to debug.  This is 
basically the same case for using large numbers of threads rather than 
an event-driven API.  This is not how Twisted works.

In fact, we have taken great care to describe PB as a &quot;translucent&quot; 
remote access API, never &quot;transparent&quot;.  Transparency is explicitly not 
a goal.

Your response implies you have inverted Moshe's meaning.  I think what 
Moshe was saying, in your terminology, is: 'Do not separate calls into 
&quot;small&quot; and &quot;large&quot; ones.  Treat all calls as &quot;large&quot;.  In the lowere 
levels of Twisted, this will do a reasonably efficient thing even if 
the data is actually small, and it will not complicate your code.'

&gt;<i> if I have to split the stuff and put some logic in there that catches 
</I>&gt;<i> the large calls and pages them it will add another 5k lines of code.
</I>
Given the expansion that we have repeatedly given using 
twisted.spread.util (this may turn 1 line into 3 lines, although in 
most cases it just makes a slightly longer line) this implies that you 
have at least 1600 separate lines where you are doing a callRemote that 
is directly retrieving a potentially large XML payload.  It seems like 
this is something which you could get quite a bit of benefit out of 
abstracting into a thinner interface.
