Not magic as in not understandable, thus the quotes. It's obivous how
it works, it just doesn't feel as clean as using a failure, especially
when passing a non-standard response (the possiblity of which was
completely lost in your initial implementation). While using a failure
certainly is more expensive, the expected result is for the address to
be acceptable, so it shouldn't happen too often. So I still feel that
using failures is a cleaner approach, and if it proves too costly,
perhaps the first thing to do should be to see if the failures can be
made lighter, possibly optionally lighter for &quot;expected&quot; failures.
