This is very unhelpful, Moshe.  The documentation on the Twisted website
(as mentioned in my earlier note), unlike most Python standard
documentation, does not indicate in which versions the examples work
(PicturePile, specifically).  Nothing like &quot;new in 1.0.4&quot;.  Moreover,
the errors did not make it obvious there was a version issue (and in any
case, the example still needed some minor corrections to work with
1.0.5).  Andrew's advice (and some by email) was helpful, but it was
hardly obvious a priori what the issue was.

Moreover, I have not encountered any change log that addresses woven 
version differences in any detail.  Quite possibly there is such a 
document, but I do not now know where it is.

None of this, btw., means to demean Twisted itself.  I do think it could 
use a bit more directed documentation, but the concept and subpackages 
themselves seem very useful and well conceived.

Yours, David...
