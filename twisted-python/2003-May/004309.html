Who's &quot;we&quot;, kimosabe - mind control is certainly on my agenda.

The modules that you mentioned have mostly accurate stability info, 
with the exception of banana - we tried to stabilize that one before we 
had enough users, performance testing, and security auditing, so there 
are some tweaks that will be happening in an upcoming rewrite.  
twisted.internet.interfaces looks like it's a little inconsistent, 
though -  Itamar, would you look into updating that?

If it says &quot;stable&quot;, then we are committed to changing things very 
little, and providing extensive (and probably indefinite) maintenance 
of the existing interface even if things do change.

If it says &quot;semi-stable&quot;, you can probably only join IRC when releases 
happen and ask anyone if the changes are likely to impact you.  (You 
could attempt to infer this from CVS logs and the ChangeLog file, but 
considering the quantity and subtlety of changes that happen each 
release, it's probably for all concerned just to ask.)  These 
interfaces will change seldom and typically be well-announced if 
anything major happens.

If it specifically says &quot;unstable&quot;, you should be tracking CVS and on a 
first-name basis with at least one Twisted developer, preferably the 
maintainer of the module of your choice :).
