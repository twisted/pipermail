Cool :-)

The woven-specific attributes should really all be removed -- any that 
are left in are just there because I have been lazy about it, since as 
you observe modern browsers don't care. I'll try to go through and make 
sure woven outputs clean XHTML by the next release... I have been 
meaning to do it for a while anyway.

The tendency for woven to overwrite ids you try to set has been fixed 
in CVS. Also, since several people have requested it, I will remove the 
auto-id setting unless you are using LivePage, which is the only thing 
that uses it.

&gt;<i> Is this just the way Woven works, or am I likely doing something wrong?

I would consider these bugs, and thanks for the report!
