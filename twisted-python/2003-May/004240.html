<PRE>Itamar Shtull-Trauring:
&gt;<i> This is... inaccurate. Jelly has security policies. The one used in the
</I>&gt;<i> jelly module's jelly() and unjelly() module-level functions is setup by
</I>&gt;<i> default for allowing anything, so as to make using it easy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, the security policy for jelly in the network protocol PB only
</I>&gt;<i> allows deserializing classes which have been explicitly approved by the
</I>&gt;<i> user.
</I>
Mmmm, I see the security code, and it looks safe enough against my
attack.  (I saw the code originally, but I went the wrong way down
an if-statement.  I saw a __class__ being created, but hadn't realized
what it meant to be unjellyable.)

Here's another attack: what happens if I pass back a string which
encodes [[[[[[[[[[ ... ]]]]]]]]]] where there are enough []s to
break the recursion limit?

 &gt;&gt;&gt; banana.encode(jelly.jelly([]))
'\x01\x80\x04\x82list'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; banana.encode(jelly.jelly([[]]))
'\x02\x80\x04\x82list\x01\x80\x04\x82list'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; banana.encode(jelly.jelly([[[]]]))
'\x02\x80\x04\x82list\x02\x80\x04\x82list\x01\x80\x04\x82list'
 &gt;&gt;&gt;

The safe unjelly code uses a recursive call, so there can be at
most 1,000 levels.  Each level takes 8 characters, so I can
break the recursion limit at 8,000 bytes, and generate a
RuntimeError.  It looks like this exception is caught in
an 'except:' in _recvMessage, so that's okay (except for a
few OSes with a small stack size) ... except what happens
if the connection then closes and answerRequired is set and
so _sendError is called, which calls Banana's sendEncoded
which does a transport.write which fails .... ahh, that's
too deep into the way Twisted works for me to follow any
further, but it looks like write is guaranteed to catch all
underlying errors.

So my first pass suggests the code can be used in a resonable
secure way.

BTW, in my review I saw that jelly.py uses this code:

     for i in dir(module):
         i_ = getattr(module, i)
         if type(i_) == types.ClassType:
             if issubclass(i_, baseClass):
                 setUnjellyableForClass('%s%s' % (prefix, i), i_)

Is there any reason this code doesn't use &quot;for i, i_ in 
module.__dict__.items()&quot;?
I point it out because formally speaking the definition of &quot;dir()&quot; is
documented as &quot;primarily as a convenience for use at an interactive 
prompt&quot;
and &quot;its detailed behavior may change across releases.&quot;  OTOH, it ain't
broke, so no need to fix it.

For completeness,

% fgrep 'dir(' */*.py | grep -v '[a-z]dir'
im/gtkcommon.py:        for n in dir(base):
     # the behaviour of dir has changed since this was created.
     # I think in newer Pythons it isn't needed.  But it doesn't
     # break and is needed for older ones.

manhole/explorer.py:        for i in dir(instance):
     # The method is documented as
     #       Note these are only the *instance* methods and members --
     #       if you want the class methods, you'll have to look up the 
class.
     #
     # However, with the change of dir behaviour in newer Pythons, this
     # is no longer true -- all names are returned.  Fix doc or fix code?


manhole/explorer.py:        for i in dir(theClass):
     # not sure which behaviour is desired

names/authority.py:        for record in [x for x in dir(dns) if 
x.startswith('Record_')]:
     # should be
     #   for record in [v for k,v in dns.__dict__.items() if 
k.startswith('Record_')]:
     # and get rid of the next line

spread/jelly.py:    for i in dir(module):
spread/newjelly.py:    for i in dir(module):
    # mentioned above
trial/unittest.py:        names = dir(module)
% fgrep 'dir(' */*/*.py | grep -v '[a-z]dir'
conch/ssh/connection.py:for v in dir(connection):
conch/ssh/transport.py:for v in dir(transport):
     # connection.__dict__.names() also works

conch/ssh/userauth.py:for v in dir(userauth):
     # userauth.__dict__ also works

spread/ui/gtk2util.py:        for k in dir(self):
     # not sure, but here's the context
     #
     #    # mold can go away when we get a newer pygtk (post 1.99.14)
     #    mold = {}
     #    for k in dir(self):
     #        mold[k] = getattr(self, k)
     #
     #  Should it go away?
