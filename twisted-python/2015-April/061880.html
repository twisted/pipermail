</I> The deferToThread just shoves the write of the message string to file into
the thread pool. It was added after this issue was observed. Using
deferToThread
is a hangover from attaching a logging callback when the file wrote, since
removed, so callInThread would work also. I didn't want to add the file
write onto the reactor thread here.

I wish I could find a simpler case, but frankly, I have an integration test
system that uses a test app to generate upstream messages, and an open
source java app to simulate the downstream server. I can't reproduce this
there even with all the moving parts.

Happening &quot;in the wild&quot; at one location, was hoping for some advice on
troubleshooting what happens between calling transport.write and seeing
bytes on the wire. I guess it's time to go digging into parts of twisted
I've always taken for granted, and learn something new. ;-)
