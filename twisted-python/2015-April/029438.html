Jonathan Jacobs is responsible for the neat UI.

Since the underlying structure is a sequence of independent messages you
can e.g. feed Eliot messages into ElasticSearch and then use Kibana,
which is quite helpful. This does involve a little bit of &quot;manual&quot;
tracing of the tree structure (sorting by the relevant column,
basically.) I haven't spent much time using Eliot in anger due to last
year's pivot at work so haven't thought that much about building UIs
yet. 

&gt;<i> Will any of the additional structuring or filtering of log messages from the new logging system be helpful to Elliot? If so, do you have any pointers for Eeshan where he might improve existing messages?
</I>
At work we have a thing that routes Twisted logs into Eliot; being able
to route structured messages will correspondingly improve the quality of
the resulting logs. Insofar as Eliot's tree structure is callstack based
(with additional support for Deferreds) most Twisted (or stdlib, or
whatever) log messages will typically end up in the correct place in the
action tree if you route them to Eliot.
