<PRE>Hi,

I've been using Twisted for a while now and for the most part I've been
quite pleased with it.  Perhaps the one exception to this is when it comes
to Windows, but that's only because of pywin32.  For those unaware, there's
essentially two options right now.  Install pywin32 manually or add
the pypywin32 package to your project as a requirement.  So long as the
wheel package is installed...it's pretty easy to work around pywin32's
installer issues.

But, I wouldn't mind if the pywin32/wheel+pypiwin32 requirements went away
on Windows.  Pywin32 can be difficult to get working sometimes and it's
unfortunate that the Windows install can sometimes require a couple of
manual steps when working with Twisted.  So far as I can tell, Twisted
itself does not use a great deal of the pywin32 library and there's even a
ticket open that seems to indicate it's on the list of things to eventually
do and it's been mentioned at least a few times outside of this ticket:

    <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7477">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/7477</A>

So my question is, does anyone know if any work has been done along the
lines of removing the pywin32 dependency and converting to cffi?  Outside
of the link above, I'm not seeing much so far and based on some rudimentary
testing
&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/opalmer/twisted/blob/02c0c56382f25b239fe177807541528cc940dadf/scratch.py">https://github.com/opalmer/twisted/blob/02c0c56382f25b239fe177807541528cc940dadf/scratch.py</A>&gt;
it
seems like it's worth picking up since I've had to work around
&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/pyfarm/pyfarm-agent/pull/250/files">https://github.com/pyfarm/pyfarm-agent/pull/250/files</A>&gt; this problem
before.

Would anyone object to me doing some work on this?  I can't promise
anything yet since I'm still investigating it but I figured it would be a
good time to reach out for some input before moving forward.

Thanks,
Oliver Palmer
