Yeah, this is the big issue.  Hence: pex ;-).  Or, 'pile of wheels' and 'venv on the fly (without dev tools)' as the installation mechanism on the target environment.

&gt;<i> But honestly I think we're talking at cross purposes. I'm not complaining about virtualenv. We use them quite successfully.
</I>
I think this has been a super useful discussion, not at cross purposes at all!  There's been a little bit of back-and-forth and repeating certain things, but not useless.

&gt;<i> I'm trying to point out that *some* might find the system Python attractive because they can use OS-supplied python packages in lieu of the effort of setting up a binary build infrastructure.
</I>
So, I think everyone has a different perspective here; Hynek seems to be saying &quot;all containers all the time&quot; ;-).  But from my perspective, linux distros provide a super useful service by providing a gigantic integrated build environment for TONS of C code.  Avoiding the time and cost associated with setting up, i.e., an ImageMagick dev environment is _WELL_ worth the complexity of distro packages.  Multiply this out by dozens of dependencies that a large application or site ends up needing, and distro packaging pays for itself many times over.

However, avoiding having python-dev and a C compiler installed in your build environment seems like a bit of a fool's errand to me.  It's superficially appealing, but I think that our guidance to most people should be &quot;always have a build environment so you can build extension modules, any non-trivial project will eventually need a few&quot;.  The work required to have a _python_ dev environment is orders of magnitude below, say, OpenSSL or ImageMagick or Avahi or (et cetera).

&gt;<i> But I'm clearly not getting my point across, so I'm going to stop now.
</I>
Really I think that this has been a great exchange of ideas, and though we're veering off topic a little bit, I want there to be more discussion among systems operators how Twisted can and should be deployed, operationalized, monitored, etc.  Twisted even has weird little edge-cases of its own (like the plugin system) which can sometimes complicate things.  So by all means please don't feel like you need to stop sharing your view.
