Given an arbitrarily powerful CI system, you could do something.

Assume two projects, A and B, with a dependency between them (doesn't
matter which direction, I think; doesn't even have to be one-way though
obviously it should be).

When A changes, do a build of B.  Use the new A and the newest version of B
which had a successful build.  If this build succeeds, A and B are probably
still working well together.  If this build fails, there's a good chance A
just introduced a regression.

Apply the same logic with A and B reversed.

I expect you could implement this on BuildBot.  It might be more realistic
to do something slightly simpler - like pinning the version of B in the
A-changed builds (and vice versa).  This would miss regressions relating to
changes in B introduced after the pinned version - but maybe that's okay
(you could update pinned versions with each release of B or once every few
months or something).  I think you could implement this on something like
travis-ci without *much* difficulty.  Just duplicate (some of) the treq
(for example) travis-ci configuration in Twisted's travis-ci
configuration.  It doesn't sound crazy to say &quot;treq 16.12.0 test suite
should be required to pass for Twisted <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">trunk at HEAD</A> (at least until around
Twisted 17.12, probably?).

And of course there's bound to be noise out of this system, too.  I'd guess
it would be little enough that the result is still valuable but hard to say
for sure without trying...
