I guess this is a big part of the motivation for Twisted itself to shed its
C extensions - to avoid 100% of these extra dependencies.  And presumably
also a big part of the motivation behind the development of support for
distributable binary wheels for Linux (which seems to have largely
succeeded at this point, though their use is not as widespread as one would
hope).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>And I've been meaning to really dig in to the Nix toolchain for image
creation.  That seems like another thing that should be more widely used
(but it's hard to beat the &quot;batteries included&quot; tools Docker has, even if
those tools are awful).

</I>Ah!  They are now, maybe you haven't seen them?

Go is looking like a more and more attractive competitor to Python,
&gt;<i> frankly, having sidestepped this problem entirely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>A lot of people seem to be thinking that way.  *Personally*, with my
experience with Go (about five months solid at previous employer), I
wouldn't go anywhere near that stack.  There are plenty of *other *things
with appealing features that Python lacks which would seem to make a better
move. :)

But check out the story for binary wheels.  The state of things in Python
may not be *quite* as bad as you think.
