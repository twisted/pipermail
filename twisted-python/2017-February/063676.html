Have you considered the 'conda' package manager?

If not, and for the benefit of others (I'm amazed it's not
mentioned on this list) here is my conda rant:

TL;DR:  use conda.

IMO, conda is superior to pip/wheels.  The Python packaging
orthodoxy's story is &quot;oh, yes, conda -- that solves a different
problem ...&quot; which seems disingenuous to me.  Conda
was originally created by Continuum Analytics to solve the
Numpy/SciPy packaging problem(s), which it has done with
brilliant success.

Conda has its own kind of packages, but they are relatively
easy to create (I can do it, proving that anyone can ;)
both for your own packages and for PyPI packages -- see:
<A HREF="https://conda.io/docs/build_tutorials/pkgs.html">https://conda.io/docs/build_tutorials/pkgs.html</A>

Conda is a system-level package manager in the sense that it
can install any package, including Python itself, and
creates its own type of 'virtual environments' with their
own Python versions (which it will install).  Conda does
a great job of keeping non-Python libraries that Python
packages depend on isolated from system libraries.  If
the version of a Python package you want to use depends
on a later version of a library that exists on your
system, conda will install the required version of the
library in the virtual environment, keeping it separate
from other versions of that library on your system.

The latest version of Twisted is available from the main
conda package repository and is well supported.  I am
developing an application with many dependencies, including
Twisted, PyQt5, pythonOCC (a massive python-wrapped C++ 3D
CAD library), and many scientific libraries, and conda is
the only Python packaging and distribution technology that
can support my app -- I would not even begin to attempt it
using pip.

I've also used conda to manage large Django applications.
After I showed conda to my sysadmins at work, they jumped
on it and now use it for all Python installations on our
servers.  They will never have to compile Python again!

I do all my development on an Ubuntu 14.04 laptop and use
conda for everything Python on my machine.

Cheers,
Steve
