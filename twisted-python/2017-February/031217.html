<PRE>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So my problem is that while my protocol stack spins up very nicely and trivially easy using the twistd daemon, the standard python3-twisted package for 14.04 is waaaay behind and doesn't include twistd (!), and I haven't found a good backport.  I'd also like to avoid doing things that make life hard for DevOps, such as pip3 installing and risking a package manager fight.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The general solution to this problem is &quot;don't use the system Python environment to deploy your applications&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is what virtualenv is for.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Yes, well, the standard practice around here is to wrap up deliverables in a .deb so that the DevOps tools can do automated deploys.  I suppose it is possible to wrap up a venv in a .deb, but I&#8217;ve never done looked into it. Pointers welcome.

&gt;&gt;<i> So some options:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Is there a reliable backport of the python3-twisted package for 14.04?  Google is failing me on that one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Perhaps I should create my own backport for Ubuntu 14.04 of the current python3-twisted .deb.  (This is probably not the right list to ask, but I'm happy to dereference a pointer.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Both of these options are bad.  Installing or creating a backport will break any system tools that depend on the python3-twisted package.  This is better than `sudo pip3 install`, but only a little.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - All I need is the most basic twistd functionality.  Perhaps I should spin up my own by snarfing the code out of the twisted source repo.  I can package this with my stuff temporarily and get on with life.  Clues to the relevant parts of the repo welcome, I haven't poked around much in Twisted sources so need a road map.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you have the ability to ship parts of the Twisted stack, there's a tool that can automate the &quot;snarfing&quot;: pip :-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is a short-term problem for me, we are transitioning to 16.04 soon, but the process is driven by other parts of the software stack. So I don't want to over-invest.  I'm looking for a reasonable band-aid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 16.04 will also be out of date.
</I>
So&#8230; If you would like to dive into reasons&#8230; we do robots.  We use ROS, the Robot Operating System.  LTS versions of ROS are tied to LTS versions of Ubuntu.  Transitioning from one LTS version of ROS to another is, as they say, &#8220;non-trivial&#8221;.  Being on a stale version of Ubuntu is part of the price for using ROS, because ROS just can&#8217;t move that fast.  No one likes it.  A lot of people (in many ROS-based companies, and the OSRF) are working to improve the situation.  That doesn&#8217;t help me this week.  Now, why are the DevOps people here so conservative?  Because doing a remote update on a robot in the field, and having it fail, has two impacts: 1) we stop billing the customer until the robot is running again, and 2) we put someone on an airplane to make the robot run again.  

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm tempted to launch into a diatribe about namespacing, containers, and application isolation generally, but before I do - why is it that you want to use the system Python environment?  Had you just not considered the option of virtual environments?
</I>
Legitimate questions.  Fitting into the existing deployment flow, and ummm&#8230; can I wrap a venv in a .deb? &#8216;Cuz that would be cool.

Another poster mentioned Anaconda&#8230;. I&#8217;m not a huge fan.  I am using it extensively as part of the Udacity self-driving car class, and I will admit that it would be nearly impossible for Udacity to deploy the project environment any other way.  But I see Anaconda as a very heavy-weight solution for projects requiring a huge infrastructure, and my problem is no where near large enough that the benefits justifies the cost.  A simple venv is more in line.
