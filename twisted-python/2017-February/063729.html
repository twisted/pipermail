</I>Changes to Twisted code which are only sometimes covered by the test suite
sound like they would violate a 100% coverage rule.  But I guess the
experience of looking at a codecov report is so bad/confusing that it's not
surprising authors/reviewers might fail to see what's going on and fix the
non-deterministic.

Particularly for code that requires coverage measurements on multiple
platforms (ie, you basically *can't* do it locally), it seems like it would
be easier (though, to be clear, *bad*) to just forget about it and hope
everything is covered...

A tool that pointed out coverage differences between multiple runs of the
same version of the code would be a useful thing to start pointing out
where these flaws in the Twisted test suite lie, right?  And then each area
could be given deterministic test coverage instead...
