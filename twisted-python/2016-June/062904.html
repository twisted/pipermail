</I>OK. Thanks!

I was not sure if the github bot technical decision was taken.

I was not sure if we made a decision for labels vs PR state.

I am -1 for closing a PR as a way of saying: changes are pretty good but a
few tests are missing :)

---------

I am +1 on using labels/keywords in GitHub but I am not sure what will be
the relation between the Trac tickets and the PRs?
Will there be links between them?
Will the Trac tickets be migrated to GitHub Issues?

---------

In case it helps, for my project I am doing it in another way.

I am not suggesting that Twisted should use the same process, but maybe it
can help to get an idea of how this can be done.

The code for the bot is here <A HREF="https://github.com/chevah/github-hooks-server">https://github.com/chevah/github-hooks-server</A>
... and it uses Trac via xml-rpc

The tickets are hosted in Trac, but I have implemented a Trac ticket
workflow. I can share the Trac configuration.

Instead of adding the 'review' keyword, a ticket is actually placed in a
'need_review' state... and instead of removing the 'review' keyword and
assigning the ticket back the ticket can either go into a
'changes_approved' state ... or in a 'need_more_work' state.

Each PR has an associated ticket in Trac.

I have 'needs-review', 'changes-approved' and 'needs-changes' keyword for
managing the ticket state via GitHub PR comments.
The bot also update the &quot;branch&quot; Trac field with a link to the latest PR
associated with a Trac ticket

You can see an example here for the GitHub side
<A HREF="https://github.com/chevah/python-package/pull/54">https://github.com/chevah/python-package/pull/54</A> ... the Trac side is
private but I can share a screenshot if required.

The bot is briefly described here
