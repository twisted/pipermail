</I>&gt;<i> Recently we have introduced a hard check of 100% coverage for all changes.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now, if your patch is not 100% covered github will not let you merge it.

</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't always make sense to require 100% execution of all test code.  It's not at all uncommon to only have code in a test suite that runs when a test fails.  Historically, Twisted has never had a requirement of 100% execution of test code.  The only test suite coverage requirements that have commonly been requested or enforced is for coverage of implementation code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd suggest removing the coverage enforcement for test suite code.
</I>
I am inclined to disagree, albeit mildly.

When one is writing a deliberately un-covered path in test code, presumably, one is writing either a test helper - a mock, fake, or utility for setting up a real implementation - or an assertion method.  Historically, I believe that when we've invested more heavily in making these utilities &quot;real&quot; themselves, and not just throwaway stuff inline in a test method or module, the benefits have far outweighed the costs.  In fact the availability of proto_helpers is one of the selling points of Twisted as opposed to other competing engines.

Therefore, I think that asking folks to add independent test coverage to verify their fakes and ensure that the failure-reporting of their assertion messages are helpful in the event a test fails is a generally good idea, and we should keep the requirement for 100% coverage on both test and implementation coverage.

However, if there is contention around this, I'd much rather get a ratchet in place for implementation code that's reliable and everyone is happy with, so I'm OK with disabling coverage reporting for our *.test.* packages as a step towards that.

&gt;<i> How should we proceed with these changes?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe this is not the best example and that code could be refactored... but I think that the topic of ignoring missing coverage is still valid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest to introduce `  # pragma: no cover`
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and update the coverage config with
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [report]
</I>&gt;<i> exclude_lines =
</I>&gt;<i>     pragma: no cover
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This seems like the wrong solution to me.  It forces contributors to do extra work to mark their test code as an exception and provides a mechanism for incorrectly bypassing the check by using a no-cover pragma in implementation code.
</I>
In any case I totally agree with this.  If we have a categorical difference in types of code (test vs. non-test) then let's make that distinction, but we should not be adding one-off exceptions as an exercise of non-uniform reviewer judgement on every review.
