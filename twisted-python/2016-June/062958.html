</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Recently we have introduced a hard check of 100% coverage for all changes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is done via coverage + codecov + github protected branches.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, if your patch is not 100% covered github will not let you merge it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> See for example this change:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The errback is there to help with test failures ... but the test should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> never fail, so that errback is never called... and that line is not covered.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't always make sense to require 100% execution of all test code.
</I>&gt;<i> It's not at all uncommon to only have code in a test suite that runs when a
</I>&gt;<i> test fails.  Historically, Twisted has never had a requirement of 100%
</I>&gt;<i> execution of test code.  The only test suite coverage requirements that
</I>&gt;<i> have commonly been requested or enforced is for coverage of implementation
</I>&gt;<i> code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd suggest removing the coverage enforcement for test suite code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am inclined to disagree, albeit mildly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When one is writing a deliberately un-covered path in test code,
</I>&gt;<i> presumably, one is writing either a test helper - a mock, fake, or utility
</I>&gt;<i> for setting up a real implementation - or an assertion method.
</I>&gt;<i> Historically, I believe that when we've invested more heavily in making
</I>&gt;<i> these utilities &quot;real&quot; themselves, and not just throwaway stuff inline in a
</I>&gt;<i> test method or module, the benefits have far outweighed the costs.  In fact
</I>&gt;<i> the availability of proto_helpers is one of the selling points of Twisted
</I>&gt;<i> as opposed to other competing engines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I mostly agree with this.  However, I was thinking of a slightly different
pattern when I wrote my earlier email.  Here's are a couple (fictional)
examples of that pattern one might find in unit tests for application code
(and there's nothing Twisted-specific here):

if foo:
    self.fail(&quot;Foo!&quot;)

try:
    foo()
except:
    bar
else:
    self.fail(&quot;Foo :(&quot;)

It's not exactly that this *can't* be code that's executed in a passing run
of the test suite.  It's more a question of what the right balance point
is.  If someone wants to generalize logic like this (and, fortunately,
someone did generalize these *particular* examples - they're assertFalse
and assertRaises, respectively) then that's great and the result is a
higher level of confidence resulting from a successful run of the test
suite.  I'd suggest that if tests like these exercise all of the
implementation code (on a successful run), though, then you've still
achieved a pretty high level of test coverage and maybe further efforts are
more productively directed elsewhere (increasing the coverage level of
other implementation code in Twisted, for example :).

If folks want a higher bar than this, I'm not going to argue (at least not
much, at least not now).  The bar *hasn't* been this high in the past
though (and there are many many such cases to be found in Twisted's test
suite right now and I don't have the impression this has ever been *much*
of a source of problems).


&gt;<i> Therefore, I think that asking folks to add independent test coverage to
</I>&gt;<i> verify their fakes and ensure that the failure-reporting of their assertion
</I>&gt;<i> messages are helpful in the event a test fails is a generally good idea,
</I>&gt;<i> and we should keep the requirement for 100% coverage on both test and
</I>&gt;<i> implementation coverage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, if there is contention around this, I'd much rather get a ratchet
</I>&gt;<i> in place for implementation code that's reliable and everyone is happy
</I>&gt;<i> with, so I'm OK with disabling coverage reporting for our *.test.* packages
</I>&gt;<i> as a step towards that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I completely agree that fakes should be verified.  So much so that I'm not
even sure I believe in fakes in *general* anymore.  Instead, you should
just have easy to use interfaces and ship inexpensive implementations
alongside whatever other implementations you also need.  And all those
implementations should have great test coverage.  I also completely agree
that when tests fail, they should do so in a meaningful way.  I suspect
slightly the implication that automated test coverage for the failure case
demonstrates the failure is reported meaningfully, though. :)  I think
we're still stuck with relying on humans (authors, reviewers) to verify
that property.

&gt;<i> How should we proceed with these changes?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe this is not the best example and that code could be refactored...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I think that the topic of ignoring missing coverage is still valid.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I suggest to introduce `  # pragma: no cover`
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and update the coverage config with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [report]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exclude_lines =
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     pragma: no cover
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems like the wrong solution to me.  It forces contributors to do
</I>&gt;<i> extra work to mark their test code as an exception *and* provides a
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism for incorrectly bypassing the check by using a no-cover pragma in
</I>&gt;<i> implementation code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case I totally agree with *this*.  If we have a categorical
</I>&gt;<i> difference in types of code (test vs. non-test) then let's make that
</I>&gt;<i> distinction, but we should not be adding one-off exceptions as an exercise
</I>&gt;<i> of non-uniform reviewer judgement on every review.
