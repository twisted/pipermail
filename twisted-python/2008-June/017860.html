This is a feeling a few other people have expressed. It's  
understandable to feel like this is &quot;lawyering up&quot; the community, but  
it's important to be pragmatic about the environment we're in right  
now. Free software/open source has made a lot of ground in the last  
few years, but I think it's fair to say that the GPL/MIT/etc licenses  
still have yet to be truly tested.

For some projects, like, say Firefox, the threat of potential  
infringers is almost nonexistent, since practically *everyone* knows  
what firefox is, and that would be a huge community for a potential  
infringer to piss off. Nonetheless, the Mozilla foundation has several  
trademark registrations.

Also, did you catch the part where this trademark *would* be held by a  
non-profit? If you check out glyph's first post to this thread, the  
Twisted trademarks would be formally held by the Software Freedom  
Conservancy.
