The great thing about the Twisted Community Code project is that you  
don't need any particular approval from anyone to add your code. If  
you think what you have might be of use to someone, whether it's for  
production use or just as a learning tool, you should consider  
creating a TX subproject.

There are other options as well. If you feel your code doesn't warrant  
the overhead of a full project (e.g., you don't see yourself having  
time to respond to bug requests or create blueprints, etc.), you  
should be able to create a personal Bazaar branch to store your code  
in, which you can then assign to the TX superproject.

This probably won't get as many eyeballs, since it won't be on the  
subproject list, but it's a good way to get your code out there in an  
easily accessible place. Plus, given the nature of Bazaar, anyone who  
wishes will be able to work with your code in their own branch.
