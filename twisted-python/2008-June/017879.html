IANAL, but I did read a lot about this on slashdot ;-)...

When such a dispute occurs, you have to prove that you've been  
performing due diligence in protecting your trademark. I don't think  
it's necessary to send the aforementioned projects C&amp;Ds quite yet, but  
they should be contacted and told of our intentions to protect the  
Twisted trademark.

IIRC, this is to prevent people from registering everything they can  
think of, and then suing the next person to use that mark. It would be  
nice if we had something like that for patents...
