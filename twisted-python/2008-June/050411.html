Unless I misunderstood the first mail, I don't think this is what  
Kevin meant . I believe what he is looking for could better be termed  
&quot;best practice&quot; (it is probably the reference to &quot;industrial grade&quot; in  
the subject that is misleading). This is something I've struggled with  
as well with respect to Twisted. Twisted is large and complex and in  
many cases there are several ways to achieve the same functionality.  
Frequently, it isn't easy to figure out the &quot;best&quot; approach or even  
the generally accepted approach. As Kevin says, the documentation   
does make obscure references to there being some &quot;way you usually do  
this&quot;, without coming out and saying what that way is. All of the code  
reviews and unit tests in the world aren't going to catch  
unconventional uses of a library unless one of the reviewers knows  
better...

I'd offer some advice of my own, but I'm not sure even now that I use  
Twisted properly - at best I have something that works, and as all of  
my work is experimental that has been good enough.
