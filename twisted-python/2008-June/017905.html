</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Production quality software is hard; a good start is having code

</I>&gt;<i>Unless I misunderstood the first mail, I don't think this is what  Kevin

</I>&gt;<i>subject that is misleading). This is something I've struggled with  as well 
</I>&gt;<i>with respect to Twisted. Twisted is large and complex and in  many cases 
</I>&gt;<i>there are several ways to achieve the same functionality.  Frequently, it 
</I>&gt;<i>isn't easy to figure out the &quot;best&quot; approach or even  the generally accepted 
</I>&gt;<i>approach. As Kevin says, the documentation   does make obscure references to 
</I>&gt;<i>there being some &quot;way you usually do  this&quot;, without coming out and saying 
</I>&gt;<i>what that way is. All of the code  reviews and unit tests in the world 
</I>&gt;<i>aren't going to catch  unconventional uses of a library unless one of the 
</I>&gt;<i>reviewers knows  better...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'd offer some advice of my own, but I'm not sure even now that I use 
</I>&gt;<i>Twisted properly - at best I have something that works, and as all of  my 
</I>&gt;<i>work is experimental that has been good enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
A way to get better answers to this question is to file tickets for each
place in the documentation which makes this unsubstantiated claim.  Then
the documentation can be improved, either by replacing the code in the
documentation which doesn't conform to best practices with code which does
conform to best practices, or by removing the claim if it's just so much
B.S.

This helps everyone who reads the documentation in the future, and it makes
for a *much* easier question to answer than &quot;What are the best practices for
developing Twisted applications?&quot; (which I don't even know where to begin to
answer, unless you've got about a week).
