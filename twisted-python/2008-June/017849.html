Twisted supports processes on Windows.  Not all of the arguments to
spawnProcess are supported, such as the arbitrary file descriptor
option, but for basic process management it works alright.  It's not
as efficient on Windows as on POSIX, but it also doesn't suffer the
SIGCHLD issues POSIX suffers from. :)

As long as you're a bit careful and test your code on Windows, you
should do alright.

Processes on OS X work almost as well as they do on Linux.  I believe
there is still a problem with PTYs, most likely due to a kernel bug.
It is, however, quite rare.  Linux doesn't really have any known issues.
I've never tested on AIX, and AIX isn't a &quot;supported&quot; platform - meaning
we have no buildslave for it, and regular testing of any kind is not
done on it.  It may work, or it may not.  If you can supply a buildslave,
we can try to make it a supported platform.
