</I>
Not really. Even the 'tx' prefix is just a suggestion. I think adding  
the prefix is a good idea if your project has a generic name, like a  
protocol, but it's up to you. Using it is a nice show of 'community  
solidarity', but I know I have a couple of projects I hope to add soon  
where it would just look or sound weird.

&gt;<i> Any suggestions or guidelines on how such packages should leverage  
</I>&gt;<i> setuptools, stuff like that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be very useful to have all of these packages  
</I>&gt;<i> install in a similar fashion, though of course, it wouldn't be  
</I>&gt;<i> practical (or advisable) to try and enforce this in any way.  But I  
</I>&gt;<i> do think it would be good to have a set of guidelines posted  
</I>&gt;<i> someplace saying &quot;here is the recommended way to set up a TX package&quot;.
</I>
Agreed. I think deployment options like this are best decided on a per- 
project basis, since TX will hopefully be a home for example code and  
works-in-progress as well as true project releases.

Still, I think we can all agree that projects should be installable  
using distutils at the very least. The key thing here is that for most  
projects you should be able to &quot;python setup.py install&quot; and be done  
with it.

Does anyone have any other suggestions? If we can come up with a list  
of suggested criteria, I'll write up a spec to add to the TX blueprints.
