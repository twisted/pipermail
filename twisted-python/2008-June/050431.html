<PRE>Thank you all for your replies.

@Christian:
I should have mentioned that. The current directory is in the pythonpath. In
the variable PYHTONPATH the dot is set and when I walk through the
filesystem, starting python from different locations, the current path is
always set in sys.path. Hence, I asssume that PythonPath is set correctly.
So your suggestion, what I thought would work
&gt;<i>  cd \original_project
</I>&gt;<i>  trial package_to_test
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  cd \modified_project
</I>&gt;<i>  trial package_to_test
</I>does actually not work. Who knows why...

@Terry:
&gt;<i> Torsten, you say your code doesn't work when you have PYTHONPATH set. Can
</I>you be more specific? Send us the output showing it not working, etc?

Actually I'd love to do that, but I really don't know what to send. When I
run the trial as suggested by Christian (see above), the trial runs every
time for the modified package, even if I am in \original_project. How do I
know this? Well, the trial fails at the point where the modified version
fails. If I delete the modified version from the pythonpath, everything runs
fine.


I have never really used a version control system I have to admit. I thought
of control systems to log changes which can in case of severe damage or what
ever reason be made undone. But if I can execute different versions of the
project, e.g. in my case the initial version and the last modified, just by
saying run this one or that one, I am glad to use it. Can this be done
(excuse my probably dumb question)? Can someone please give me catchword to
search for? As I looked briefly in the bazaar guide
(<A HREF="http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/bzr.dev/en/user-guide/index.html">http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/bzr.dev/en/user-guide/index.html</A>) I wasn't able
to find anything helpful. 

Thanks again for your help! I really appreciate it!

Cheers,
Torsten
