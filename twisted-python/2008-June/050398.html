</I>BTW, Phil, are there any established guidelines/conventions for the &quot;TX&quot;
packages other than &quot;start your project name with a 'tx'&quot;?

Any suggestions or guidelines on how such packages should leverage
setuptools, stuff like that?

I think it would be very useful to have all of these packages install in a
similar fashion, though of course, it wouldn't be practical (or advisable)
to try and enforce this in any way.  But I do think it would be good to have
a set of guidelines posted someplace saying &quot;here is the recommended way to
set up a TX package&quot;.
