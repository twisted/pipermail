you forgot option number 4, which is what we ended up doing.

Put a python binding in over the Apple code and use it integrated into 
Twisted.
Plus you get to use it outside Twisted as well :-)

I like this option as Apple's mDNS code is becoming very solid.  Are the python bindings you mention available somewhere?  I have thought about using mDNS with twisted for a project so any examples you can offer would be great.
