Please use twisted-web for questions like this in the future -- it's
what we set it up for.

twisted.web.woven.page.Page loads the template and parses it into a
DOM at initialization time. If you want to dynamically construct a
template in wchild_submit, which needs to return a Resource instance
(which Page is), you should construct and return a new page instance
with your dynamic template:


def wchild_submit(self, request):

	return page.Page(template="""<<html>HELLO!<</html>""")
