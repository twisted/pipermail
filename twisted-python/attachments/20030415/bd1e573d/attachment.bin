<excerpt><fixed>Hi,


I've been sporadically developing some code for a tic-tac-toe client
and 

server upon which I intended to base a tutorial. I've not got around
to 

starting the document, but I'd be happy to make the code available to
you 

and/or any other interested parties.


Thanks,

Joe

Joe,


Count me in! I've been looking everywhere for code and a tutorial like
this, so I would very much appreciate a gander at your code.


I am building an application on top of a socket server that speaks
Flash-friendly XML. Even with my minimal knowledge of Twisted I have
built a working example on top of the simple echo server. I have a
nagging feeling that I should be looking at PB instead. 


The next step is to add persistence with database calls. Working in a
strict asynchronous framework is all new to me. But exciting!


Thanks for all the good work,


Doug Goodwin
