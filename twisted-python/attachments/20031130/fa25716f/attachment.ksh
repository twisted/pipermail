Ok,

I've got something kinda working now.  I think I need to do a bunch more reading now as it looks like I've found a framework for my project :)  Now I need to get much better at Python and the twisted library.  I guess I'll try dropping in on IRC channel as I have questions.  I'm not a big IRC guy, do I just sign in and ask away?

OLIVER
