Hi 
Thanks a lot for all public and private replies, got it confirmed so I'll continue with my first setup.
Made a X3D model this evening of some instruments and a human, with possibility to alter text, meter value, human: arms+ hand and legs + feets to interface to twisted - scripts.
Have a simulab model of a automotive drivetrain with automatic transmission and UDP I/O running in Pseudo-RealTIme.
So I'm on making twisted scripts to interface the X3D model with the simulink model.

Yes.  That is what Twisted _is_.

Have you looked at the "finger" tutorial?
