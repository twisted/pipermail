&gt; &gt; Speaking of headers, there's also a bug with CGI handling:
&gt; &gt; http://www.twistedmatrix.com/users/carmstro.twistd/static/viewcvs/
&gt; &gt; cgi/viewcvs.cgi
&gt; &gt; This is supposed to redirect to the same URL + &quot;/&quot;, but twisted.web
&gt; &gt; doesn't like that. I may take a look at this later tonight.
&gt; 
&gt; Could I get a copy of the cgi, to see what's going
&gt; on with it?

Well, I don't think the problem is the CGI, because it seems to work 
everywhere else (the CGI is ViewCVS, which is used on sourceforge and the like).
So apparenty there is a bug with twisted.web's CGI handling..


&gt; I tried to just use telnet, and type in the HTTP code, and I got back:
&gt; [~ bwinton] telnet www.twistedmatrix.com 80
&gt; Trying 64.123.27.105...
&gt; Connected to www.twistedmatrix.com.
&gt; Escape character is '^]'.
&gt; GET HTTP/1.1 /users/carmstro.twistd/static/viewcvs/cgi/viewcvs.cgi/

Heh, the syntax for GET is &quot;GET &lt;path&gt; HTTP/1.1&quot;. try it that way =)

&gt; Which is different than what I get from Mozilla.  Oddness.
&gt; 
&gt; Later,
&gt; Blake.
