I call your attention to:


This was quoted in the Docs on the TwistedMatrix web site.


Persistent Data in the Factory


</bigger></bigger></bigger></fontfamily></bold><fontfamily><param>Arial</param><bigger><bigger>Since
the Protocol instance is recreated each time the connection is made,
the client needs some way to keep track of data that should be
persisted. In the case of ircLogBot.py:
(</bigger></bigger></fontfamily><fixed><fontfamily><param>Courier New</param><x-tad-bigger>LogBot.log()</x-tad-bigger></fontfamily></fixed><fontfamily><param>Arial</param><bigger><bigger>
just logs the data to the file object stored in
</bigger></bigger></fontfamily><fixed><fontfamily><param>Courier New</param><x-tad-bigger>LogBot.file</x-tad-bigger></fontfamily></fixed><fontfamily><param>Arial</param><bigger><bigger>)


it references a LogBot.log() call....   but I checked in ircLogBot.py
and there is NO log()

method,  nor is there one in any of the other classes it inherits from.


Would it be too much of a bother if I were to ask anyone about this
descrepancy?
