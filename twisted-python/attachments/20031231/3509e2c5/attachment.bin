Below is a piece of code from 
<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><bigger><bigger>ircLogBot.py</bigger></bigger></fontfamily> 
in the examples section of the

Twisted release.


It makes reference to a "channel" - What is a channel.

I assume that "sys.argv[1]" when passed into main()

must be a "channel"


Of course the person who wrote this module just had no inclination to

actually tell anyone how to use it.    I know the 2nd argument is a
file

name or path,  but what is a "channel"....


I know I probably am really lame for asking these kinds of 

questions,  but i left my crystal ball on the planet venus,  and

can't read the mind of the person who wrote this module.


class LogBotFactory(protocol.ClientFactory):

    """A factory for LogBots.


    A new protocol instance will be created each time we connect to
the server.

    """


    # the class of the protocol to build

    protocol = LogBot


    def __init__(self, channel, filename):

        self.channel = channel

        self.filename = filename


    def clientConnectionLost(self, connector, reason):

        """If we get disconnected, reconnect to server."""

        connector.connect()


    def clientConnectionFailed(self, connector, reason):

        print "connection failed:", reason

        reactor.stop()



if __name__ == '__main__':

    # create factory protocol and application

    import sys

    f = LogBotFactory(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])


    # connect factory to this host and port

    reactor.connectTCP("irc.freenode.net", 6667, f)


    # run bot

    reactor.run()
