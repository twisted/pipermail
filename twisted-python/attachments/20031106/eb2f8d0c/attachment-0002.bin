Furthermore, if I can get enough knowledge on this, I would be happy

Handling form input in a way which is both very abstract and easy for
the programmer to use without a lot of edge cases has turned out to be
very difficult. As you may have heard, 'nevow' is the name of a new
exploratory implementation of the woven ideas which will eventually
become woven 2.0.  One of the goals of nevow is to take the ideas
originally explored in twisted.python.formmethod and
twisted.web.woven.form and re-implement them so they are cleaner,
easier to use and extend, and have fewer edge cases. The new,
in-development modules are nevow.formless and nevow.freeform.


Formless is a module which allows you to annotate object properties
and method parameters with types (By declaring that the 'foo' property
is a String, and the "bar" method takes two Integers, for example).
Freeform is a module which uses this type information to automatically
render forms on the web, perform input validation and form error
rendering, and ultimately call methods on your objects or set
properties on your objects.


I am at this very moment doing a lot of freeform development, so now
would be a good time to raise your use cases, your expectations about
using a system which renders and validates web forms, etc.
