<excerpt>Documentation is a serious sore point of many Python
projects, including

Twisted, and I'd like to encourage anyone who has the time to do so to

write and maintain documentation, especially HOWTOs and tutorials. 
(The

API documentation is passable as reference material, although it too
needs

work.)


</excerpt>I currently operate on the MacOS X architecture and if I can
get Twisted working on its platform I will be more than happy to
document it for further use.

</color><excerpt>In addition to the Windows documentation, it might be
nice to have a

slightly more GUI frontend to Twisted for windows users, who don't
have a

very good command line interface.  I really don't know where to start
with

such a tool though, because the GUI seems so open-ended to me, but if
you

can think of an easier process while you're writing documentation,
please

suggest that to the list.

What about the use of Wx Windows, since it has the WxPython API
extensions, that way one wouldn't have to worry about reinventing the
wheel used to work with X or Windows.<color><param>0000,0000,DEB7</param>
