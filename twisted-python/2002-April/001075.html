Glad to hear you're giving it a try.  twisted.web has been lacking in
direction for a little while, but hopefully Donovan will be answering
some of these questions in depth.  Take a look at his &quot;Blog&quot; application
in CVS...

&gt;<i> The thing is, from the docs I've read (and that's pretty much all in the 
</I>&gt;<i> distro) I'm still confused about what goes where and what to use. It seems 
</I>&gt;<i> the Twisted Framework can be used for just about anything except make coffee!
</I>
Yes, indeed.  All you have to do in order to use Twisted for something
is write lots of code ;-).

&gt;<i> I think there-in lies the &quot;problem&quot;. It's overwhelming for the new user. It 
</I>&gt;<i> would be nice if I could make a step-by-step tutorial. And I _will_ -  if 
</I>&gt;<i> only I can understand it first. When I first got the &quot;hang&quot; of zope, I made a 
</I>&gt;<i> tutorial that takes the user from zero to a functioning publicly postable 
</I>&gt;<i> job-board with searching facilities. It illustrated zopes potential to a 
</I>&gt;<i> newbie using some basic components (custom zclasses).
</I>
Step-by-step tutorials to &quot;twisted&quot; are probably a bad idea.  If you are
looking to write web applications, that's one specific facet of Twisted,
but keep in mind that it can be used at multiple levels; writing a web
application in Twisted is very different from Zope; we do not offer a
comprehensive web development framework.  (Yet.)

&gt;<i> I'd like to make a similar tutorial for Twisted. If I can hack it, that is...
</I>
HOORAY.  We need a good writer who can dedicate some time to this.  I
hope that we can be responsive enough in answering your questions :).

&gt;<i> Basically, I'd have a bunch of classes, each has a &quot;view&quot; method (&quot;display()&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> in Twisted?) and some other methods that would implement some kind of set and 
</I>&gt;<i> get functionality to the objects. (I have no idea how to do &quot;searching&quot; in 
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted at all). Btw...how do I implement persistence? 
</I>
As it stands, all your objects will be dumped into one big pickle; so
just implement __getstate__ if you need to do something special;
otherwise, don't :-).

&gt;<i> I have a job-board instance that contains multiple job-posting instances. So 
</I>&gt;<i> that when you call the job-board's &quot;view&quot;, it iterates over the job-posting 
</I>&gt;<i> instances there-in and calls their individual &quot;view&quot; methods. The job-board's 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;view&quot; method creates a skeleton where the individual job-posting instances' 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;view&quot; method &quot;slots in&quot;.
</I>
Are you looking to back this with a database or just in-memory objects?

&gt;<i> In zope, I used zclasses to implement it (the tutorial was a zclass tutorial).
</I>
In twisted, you would likely use regular Python classes to implement it;
most likely (at this point) from twisted.web.widgets; although
the new twisted.web.domtemplate is the future.

&gt;<i> So ZODB pretty much took care of persistence automatically for me. How do I 
</I>&gt;<i> do object persistence in Twisted? 
</I>
(See above, and...) if you are looking for something like ZODB, Twisted
doesn't offer it.  Our approach is: either you need a database, or you
need objects.  If you need an object database with all the attendant
trappings, using ZODB is probably your best bet; but if you need just a
reasonable quantity of objects persisted, just use the Application class
as the root of your system, and have it automatically persist.

If you require a relational databse, see twisted.enterprise; especially
twisted.enterprise.adbapi and twisted.enterprise.row.  These are still
works in progress but there is a basic outline there for how a
database-backed application would be written.

&gt;<i> Also...what is &quot;coil&quot;? And how do I use it? It seems to have the same sorta 
</I>&gt;<i> modules that is in twisted.tap but I can't figure it out. From the 
</I>&gt;<i> literature, I think coil (or is it plugin?) is Twisted's way of doing zope's 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;python-based Products&quot;. Am I wrong?
</I>
That's pretty close to accurate; except for the fact that Products are
specifically web services and COIL provides configuration for
*everything*.

&gt;<i> Is there an analogous thingamajig to zope's zodb in Twisted?
</I>
No.  Nor do we have plans for it.  At one point, I thought that it might
be possible to improve upon the ZODB; after implementing some prototypes
and trying to devise a strategy I came to the conclusion that ZODB is
pretty darn good for what it does, and that the perceived deficiencies I
wanted to correct are inherent to object databases.  Still, I find that
when one has a large amount of data to persist, a non-OODBMS strategy is
best.  I do have a peculiar perspective though, because the datasets I
have to work with are usually either VERY large or VERY small.

Still, ZODB is good at that.  itamar's work on integrating Twisted and
Zope will hopefully make that easy.

I don't think that feeling ever goes away -- I've been *writing* Twisted
code for two years and I still feel dazed ;-).  Maybe you can help by
documenting some of this stuff properly!
