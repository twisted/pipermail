Hi, Tim! [An eerie chorous of the Twisted minions' voices chants a beat

&gt;<i> I experimented briefly with twisted several months ago. After banging

</I>&gt;<i> within a twisted web?
</I>
That was originally the plan.  However (*nudge to dp here...*) none of
us have had a good experience with ZPT yet, and very few of us have had
experience with ZPT at all.  If I had any major web projects coming up
in the future, I'd probably implement it myself just to give it a try,
but my work seems to be taking me down a decidedly non-web path for the
time being.  (And those web things I do wouldn't be sufficiently aided
by ZPT to justify the effort.)

&gt;<i> I also saw some mention of using WebWare as a presentation layer. Are
</I>&gt;<i> there any examples of using WebWare with twisted web.
</I>
No.  I've mostly decided against webware, since it has a rather naive
worldview and I've been unimpressed with the software technically.  My
impression of the webware _project_ is that it's very well run; their
documentation and support by *far* put Twisted to shame.   However, that
project is producing an application server I'm not too interested in.

Donovan Preston has recently become the de-facto web guru for Twisted,
and his work so far (twisted.web.domtemplate) I find fascinating; it
seems to have most of the advantages of ZPT, but it is a lot simpler.  I
have even somehow managed to coerce him into writing a little bit of
documentation, currently in CVS...

Check that out and let me know if it solves your templating issues.
