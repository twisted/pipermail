The reason that this isn't automatic is because PB has the option to
*do* stuff when you send state to other people (such as tracking the
fact that they have said state).  In most simple cases, such as yours,
it's not necessary to completely replicate PB's object-copying
semantics; however, this sort of short-cut for simplicity's sake is not
something the framework can make a decision about for you; trying to run
certain kinds of remote code locally would break it.  (Think about P2P
applications that try to connect to each other by determining the other
end of the connection's IP)

The reason I introduced callRemote was to facilitate this sort of
thing.  Since the only message you expect your object to respond to is
&quot;callRemote&quot;, simply implement &quot;callRemote&quot; on a pseudo-ViewPoint,
(similarly to twisted.spread.util.LocalAsRemote -- maybe
LocalAsViewPoint?)
 
&gt;<i> I don't know, maybe PB just isn't quite as transparent as I desire it to

</I>&gt;<i> later.
</I>
PB isn't supposed to be transparent.  I think I've made my argument
against transparency before, but it boils down to what I said above;
sometimes, transparency is wrong.  In the cases where it's not, it's
easy to fake using Twisted.
