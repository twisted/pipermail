I don't know about its support for Mac OS9, but as far as Mac OS X goes 
it seems to be very far along.  It did have some assertion errors when 
running the demo, about a missing menu resource, but they were 
nonfatal.  I think it did crash once when I tried to close something, 
but nonetheless it seemed to be pretty far along.  Visually it looked 
pretty damn close to correct, some of the spacing on the buttons was a 
little off, but even IE has problems with that.  This is from the latest 
CVS, so any of these errors could be works in progress.  The Aqua 
version of Tk isn't really that great either, I've seen it crash and 
I've seen a lot of visual errors.

I've done gtk+glade for linux, it works pretty well.. except for the 
fact that the glade tool is terrible to use, I spent more time  fighting 
bugs in the glade designer than it would've taken for me to mock it up 
in gimp/photoshop and then do the XML or python code by hand.

</I>
I don't have experience with Boa Constructor, but it sounds like it's 
better off than glade, from my experience with that ;)

Qt's license is great for X11, but I'm not willing to pay &gt; $1000 (per 
developer+platform combination) to use it for open source work on 
anything else, it really leaves it in a worse spot than GTK or 
wxWindows.  I'd rather donate that money to the wxWindows team or to 
have the GUI portion rewritten with a native library.
