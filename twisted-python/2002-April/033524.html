the term &quot;unparse&quot; is taken strait from the Python urlparse module. I've
sorta followed the same api. I also have a &quot;netlocparse.py&quot; that
parses/unparses the netlock part ([user[:passwd]@]host[:port]) which the
urlparse module neglects to do anything with.

&gt;<i> The parsing bits also look useful, especially the date parsing.

</I>
I'm using a pure-python implementation by Andy Eskilsson... I forget where I
found it. It's a bit longer than lsparse.py so I won't post it here, email
me directly if you want a copy.

&gt;<i> I don't think uid/gid should be numeric or translated to local names when
</I>&gt;<i> parsing -- ProFTPD at least returns names, and besides remote uids may not

</I>
The point of this was to return a proper stat tupple, which always uses
numeric uid/gid values. The whole local vs remote uid issue is messy... this
code will attempt the conversions with sensible fallbacks if it fails.
Generaly, the gid/uid info is useless because of the remote vs local issue
anyway, but they are included for completeness.

&gt;<i> Also, I'm curious as to how much more reliable this is at parsing wacky
</I>&gt;<i> formats than the regular expression in
</I>&gt;<i> twisted.protocols.ftp.FTPFileListingProtocol in CVS...
</I>
It's probably pretty unforgiving... it was designed exclusively to
parse/unparse ls style info.

This plus more is part of my osVFS package, which is a drop-in replacement
for for the standard os module that replaces all the file interface routines
with an Virtual File System. I already have working fake-root, mountable,
and ftp VFS backends, but I want to include a caching mixin using my
GCache.py module before I release it. I should just get off my butt and do
it...
