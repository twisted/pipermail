I'd say that tuple is pretty standard terminology.  It's used quite 
heavily in PostgreSQL's source code for example, and I've heard mention 
of it in reference to common lisp.. Other things probably use it, I 
don't think it had anything to do with python, I think python's use of 
it is just the most prolific.
