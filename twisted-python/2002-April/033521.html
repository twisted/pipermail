<PRE>On Mon, 08 Apr 2002, Glyph Lefkowitz did violence to a keyboard thusly:

&gt;<i> I just checked in a substantial refactoring and change to Jelly,
</I>&gt;<i> finalizing what I think Jelly ought to look like in PB's wire protocol. 
</I>&gt;<i> Before I declare that it is well and truly standard, however, there are
</I>&gt;<i> a few things I'd like to resolve, and I'd be interested to hear a few
</I>&gt;<i> opinions on them...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1: use of the word &quot;tuple&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jelly uses the word &quot;tuple&quot; on the wire, which is fairly
</I>&gt;<i> Python-specific.  Really it ought to be &quot;immutable-list&quot; or something
</I>&gt;<i> similar (perhaps leaving the door open for more immutable types in the
</I>&gt;<i> future?).  Thoughts on this, especially from implementors in other
</I>&gt;<i> languages?
</I>
More immutable types would be nice, yes. (Oz, for example, has 'records'
which in effect are immutable dicts.) I dont know if there's any
advantage to making 'immutable' a separate protocol element or if such
data structures should just be identified as such in their name.... for
that matter. 'tuple' isn't the worst thing you could call it -- i dont
think jelly would suffer from being called unabashedly python-centric.
:<i>)
</I>
&gt;<i> 2: jellying of arguments/kwargs
</I>&gt;<i> A couple of possible small improvements come to mind:
</I>
&gt;<i> * provide alternate forms of proto_message which alternatively do or
</I>&gt;<i>   do not send arguments, keyword args, or either
</I>
To my mind, this seems the cleanest way to solve it.

&gt;<i> 4: always assume exactly one reference
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> some work is probably wasted right now in maintaining distributed
</I>&gt;<i> reference counts; the peer really only cares whether the other side has
</I>&gt;<i> a reference or it doesn't.  The one place that this is a little weird is
</I>&gt;<i> the decache/uncache handshake.
</I>
well, my opinion on enforcing single referece counts has been expressed
before :) this would be quite nice but i'm unsure how it would interact
with Python semantics... would jelly refuse to send refs to objects that
it had already sent?
