<PRE>I believe common meaning of &quot;tuple&quot; extends beyond computing
and means something like element of the cartesian product.
The dictionary definition below seems to come from a computing
dictionary and assumes a strongly typed language.
The online Merriam-Webster just says:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
One entry found for -tuple.
Main Entry: -tu&#183;ple
Pronunciation: &quot;t&amp;-p&amp;l, &quot;t&#252;-
Function: noun combining form
Etymology: quintuple, sextuple
:<i> set of (so many) elements -- usually used of sets with ordered
</I>elements &lt;the ordered 2-tuple (a, b)&gt;
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Which seems compatible with Python usage.
I think the Python usage is consistent with
programming/math uses I am familiar with.
It is even consistent with the dictionary definition
given below;
it is the definition 'list' that is incompatible,
since there is no same type restriction
on python list elements.
However, all untyped/dynamically typed languages
have list types without it.
However, in most languages lists are linked structures:
python lists correspond to vectors/arrays in other languages.

 &gt; &gt; &gt; 1: use of the word &quot;tuple&quot;.
 &gt; 
 &gt; &gt; I'd say that tuple is pretty standard terminology.  It's used quite 
 &gt; &gt; heavily in PostgreSQL's source code for example, and I've heard mention 
 &gt; &gt; of it in reference to common lisp.. Other things probably use it, I 
 &gt; &gt; don't think it had anything to do with python, I think python's use of 
 &gt; &gt; it is just the most prolific.
 &gt; 
 &gt; dictionaries define &quot;tuple&quot; as:
 &gt; 
 &gt;     &quot;In functional languages, a data object containing two or more
 &gt;     components. Also known as a product type or pair, triple, quad, etc.
 &gt;     Tuples of different sizes have different types, in contrast to lists
 &gt;     where the type is independent of the length. The components of a
 &gt;     tuple may be of different types whereas all elements of a list have
 &gt;     the same type.&quot;
 &gt; 
 &gt; This is not quite what Python means.  PostgreSQL defines tuple as:
 &gt; 
 &gt;     &quot;an individual state of a row; each UPDATE of a row creates a new
 &gt;     tuple for the same logical row&quot;.
 &gt; 
 &gt; In Python, it means simply &quot;a list which is immutable&quot;.  I think that
 &gt; these three definitions are sufficiently incompatible that one should
 &gt; not use the word in a vocabulary for a protocol which is supposed to be
 &gt; cross-langauge.
