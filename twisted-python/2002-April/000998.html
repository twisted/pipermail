<PRE>I just checked in a substantial refactoring and change to Jelly,
finalizing what I think Jelly ought to look like in PB's wire protocol. 
Before I declare that it is well and truly standard, however, there are
a few things I'd like to resolve, and I'd be interested to hear a few
opinions on them...

1: use of the word &quot;tuple&quot;.

Jelly uses the word &quot;tuple&quot; on the wire, which is fairly
Python-specific.  Really it ought to be &quot;immutable-list&quot; or something
similar (perhaps leaving the door open for more immutable types in the
future?).  Thoughts on this, especially from implementors in other
languages?

2: jellying of arguments/kwargs

Arguments and keyword arguments to methods are currently serialized in
their native Python form; a tuple and a dict.  This is probably not the
most natural way to serialize args in other languages (especially those
so deficient as not to have keyword arguments).  A couple of possible
small improvements come to mind:

    * provide alternate forms of proto_message which alternatively do or
do not send arguments, keyword args, or either

    * call jelly on the tuple/dict, but decompose them such that the
argument format does not include the leading &quot;tuple&quot; or &quot;dictionary&quot;
string (to make life easier for PB authors who do not want to implement
Jelly initially)

    * jelly the tuple and the dict together in one pass (this is really
more like a bug, since objects referred to once as an arg and once as a
kw arg will be serialized twice...)

3: eliminate &quot;cachemessage&quot; somehow

This is really an eyesore, but I can't easily think how to get rid of
it.  Perhaps cache IDs could be component somehow, not just integers?

4: always assume exactly one reference

some work is probably wasted right now in maintaining distributed
reference counts; the peer really only cares whether the other side has
a reference or it doesn't.  The one place that this is a little weird is
the decache/uncache handshake.

I can't think of any other issues to address before we call it final. 
Anyone?
