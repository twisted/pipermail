<PRE>&gt;<i> We are trying to move forwards towards a 1.0 release, with as many of 
</I>&gt;<i> the APIs as possible in a stable state (obviously some parts are not 
</I>&gt;<i> going to be stable).
</I>&gt;<i> Most of all however, we need test code and documentation. Please 
</I>&gt;<i> everyone - join in and help. It's a great way to learn, and few things 
</I>&gt;<i> beat the fuzzy, warm feeling of having another 10 tests pass.

Excellent... I having been wanting to write documentation on Twisted for 
a while, and my interest has increased due to my large interest in Reality.

The only problem that I have when trying to get involved in this aspect 
is the needed directions from the people running the show. I would like 
to know what you need documented and how you would like the docs to 
look. (info about the system in general, tutorials, as well as a listing 
of API's and the information needed for programmers to use them).

I consider myself a good writer, but this is not my project (I would 
just like to assist with it), therefore, I would like to know how the 
owners of the project (project leads) would like things done (ie, I am 
all for being the peon =).

Regards,

-M.
