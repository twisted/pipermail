Great!

Hm. I don't remember if there's any important reason why the Interface
and ComponentArchitecture packages depend on python 2.2. I suspect that
there isn't. Assuming that there is no important reason for them to
depend on 2.2, I'd be happy to see them work with Python 2 or, if necessary
Python 1.5. Perhaps, as Phillip suggests, it would be best to focus on
interfaces. I ended up doing a bunch of cleanup and refactoring in the
Interface package for Zope 3 and it would be nice to make that available
for earlier versions of Python, especially Python 2.
 
&gt;<i> So, this is what I think I'll do - I'll refactor the minimum
</I>&gt;<i> implementation Twisted's uses, making sure that it uses the same
</I>&gt;<i> semantics and syntax as Zope3's (e.g. __implements__ being a
</I>&gt;<i> tuple/singelton instead of lists - why was this made inconsistent in
</I>&gt;<i> Zope, anyway?).
</I>
Inconsistent? With what? Tuples and interfaces are allowed so that:

  - it's easy to spell implementing one interface:

      __implements__ = Ifoo

    which is very common

  - make it easy to compose implementation specifications:

      __implements__ = IFoo, some_base_class.__implements__

  - Make the specifications immutable to facilitate caching.

&gt;<i> If Zope3 is importable then Zope.CA's implementation
</I>&gt;<i> will be used instead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any issues anyone can think of in doing this?
</I>
CA is a lot younger than Interface, so it's still changing quite
a bit. You might want to wait a little longer for the changes to
settle out.

Let us know what you want to do and we'll be willing to port the
software back.
