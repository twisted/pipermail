<PRE>&gt;<i> Not to mention the fact that inevitably, you probably are going to want some
</I>&gt;<i> security on those connections, which means TLS, which means individual crypto
</I>&gt;<i> connections.
</I>
If there is a need for encryption, then yes, .. but it's not always needed

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe the best model for this kind of high-volume reliable-multicast-over-
</I>&gt;<i> unicast is a spanning tree, like what IRC uses for server-to-server
</I>
Ok. Makes sense. I see .. could have frontend nodes, which act as aggregators
condensing the messages on many incoming connections into 1 uplink TCP
connection to a backend node .. or a hierarchy.

This is quite interesting .. for I am now beginning to see why Google is
pushing the discussion on WebSocket multiplexing extension on Hybi;)

Until now, I thought that would be primarily because Chrome has a
process per tab design .. but that's probably only one reaon. The cloud
side being the other one ..

&gt;<i> communication.  If you have 100,000 concurrent, active connections, you're
</I>&gt;<i> already probably beyond the CPU constraints of a single machine.  So have your
</I>
Not really. I've been testing up to 180k connections on a 2 core virtual machine
and when doing PubSub over those (dispatching 1 msg to all 180k) .. CPU load
isn't maxed out .. but I'm hitting a limit of around 20k/s dispatched msgs.

My suspicion is it's probably more interrupt/syscall overhead bound ..

&gt;<i> clients connect (via round-robin DNS, or whatever other mechanism makes
</I>&gt;<i> sense) to a variety of different servers, then have the servers connected to each
</I>&gt;<i> other in a pattern such that one server tells ten friends, and they each tell ten
</I>&gt;<i> friends, and so on, until each server is only responsible for spewing out data to
</I>&gt;<i> a reasonable number of connections (5000 maybe?).
</I>
5k is much too low .. would require too many servers. My target is 200k per node
and have as high as possible msgs/s dispatch rate.

Probably a design with frontend nodes aggregating TCP connections is inevitable ..

Thanks!
