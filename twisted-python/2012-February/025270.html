<PRE>Hello,

I'm hoping to wrap up work on ticket #3844 [1] before the next release of Twisted, however there are a few quirks in the small DSL used for specifying text with attributes (see the ticket for some commentary on these.)

I decided to look more closely at what happens with Conch (which is where the DSL originally came from and has remained largely unchanged) in some of the places I was having problems with the IRC formatting. I was struck by something that looks like it is rather incorrect behaviour (on Twisted trunk as of 2012/2/22 and Twisted 11.0.0 on Debian):

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from twisted.conch.insults.helper import CharacterAttribute
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from twisted.conch.insults.text import flatten, attributes as A
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> flatten(A.normal['hello', A.bold[' world '], 'quux'], CharacterAttribute())
</I>'hello\x1b[1m world quux'

My expectations are that only &quot; world &quot; will be marked up with bold attributes, since it is the only piece of content in the &quot;bold&quot; attribute, while &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;quux&quot; both appear in normal text, i.e. without any additional markup. Looking at the output you can see that &quot;hello&quot; appears as normal text and then &quot; world quux&quot; appears in bold.

Is this the expected behaviour? There are no tests that actually test this particular case, as far as I can tell, except for twisted.conch.test.test_text.EfficiencyTestCase but that is marked as &quot;todo&quot; (the tests themselves do indeed fail.) While the name of this test case indicates tests for efficient markup, as far as I can tell these tests also assume (and fail) that the structure is flattened the same way I was expecting.

Any guidance would be appreciated.

Regards
