Not to mention the fact that inevitably, you probably are going to want some security on those connections, which means TLS, which means individual crypto connections.

I believe the best model for this kind of high-volume reliable-multicast-over-unicast is a spanning tree, like what IRC uses for server-to-server communication.  If you have 100,000 concurrent, active connections, you're already probably beyond the CPU constraints of a single machine.  So have your clients connect (via round-robin DNS, or whatever other mechanism makes sense) to a variety of different servers, then have the servers connected to each other in a pattern such that one server tells ten friends, and they each tell ten friends, and so on, until each server is only responsible for spewing out data to a reasonable number of connections (5000 maybe?).
