Why can't anyone post just a teeny little bit of information on how to 
tie all this
together?

One of my main problems is where to put my code.   Do I put it in the 
factory class,
or do I put it in the Client class?   One always points to the other.   
I suppose it don't really matter,
but I'm sure the author(s) of twisted have their OWN ideas of where to 
put their specific code,
but they sure don't seem to have been very sucessful in conveying this 
info to others.

I know it's mostly due to my lack of knowledge,  but the only part 
that's really well documented
is the Twisted Web section.

Anyway,   if anyone has any suggestions or tips on what goes where,   
please post it here.
Inquiring minds want to know,  and I'm not the only one who wants to 
know.

John
