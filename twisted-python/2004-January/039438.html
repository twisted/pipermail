I did.  The basic idea seemed fine, except for the trivial flaws I pointed
out.  I don't have time to test and debug your code for you, though,
especially when it's obvious you haven't tried to do so either.  If your
code isn't working, then it would help us if you could specify *how* it
isn't working, i.e. what error or misbehaviour you are seeing.  Your
previous mail didn't indicate that you'd tested the example code you sent
(and the trivial syntax errors suggest this is also the case).

&gt;<i> &gt;Also, good style suggests that you probably shouldn't mix your

What I was trying to say is rather than subclass like this:

    IRCClient (from twisted.protocols.irc)
     |
     \--YourIRCApp (adds WHO command, has your application logic)

It might be a better idea to do it like this:

    IRCClient (from twisted.protocols.irc)
     |
     \--ExtendedIRCClient (adds WHO command)
         |
         \--YourIRCApp (has your application logic)

But that's really just a cosmetic issue.  In an ideal world, Twisted would
already have the WHO command implemented in its standard IRCClient.  Until
we reach that point, though, I still like the idea of keeping the protocol
implementation and the application using that protocol seperate, even if the
&quot;protocol implementation&quot; part of that picture is currently split between
what Twisted already provides (IRCClient) and what you need to add (what I
called ExtendedIRCClient above).

Or you could not implement WHO yourself at all, and use the more complete
IRC implementation in irc2.py...
