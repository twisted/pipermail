Don't worry about the code....   it was put up there to only show to
general construct,  and how I plan to put things together.   it was a 
simple
lame example totally different then what my intended APP was going to
be,   I just used that just to illustrate to others,  my understanding, 
  or
lack thereof..
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Also, good style suggests that you probably shouldn't mix your
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> application
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> code with your IRCClient extensions, i.e. subclass IRCClient for WHO
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> support
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (and other other unimplemented commands you need), and then subclass
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for your application.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't quite understand.   Because in my case,  my application just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intantiates a client long enough to extract some information from the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IRC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server,  issue a &quot;who&quot; command and extract the data.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I always thought it was appropriate to sub-class the part i want to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parts that are not implemented by the parent,  as in my case of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wanting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do the &quot;who&quot; command,  so I treated the command like any other IRC 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> command
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that issues commands and gets back data.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So If I can't mix my application code with a sub_class of a IRCClient,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then how is the right way to do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I was trying to say is rather than subclass like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     IRCClient (from twisted.protocols.irc)
</I>&gt;<i>      |
</I>&gt;<i>      \--YourIRCApp (adds WHO command, has your application logic)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might be a better idea to do it like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     IRCClient (from twisted.protocols.irc)
</I>&gt;<i>      |
</I>&gt;<i>      \--ExtendedIRCClient (adds WHO command)
</I>&gt;<i>          |
</I>&gt;<i>          \--YourIRCApp (has your application logic)
</I>
I've already decided that....    because when I first started to use
Twisted,  I had no clue of even the existance of ExtendedIRCClient
because it was so cleverly mis-labeled and hidden so well in the
examples,  I never would have found it,  had I not posted this in
the first place.
