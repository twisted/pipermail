That's what I thought.   Did you take a look at that code sample I sent 
earlier?
I hacked that up myself,  with few examples,  so I can see where i 
might have
put things in places they weren't intended to be.

I want to really learn Twisted,  and to be able to put pieces together 
without
having to be constantly digging for example code,  and twiddling with 
that.

I don't quite understand.   Because in my case,  my application just 
intantiates
a client long enough to extract some information from the IRC server,  
issue
a &quot;who&quot; command and extract the data.

I always thought it was appropriate to sub-class the part i want to do, 
  or
parts that are not implemented by the parent,  as in my case of wanting
to do the &quot;who&quot; command,  so I treated the command like any other
IRC command that issues commands and gets back data.

So If I can't mix my application code with a sub_class of a IRCClient,  
then
how is the right way to do it.
