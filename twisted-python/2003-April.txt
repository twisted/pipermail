Subject: [Twisted-Python] supressess warnings
Message-ID: <96CF4C0E-6439-11D7-8A58-000393C92466@dalkescientific.com>

I'm just starting to learn how to use Twisted.  My first project
is to write a simple XML-RPC server.  I started with the demo,
and that worked fine.

I then added an import statement for the module I need.

from openeye.oechem import *

Now, this uses a shared library extension which was built
for Python 2.2, and I'm running a CVS version of Python 2.3,
so I usually get

/usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages/openeye/oechem.py:5:  
RuntimeWarning: Python C API version mismatch for module _oechem: This  
Python has API version 1012, module _oechem has version 1011.
   import _oechem

However, that didn't happen when I started my my simple
server.  I got no warning message.  I started to worry that my
file system wasn't properly saving files!  I played around with
the imports, and moved that import to be above the twisted
ones, and it started reporting the warning.

A bit of searching later and I found
   twisted/python/log.py
which redefines (!) warnings.showwarning to dump the data to a
logfile, which is initialized to a NullFile(), which does nothing.

So the twisted code is throwing some (potentially useful) diagnostics.

Doing a search I found the commit statement
http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-commits/2002-October/ 
003975.html
 > 2) implemented a custom warning handler; now warnings look sexy.
 >   (the hackish overriding of warnings.showwarning is the recommended  
way to
 >   do so, according to the library reference.)

I'll grant that's what the docs say.  However, why is the logfile for
showwarnings initialized to NullFile, and not to sys.stderr?

For that matter, I think it's better to delay replacement until  
startLogging
is called.

Hmm, and why is os.linesep used in the logging?  The log
file should have been opened in text mode, in which case "\n"
will get translated to the proper os-dependent form.


I started to change the code, so I could submit a patch.  I got the
code out of CVS and am reading the documentation at
   http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/coding-standard
It says that the main test suite builder is in 'twisted.test.test_all'

That module doesn't exist (can't import it) nor is the appropriate
file present anywhere.  And the hyperlink from that page yields
   "No Such Resource
    File not found."

It then says
   Acceptance tests are all automated by the bin/accepttests
but that program is in admin/accepttests

I ran that for my Mac OS X machine, with 'open' as the
WEBBROWSER setting (where does the '-b' option go, since
open doesn't block .. do I pass it to 'accepttests'?  Yes.) and  
/bin/true
as my IRCCLIENT, since I wouldn't know what to do with one
even assuming I had one.

Anyway, after a while it gave this error

Could not import twisted.test.test_conch: No module named Crypto.Cipher





So I tried to rewrite the code given that it looks like the self-tests
run reasonably well, but then ran into complications with this bit of  
code

# Make sure we have some basic logging setup.  This only works in  
cpython.
try:
     logOwner
except NameError:
     logOwner = LogOwner()

     ...

# Prevent logfile from being erased on reload.  This only works in  
cpython.
try:
     logfile
except NameError:
     logfile = NullFile()
     logerr = sys.stderr


Okay, so we've got some code duplication here, and comment
skew.  I've fixed that up, and tidied up a few other bits of the code.
And for the life of me I can't figure out why the log file should
default (when no logging is enabled) to the NullFile rather than
sys.stderr -- if you really want the NullFile, just pass it in.  So
I switched it to use sys.stderr.

I then reran the 'admin/runtests' script and got ... some warnings
and comments which were being supressed.

Also, I removed those os.linesep references, and the os module,
and the needless string module.  And turned 'file_protocol' into
'_file_protocol' since it's for internal use only.

Why's the Log pickleable? What happens if a cStringIO is passed
in instead of a file?  Or an outgoing network socket?  Or a
os.popen("lp")?

It looks like Log.synchronized is old code that can be removed.  Yes?

Why does doc/examples/cursesclient.py set log.logfile directly?
Shouldn't it call log.startLogging(log.NullFile()) ?  It's the only  
other
piece of code which references log.NullFile.

Is 'discardLogs' the true inverse of startLogging?  If so, it
should add something to restore sys.stdout/sys.stderr if
startLogging asked them to be changed.

If not, where's the 'stopLogging' function?  And 'discard'
means to ignore logging?  Or should it throw away the
log files?  The terminology is confusing.

Anyway, the diff -u is attached for you all to review and
correct.

the latter shouldn't be present?

Do you mean PB+SSL?

If so, the support for it (pb.connectSSL, or whatever the function is
called) is broken, IIRC. Sorry. I might have a reason to fix it soon,
however.

If you *do* mean PB+SSH, I have no idea what you mean.

Fixed in CVS - warnings will be logged to stderr if no log file was
specified.

Running admintests correctly is hard - I've never gotten the web distrib
tests to pass. In general these tests are more for the release manager
than for end users.

Probably not.

Basically, Twisted logging starts out with all log.msg() messages being
discarded, and exceptions, errors and in CVS warnings, logged to stderr.
startLogging() will set it so all messages get logged to the specified
file-like object.

Yeah, replacing showwarnings is the idiomatic way to override the
display of warnings. The bit that initializes the default logfile to
NullFile is something moshez and glyph wanted, and, for the record,
something I'm against. (sorry glyph :-)

Oh, that's a bit out of date. Just run `./bin/trial -p twisted.test'
if you want to run all of the Twisted tests. I'll update the doc.

Note that all developers aren't really expected to run these, it's
super-dependant on your environment and is finicky about how exactly
you start the script. I'll add this to the doc, as well.

Oh, it seems itamar just fixed those issues with the coding standard.

Yeah, `admin/runtests' just runs `bin/trial -p twisted.test', for

I have no idea what the rest of the problems were about, though.

I wish this could be accepted, but unless glyph changes his mind, it
probably won't. The usual response is to use twistd, but twistd isn't
appropriate in all use-cases (it is in yours, however). The *reason*,
IIRC, was that "you shouldn't spam unwanted stuff to STDIO", which I
think is stupid. Application developers could notice spam to stdio,
and, if they don't like it, startLogging to NullFile. (I've heard a
lot more complaints about "Why don't I see any output!?" than "Why
does Twisted write stuff to my stdio?")

</rant>

Sorry, I guess I'll stop beating a dead horse. :)

Well, it should probably be pickleable only when it _can_ be. :) i.e.,
__getstate__ could test for a `.name' attribute on the file object, or
something. Handling stuff like StringIO might be a bit trickier
without hardcoding an `isinstance(self.file, StringIO)' into
it... Perhaps it could `try: cPickle.dumps(self.file)' to test if the
file's pickleable in the case where it's not a named file ;-)

No, I'm pretty sure this is so threaded code that writes to the log
doesn't break.

Well, if you want to switch your logging to something else
(sys.stdout/stderr), then pass that something else to startLogging,
probably.

Well, no, usually people use twistd. Which you should, if you're
writing a server. It handles logging, daemonization, and a whole slew
of other things for you, and, contrary to what most people think,
doesn't require the use of .taps (see the `-y' parameter).


Anyway, thanks for the in-depth message, it was helpful.

Ok, so apparently I had forgotten that glyph *did* agree to log errors
and warnings to STDIO, but when he implemented the change it didn't
work. Sorry, glyph :) Itamar just checked in a fix so stuff gets
logged to stderr. Hooray!

The reason that moshez and I have it written this way is simple: we 
don't want library code generating spurious messages that your code may 
not want printed.  However, I think that you're correct in criticizing 
it for throwing away warnings and tracebacks.  Errors, even in library 
code, ought to be presented the same way they're normally presented.

As long as we're talking about sys.std*err*, and not std*out*, I think 
this is acceptable.  I'd like to hear if moshez's has any objections 
too, but barring that, let's do it immediately.

This should be a FAQ.

	Q.  Is using 'twistd' always appropriate?

	A.  Not always, but it is in your case.

Oh, I heard a lot of complaints about it writing spurious messages to 
stdio before this change was made.  Different people are unhappy, but 
people are unhappy either way :-)

Itamar Shtull-Trauring:

Mmm, okay, I see the patch you did in CVS.

One thing I don't like about the log system is that it goes
into place on import, rather than after some explicit request
to actually use the log.  It isn't obvious anywhere that that
import will make a system level change.
   - what if I've changed warnings.showwarning in my own
        code (or in some other 3rd party package).  Where's the
        documentation which states that there will be a problem?

   - It's pervasive.  That is, if I import twisted.lore (perhaps
       because I want it to use it for my own documentation
       system) it's still the case that warnings.showwarning
       gets replaced.  There should be no reason for that.

Are there any other system-level functions or settings which
get tweaked by Twisted?

 > > It looks like Log.synchronized is old code that can be removed.   
Yes?

 > Probably not

Ahh, I see.  It's emulating the Java keyword.  Hmm, I probably
would have had a Log implementation which changed depending
on of this was threaded or not, and have threaded calls forward
the write/writeline via a Queue.

There are only 4 places which use that, outside of some of the
test code.  Is it really that useful given how non-obvious it is?

Also, I see that the other places which use a class with the
synchronized attribute (like web/static.py) also call  
threadable.synchronize
on the class, as in

python/logfile.py:threadable.synchronize(LogFile)
test/test_threadpool.py:threadable.synchronize(Counter)
test/test_threads.py:threadable.synchronize(Counter)
web/static.py:threadable.synchronize(FileTransfer)

Notice that log.py's Log class, which has a 'synchronized'
attribute, is not so initialized.  This suggests there's either a bug
(this class needs to be synchronized) or that that attribute is
unneeded.

Christopher Armstrong:
 > The bit that initializes the default logfile to NullFile is
 > something moshez and glyph wanted

Actually, I don't care where the default logfile goes, I just
care where my system warnings go.  But as you pointed out
in a later email, it's now sent to 'STDIO'.

I still don't like that it goes into effect without me doing
anything other than an import.

 > I have no idea what this error means.

Looking only at the error message, it means that:
   - the option parsing code does automatic prefix expansion, so
        that if the option is '--pop3' and the argument is '--pop' and no
        other option starts with '--pop' then it's elided to '--pop3'.   
This
        was what DEC machines did for VMS commands (as I recall)
        and it was annoying because if a new option is added (like
        '--popcorn') then scripts which assumed that '--pop' would
        always be unique, broke.

   - and a new option was added which started with the '--pop'
        prefix, breaking the code.

   - and no one has run those tests in a while, probably not since
      10-Feb-03 when moshez added the following option.

        ["pop3s", "S", 0, "Port to start the POP3-over-SSL server on (0  
to disable)."],

Again, I realize this has been changed.  Just wanted to note
that system warnings about API differences are wanted, as well
as warnings about deprecations, etc.

That didn't answer my question of why it needs to be pickled.
I suppose it's part of the App, which saves complete state via
a pickle?  Err, it can't, because that's a module variable.

In any case, the cleaner way to fix it is to have a specialized
replacement called instead of the native open call, and
have it store the arguments so that the unpickling gets the
correct calls, and allow backwards compatibility with
   if isinstance(logfile, file):
     logfile = PickleableFile(logfile)

 > Well, no, usually people use twistd. Which you should, if you're
 > writing a server.

I'm just working my way through the example, and it doesn't
use twistd, so I didn't.

As mentioned, I don't like how system settings are changed
on an import, much less without documentation which says
this will happen.

If everything server related should be done in the context
of twistd, then that warnings.showwarning replacement
should only be done when twistd is used, which is why
the patch I sent only made the switch when startLogging
was called.

The solution I see now, which is that showwarnings calls
the errlog instead of the msg log, still isn't the right
behaviour, IMO, if only because you are changing the
format of the error messages.  At the very least you should
call warnings.formatwarning instead of building your own
warning message.

Oh, and the code should be that if file is not None, to
use the file handle passed in to showwarnings, and not
the error log, that is, replace twisted/python/log.py from

def showwarning(message, category, filename, lineno, file=None):
     err('''\
WARNING: %s::
%s
file: %s; line: %s
''' % (category, indent(message), filename, lineno))

to

def showwarning(message, category, filename, lineno, file=None):
     m = warnings.formatwarning(message, category, filename, lineno)
     if file is None:
       err(m)
     else:
       file.write(m)

Finally, I noticed that other part of my patch were not accepted.
For example, the use of os.linesep is incorrect.  The log file is
opened in text mode, so "\n" will be converted to the appropriate
byte representation for the given platform.  In other words,

         logerr.write(str(stuff)+os.linesep)
should be
         logerr.write(str(stuff)+"\n")

I also did some things to clean up the code, like getting
rid of unneeded module imports (like string) and replacing

import cStringIO
  ...
StringIO = cStringIO
del cStringIO

with

import cStringIO as StringIO

I noticed none of these were accepted.

What should I do to make these sorts of changes more acceptable?
After all, the point of a good unit test suite is to make it easy for
people to refactor and clean up existing code.  All the tests passed
identically before and after my changes.

I could, for instance, have split up the patch into several parts.
However, part of what I did was to replace the warnings.showwarning
code only once, which required a test against a reload (as is
done in two other parts for the code) so I moved those into a
single change and fixed the comments for why it was done.

I agree that this is bad. If you complain enough maybe glyph will listen

Yes, they only get run during releases. Jean-Paul fixed the --pop issue
in CVS I think.

Some of the failed tests look like timing issues, yes.

Gar. I wonder why this isn't showing on the Max OS X buildbot.

Typo - fixed in CVS.

Any bugs we can reproduce and are easily fixable will be fixed by next
release, e.g. the dom one.

We should have logging docs soon.

The idea was to have more informative messages. Can you put in something
comparing the two formats?

Done, at least partially.

Not really, I just didn't get around to reading the patch. I did some of
these in CVS.

They were not bad, it seems, we just don't have time to deal with all of
them... I have a huge queue waiting for me :(

We do appreciate your efforts.

Yes, but behaviour was changed I think? Possibly in a better way, but

Message-ID: <5ECE2030-64BE-11D7-8315-000A95686CD8@redivi.com>

I think it's useful to have a callAt function in the reactor.  Itamar 
mentioned that one of the design goals of the reactor is to have a 
minimal interface.  However, IMHO it should be added to IReactor due to 
the utility (log rotation, scheduled events, etc.) of such a 
convenience function and the fact it takes a newbie a lot longer to 
find something hidden away in a utils package (for example, today, 
neither Itamar nor I knew that there was a function in t.i.utils to 
start a process and return a Deferred with the stdout of that 
process!).  The implementation is very simple, it looks like this:

     def callAt(self, when, f, *args, **kw):
         """See twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorTime.callAt.
         """
         return self.callLater(max(0.0, when - time()), f, *args, **kw)

     def callAt(self, when, callable, *args, **kw):
         """Call a function at a specified float time

         @type when:  C{float}
         @param when: The approximate unix time (seconds since the 
Epoch) to
                      call the callable.  It will be called on or after 
the specified time;
                      immediately if the current or a past time is given.

         @param callable: the callable object to call later.

         @param args: the arguments to call it with.

         @param kw: they keyword arguments to call it with.

         @returns: An L{IDelayedCall} object that can be used to cancel
                   the scheduled call, by calling its C{cancel()} method.
                   It also may be rescheduled by calling its C{delay()}
                   or C{reset()} methods.

everyone has voiced their requirements.

Well, I was the one who made this change, and there's no particular

mm.. because twisted already has an ftp server? see module

	twisted.coil.plugins.ftp

(just guessing from the API, never used coil myself.)

Yes, there is an ftp server.

In API docs:

....
Package twisted :: Package protocols :: Module ftp :: Class FTP

An FTP server.
....

...
twisted.tap.ftp

I am the support module for making a ftp server with mktap.
....

....
twisted.coil.plugins.ftp

Coil plugin for FTP server.
...


but I can't find any examples, or how-to, or implementation reference.

twisted.protocols.ftp has code for a FTP server that serves files from
the filesystem. It's not pluggable, and needs a lot of work, but it
could be used as a basis for a cleaned up refactored server.

Or, you could skip FTP (it's a really sucky protocol) and build a WebDAV
server instead.

Usage and behaviour of a PullProducer isn't clear to me.  Does
PullProducer.resumeProducing mean that it should call consumer.write
exactly once?  Or is the amount of times consumer.write will be called
undefined or context-dependent but merely guaranteed to be finite?

A PushProducer delivers an undefined quantity of data to consumer.write
some unknown time after resumeProducing is called.  A PullProducer
delivers an undefined quantity of data to consumer.write some unknown
time after resumeProducing is called.  So why two interfaces?  Why don't
pulling consumers just use pauseProducing upon getting a .write?[1] 
Then we can ditch one of the interfaces and the 'streaming' argument to
registerProducer and the conditionals that go with it...

If it is a different interface, can we give the method a different
name?  I think it strange that you call "resume" on these when producing
has never been "paused".  And that "resume" in this case does not signal
a return to an ongoing process from which it has been interrupted, but
is a single  request for a discrete amount of data.  A name beginning
with "get" or "next" seems more fitting.

 - Kevin


[1] "...just use pauseProducing upon getting a write()?": One answer to
that could be "it's more message traffic"; every write in a
pull-producer implemented on PushProducer this way would involve
p.resume();c.write();p.pause() as opposed to just p.resume();c.write(). 
But that alone doesn't convince me the interface confusion is worth it.

Yes, but it's there for historical reasons...

Idon't think the two interfaces should be merged - they are different in

This is also similar to the 'flow' module by Bob Ippolito (etrepum)
and somewhat distantly related to my flow module; only that mine is
more 'push' like.  Both are attempts at bringing an async 
producer into play, where the producer could at any time block.

Message-ID: <E190cRJ-0003PJ-00@pyramid.twistedmatrix.com>

It is often convenient in protocol implementations to just .read() as
much as you want to. However, it is impossible in Twisted, becase .read()
is a blocking operation. Happily, we can make blocking operations seem
non-blocking with the use of deferred. The following protocol does just
that:

class ReadProtocol(protocol.Protocol)

    toRead = 0
    until = ''

    def rawDataReceived(self, data):
        pass

    def dataReceived(self, data):
        while data:
            if self.toRead:
                read, data = data[:self.toRead], data[self.toRead:]
                self.buffer.write(read)
                self.toRead -= len(read)
                if self.toRead == 0:
                    self.deferred.callback(self.buffer.getvalue())
                    self.buffer.close()
            elif self.until:
                idx = data.find(self.until)
                if idx == -1:
                    self.buffer.write(data)
                    data = ''
                else:
                    read, data = data[:idx], data[idx:]
                    self.until = ''
                    self.buffer.write(read):
                    self.deferred.callback(self.buffer.getvalue())
                    self.buffer.close()
            else:
                self.rawDataReceived(data)
                data = ''

        self.buffer = StringIO()
        self.deferred = defer.Deferred()
        return self.deferred

# How to use, e.g., to implement netstrings:

class NetstringProtocol(ReadProtocol):

    def connectionMade(self):
        self.readString()

    def readString(self):
        self.readUntil(':').callback(
        lambda s: self.readLength(int(s)).callback(
        self.stringReceived).callback(
        lambda _: self.readLength(1).callback(
        lambda x: x==',' or self.transport.loseConnection()).callback(
        lambda _: self.readString))

Shouldn't this just be in startLogging?

I'm pretty sure startLogging is called at some point on import? Or how
is the default logging set up?

Just to bring generators back up..  Note that of course, the wrappers 
for read and the actual flow.BufferedProtocol class don't exist.. but 
their implementation is possible with the given syntax.
I'm imagining that a "flow" version of Int32Receiver could be coded 
like this:

class NetstringProtocol(flow.BufferedProtocol):
	def connectionMade(self):
		pass

	def handleConnection(self):
		self.connectionMade()
		reason = None

		# the string receive loop
		while 1:
			# read int32, size of int32 is 4
			result = self.read(4)
			yield result
			if result.isFailure():
				reason = result.get()
				break
			strlen, = struct.unpack('!I', result.get())
			if strlen <= 0:
				endFailure = Failure(ValueError('Zero length strings are not 
valid'))
				break
			# read string
			result = self.read(strlen)
			yield result
			if result.isFailure():
				reason = result.get()
				break
			self.stringReceived(result.get())

		# exception caused connection to drop, or connection dropped on its 
own
		self.connectionLost(reason)

	def connectionLost(self, reason):
		pass

The twiddling of warnings is done during import, and the
logfile is set to NullFile.  The code looks like this (including
the indentation level)

import warnings
warnings.showwarning = showwarning
   ....
# Prevent logfile from being erased on reload.  This only works in 
cpython.
try:
     logfile
except NameError:
     logfile = NullFile()
     logerr = sys.stderr


The patch I submitted changes matters so that twiddling
doesn't occur until startLogging is called.

We are probably not going to use it - those of us who looked at it

I'm new to Twisted, so please forgive me if this is obvious.  I read the
howtos and looked at some of the example programs, but didn't find anything
relevant.

I would like to use a protocol with SOCKS.  For example, ircLogBot.py calls
reactor.connectTCP().  How would I make it connect through SOCKS?  If
Twisted does not currently have this functionality, how would I go about
implemented it the correct way?

I notice from expirmentation that reactor.stop() seems to sever any ongoing
network connections.  Is there a way to temporarily stop then restart the
reactor without losing a network connection?  Or would I need to write my
own reactor?

I'm writing unit tests, where I want to script a sequence of events.
Currently I have a (pyui) loop calling twisted.internet.main.iterate(), and
have my code accept a startup flag telling it whether to stop for procederal
input after remote PB calls.

This is a bit awkward, and so I'm hoping someone has dealt with this before
in twisted.

I notice that there is a "newjelly.py" in twisted.spread, which appears to
have changed the code relavent to the error I was getting.  However, I
couldn't easily tell from the commit email whether this was finished, or how
one would use it...

Am I correct in guessing newjelly.py is intended to be renamed to jelly.py,
but isn't ready yet?

PS  I've got a kludge to the 1.03 jelly.py and flavors.py that avoids the
"storing a _Derefence into a __dict__" error I was getting.  If anyone's
interested I can post it, although there would be little point if newjelly.py
will be ready soon.

Yes, I have tested it also, and needed the activeState solution. Some

the "dirty" solution solve the problem

Yes, It's similar to the flow module. I 've seen the source in sandbox on 
cvs, flow will be very usefull in network processes (like treatments on 
database results). Please finish it !

The way you use it is by replacing the imports at the top of pb.py and 
flavors.py to say "import jelly as newjelly" or "from newjelly import 
...".  Please do this and see if your problem is solved.  (better yet, 
contribute a unit test so we can make sure future changes don't break 
this either...)

The real issue is that this is a protocol-breaking change, and we're 
not quite prepared to deal with the fallout from that.  Brian Warner 
and I hacked on this at PyCon, and he has some ideas for backwards 
compatible version negotiation, so we may want to keep the old 
implementation around anyway.  When we figure out if and how we're 
going to do backwards compatibility, we'll make the changeover.

Also, the idea behind this implementation was to simplify things so 
that some new kinds of optimizations are possible -- the implementation 
is still really grotty (though it should be functional; I've made the 
aforementioned change to my pb.py and flavors.py and the PB unit tests 
pass), and I want to make sure that these optimizations *are* actually 
made possible, and we haven't just shuffled things around for no reason 
:-)

I just took the shortcut of replacing jelly.py with newjelly.py, as I didn't
want to hunt down imports to change.  I got several errors, and hence
wondered if it was finished, e.g.

I get this Traceback when sending from Perspective -> Client
...
  File "...jelly.py", line 536, in _unjelly_tuple
    if preTuple.resolvedObject is None:
exceptions.AttributeError: _Tuple instance has no attribute 'resolvedObject'

After this error I get a similar error (when sending from Client ->
Perspective) where a local variable that is set on my Perspective before
calling a "remote" client method is later missing when the client calls a
"perspective" method.

I haven't looks more closely than this though.


I posted a test case demonstrating the "circular ref" bug a couple of
messages up this thread, but didn't work out a unit test.  I'll try to get
some time to do that, although I understand twisted uses something other than
pyunit so I'm not sure what's involved.

A cursory glance at newjelly.py makes me think it can't possibly have the
same problem, as "references" and "derefences" now seem to be treated in the
same manner, and presumably your unit tests cover simple references. ;-)

For what it's worth (after a cursory glance), the reference/dereference

understandability and correctness. :-)

1. Never ever use twisted.internet.main. Please. It is waaaay
deprecated.

2. You can use reactor.iterate().

3. For unittesting, reactor.crash() does exactly what you want - stop
reactor without closing anything.

I really enjoyed your talks at PyCon last week, as did pretty much everyone
I spoke with.  You all did a great job at creating a lot of enthusiasm for
twisted.

So I come home, and get the 1.0.3 self-installer for windows, as well as the
docs and start playing.

First thing I notice is that the introductory demo doesn't work, because
twistd.py won't run as a script (it has no "if __name__ == '__main__':
run()").  I obviously could fix that, but it seems so basic that I worry
that I'm just missing something (like I'm not supposed to be using the
scripts in /scripts directly).

Next question is what happened to support for a FieldStorage-like api in the
protocols.http.request module?  Googling shows that 0.99.3 had it, but 1.03
doesn't.  Is it coming back, or to be replaced by something else?  I'd like
it for file uploads in a very simple web-based photo album, to share some
family shots.

Thanks in advance for the help, and again, great job at PyCon.

In my unit tests I often do the following.

Just before the reactor starts.

You're not supposed to be using the scripts in site-packages/*/scripts
directly.  I'm told the Windows installer puts the runnable scripts in
something like C:\Python22\scripts\twistd.py

Happy twisting,

It was in, but had to be taken out since it broke other code. Eventually
it will return - meanwhile you can still access the same data, just less
efficiently using existing APIs.

The files in twisted/scripts are not the ones you want to run... you need
to run the ones that were installed under c:\python22\scripts, or wherever
they go on your own machine.  Those basically do an imported from the 
twisted.scripts.xxx modules and call xxx.run(), so it amounts to almost
the same thing.

FieldStorage, as in the cgi module?  What don't you like about the request.args
field that is nicely parsed for you from the HTTP GET or POST request?  (Note
that the fields all come in as lists, so if you expect only one instance of
any given field you need to grab request.args['fieldname'][0] to get the
actual string value.)

I'm a rookie at Twisted, but I've just "been there" on both issues... good
fodder for a tutorial/FAQ I suppose... or a wiki.

reactor.crash is better for tests since you can call reactor.run again
afterwards.

  We use twisted.trial, which presents an interface that's almost identical
to pyunit, so if you're familiar with one, working with the other should be
fairly easy.

  That said, I've added a TestCase to test_jelly.py that seems to tickle
this bug. :)  It's simplified even more from your example, but I think it
still catches the essense of the problem.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] What's twistd doing on Windows?
Message-ID: <3E8CB2A2.5010908@norfolkgraphics.com>

Hi all,

First of all I wanted to say thanks to all the Twisted guys that gave 
talks at PyCon 2003.  I was going to use Zope for an upcoming project, 
but the demos you all gave made me think that Twisted might be a better 
fit for what we're doing.  So I had to have a look once I got home. :)

So far it's looking good; getting Twisted installed and a web instance 
running was a snap on both Windows and Debian.  I had zero knowledge of 
Twisted prior to PyCon, but I was able to start from scratch on Saturday 
and put together a simple web interface to some of our existing Python 
apps by Sunday afternoon.

I did notice something that I'm curious about: I've been running two 
Twisted web instances, one on a Win2k machine (1.4GHz P4, Python 2.2.2) 
and one on a Debian machine (266MHz PII, Python 2.1.3) for a few days 
now, and the Windows instance has accumulated almost an hour of CPU time 
wherease the Debian instance has only used 2 seconds.  What's the Win32 
instance doing while it's idle? (It's not a big deal, I'm just curious)

Thanks!
Alan McIntyre

My first guess would be that the system calls involved (e.g., select)
are more expensive than on linux, but that's just a wild guess. I
doubt profiling would be much help, but maybe you (or someone) could
write a simple test that just recorded the time it takes to run an
immediately-returning select() a few thousand times.

If this doesn't show any useful information, I also realized that
Twisted has some code to handle Windows' wacky select() semantics;
maybe there's something munching a little bit of CPU in those special
cases.

IIRC, the Twisted select reactor has a "background process" that gets 
triggered once a second or so when running on windows just to break the 
select() call (I don't believe it actually does anything).  I believe 
this is because processes in windows don't respond to signals (like 
ctrl-c, for example) during a select() call, so this 
convenience/workaround was put into the codebase.

In any case, an hour of CPU time over a few days is pretty negligible, 
but worthy of note for comparison's sake I suppose.. On a more heavily 
used Twisted daemon, it really wouldn't make any difference, since the 
select() call would spend less time idling.

A simple test shows that select() on 100 sockets, 
1000 times takes 1.313s (Windows XP, P4, 1.5GHz).  
Iterating on just one socket (which I think is 
what happens when idling) takes about 3/100 of a 
second.  To get an hour of CPU time, this would 
take 115 million select()s.  Whether or not that 
many select()s actually happen is up to other 
people. :)

how do you use it with adbapi ?? I mean, how do you use callbacks with your
flow ?

How does it work if a bloc has several inputs ?
I want to do this :

DS1 ---> FS1 ---+
                +--->  FS3
DS2 ---> FS2 ------->  FS3

Two datasources provide some data. Data are used to run Fuzzy Inference 
Systems (FS1, FS2, FS3).

FS3 must wait until all its inputs are ready. Is it possible with flow.py ?
Will it be possible ?

Ah. Judging from your unit tests, It looks you can just import
twisted.trial.unittest as unittest, and existing pyunit tests should just
work.  D'oh!

Thanks!  It was probably a good idea to remove all of the pb baggage from
my test case. ;-)

Yah, I saw a note to that effect in main, but I was following an

Ah, I see it now.  The name threw me off, as "crash" doesn't exactly

Just one more thing to say about this:  the installer for Twisted on
Windows provides icons in the start menu for a few things, one of which is
"Twisted Command Prompt".  This prompt runs a very thin batch file which
makes all the commands run on Windows "just like unix"; that is, typing

c:\>mktap

will do what you expect.

This even works sometimes. :-)  

I'd report a bug, but it happened while I was still in the pre-newbie
stage with Twisted, and we have an unusual Python installation (network-
based) so I wasn't ready to blame the Twisted installer.  As I recall,
it was something like win32com.shortcut that was missing, and it was
needed by something that was like "win32_postinstall.py" (I really 
don't remember the name, and can't find the file right now).

The symptom, other than a failure right at the end of the installation
process (after the .pyc files are generated), was the lack of a Windows
start menu entry and any shortcuts...

If there's a concern about this, I can keep my eye out for what it was.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] release momentum
Message-ID: <1049480936.10270.52.camel@troglodyte.funhouse>

Our release schedule, or lack thereof, is getting to me.  I'm reluctant
to deploy new releases of CVSToys because I'd be asking people to depend
on an "alpha" version of Twisted.  At least one person has come in to
#twisted asking if there was going to be a release soon, or if he had to
ask his users to get Twisted from CVS.  

Our last *alpha* release was was five weeks before PyCon started; there
have been over five hundred commits since that time.

I know we've all been busy, I know our release manager has had to devote
his attention to people who will help him pay his bills -- I'm not
concerned with any of that now.  All I want to know is what we have to
do to get another alpha release out.

Tests we're having problems with:

 * testSignal in test_process.PosixProcessTestCase, fails regularly
under buildbot for python2.2, but not 2.1.  I cannot reproduce this
failure.

 * testStor in test_ftp, intermittent failures.

 * ThrottlingTestCase in test_policies has intermittent failures, they
may be spurious timing issues.

 * test_imap is under heavy development, failures changed fresh daily.

 * test_jelly.CircularReferenceTestCase, Jasper's bug.

How many of these do we have to turn green before we can build the next
alpha release?  Is the jelly bug going to wait on newjelly?

Since I'm the one raising a stink, I'll volunteer to manage the next
release should Chris remain unavailable.

(Now why did saying that start the music of foreshadowing doom in my
head?)

Thanks everyone for the quick response.

The command prompt is VERY helpful, given the sorry state of Windows command
line life (and \python22\scripts is not added to PATH by the windows python
installer, so I didn't think to look there).  Sorry I didn't see the
question previously posted.

As for Peter's question about the need for a CGI.FieldStorage type api, it's
really only an issue when you're doing huge multipart mime posts (e.g., file
uploads).  The idea of passing around those results (potentially multi
megabyte) as strings is kind of frightening.  That said, I have no grasp on
what issues are raised when handling these things asynchronously (the cgi
module is all synchronous).

Thanks again.

What is it about passing around multi-megabyte data as strings that scares
you?  The data is only needed temporarily, I would think, until it is written
to a file.  Servers have gobs of memory, and massive file uploads are 
rare... or if they're not, surely the server can have adequate capacity
to handle the load (memory-wise).

Maybe I'm too naive, but unless I was expecting, say, greater than 10MB
or 20MB files on a regular basis, I wouldn't think twice about just using
strings.  Much simpler than trying to juggle temporary files and references
to them and removing them when appropriate etc.

Is your concern a case of premature optimization?

This is indeed an issue and the reason FieldStorage support will return
at some point.

It's not premature optimization, it's proper design for an async 
framework.  If for no other reason, large strings take non-trivial 
amounts of time to process.  For example, on my laptop (which has a gig 
of ram): ('a' * 2**20).replace('a', 'b') takes about 0.35 seconds.. 
Twisted is not threaded, so that's a bad thing to do.  Processing 
chunks with file-like interfaces is scalable, large strings are 
definitely not.

  Thanks for bringing this up.  I've been wondering about it a bit myself as
well.

  I wouldn't be unhappy if imap4 were left out of the next release, if that
release is done before 1) the protocol support is somewhat stable 2) there
is a mailbox implementation in Twisted proper (I currently have one, but not
in Twisted).

  Of course, I also wouldn't be unhappy if it were included, assuming it is
in reasonable condition when someone actually does go ahead with the
release.

  Speaking of newjelly... Is it definite yet whether this will be backwards
compatible with the current jelly yet?  I assumed it would not be, but I've
heard some rumors...

  Since our numbering scheme is currently "* glyph rolls dice.", maybe this
doesn't matter, but I think it *might* be nice if the next release was
1.1.0, if jelly compatibility isn't going to be maintained.

You definitely have a point there.

Zow.  I hadn't counted.  This is pretty bad.

Neither can I.  does anyone have a theory as to what's causing it?

This should be fixed eventually, but it's been having problems forever. 
  We shouldn't hold up the release based on it.

The tests are written incorrectly.  They assert things that should 
usually be true, but aren't necessarily.

JP should get these to pass, but similarly they should not hold up the 
release.

I'll pick this one up, since it's really my fault.  I should be able to 
look at it on Sunday.

> How many of these do we have to turn green before we can build the

The jelly bug shouldn't wait on newjelly because this involves breaking 
compatibility not only with old Twisted, but also with every other 
language implementation of PB that currently exists.  These should 
eventually be fixed, but I think at this point that we just can't 
ignore compatibility in the meanwhile.

Let me give you some advice, from the last time I volunteered to do 
this.  Corner Chris on IRC, get him to explain everything that needs to 
be done, and then take it over.  Don't wait for him to agree that he 
won't be available :-).

It's actually not that much work, now that most of it's automated.  The 
only thing that's really time-consuming is having to re-do it all every 
time somebody checks in a fix, and twice when moving to final-RC to 
final-release.

I think we should stick with 1.0.4, since I think we should do the 
release ASAP, and not wait until we have enough time to test newjelly 
with all the applications that might need it.

And everyone can help by making sure they add changelog entries for any
new features/APIs they added since 1.0.3.

non-incremental, I would just set this up as a 
chain of Deferreds and not bother with flow as
it might be overkill for your needs.

In other words, in the twisted.enterprise.adbapi
when you run a query, it returns a deferred.  So
DS1 and DS2 would be those query results.

Your FS1 and FS2 should be deferred operations
as well, but fired via the 'addCallback' on 
DS1 and DS2 respectively.

Then FS3 is a DeferredList taking FS1 and FS2.

...

If you can use generators, for more complicated flows, 
etrepum's (Bob Ippolito's) approach may be better approach
to this, although I'm not sure how it would handle more
'fluid' flow through the process.  I need to understand
what he's doing better.   At first I thought his approach
is very different than mine, but I think (although I'm
not quite yet able to explain) that they are isomorphic;
only that I'm using a temp stack and he's using the 
event queue via a linked-list. 

...

As for the stuff in flow.py, right now it uses a thread
for each database connection.  Eventually for PostgreSQL,
I'd like to move over to a non-threaded driver.  Gerhard
was working on such a thing as I remember.  Also, it may
be renamed since extrepum was using "flow.py" before me.

Anyway, the database connection is done through a 
QueryIterator which basically sends a set of rows
(via fetchmany) on to the next stage.  So, the connection
from DS1 to FS1 and DS2 to FS2 could be done using 
a simple flow for each.  The problem in the flow module 
has to do with merging the two flows.  This can be done 
by using the 'context'.

In short, it would work, but I'm not sure that it's
your best option; and I'm still not quite happy with
flow.py myself (although it is in production).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] enterprise.row
Message-ID: <1049574011.1503.45.camel@qutang.gnubian.org>

I'm attempting to implement a simple database application (again) using
twisted.enterprise.row.  Perhaps my failure to do so successfully in the
past should be a hint that I should give up, but the concept seems
really cool, and I keep getting closer.

I'm running into an issue that no doubt has something to do with my lack
of understanding of t.e.row.  I've been wanting to try it for a while,
and decided to design a simple database with the goal of implementing a
simple application using t.e.row.  In any case, it seems I am angering
row.  My first attempt at using it was to try and create/insert a new
row, and i received the following exception:

<- snip ->
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "Zone.py", line 33, in ?
    reflector.insertRow(newZone).addCallback(onInsert)
  File
"/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/enterprise/sqlreflector.py",
line 308, in insertRow
    sql = self.insertRowSQL(rowObject)
  File
"/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/enterprise/sqlreflector.py",
line 301, in insertRowSQL
    args.append(self.quote_value(rowObject.findAttribute(column), type))
  File "/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/enterprise/row.py",
line 87, in findAttribute
    return getattr(self, attr)
AttributeError: ZONE_SOA instance has no attribute 'ZONE_SOAID'
<- snip ->

"ZONE_SOAID" is the primary key for the "ZONE_SOA" table.  I did not set
the primary key because it is a postgres serial column - that is, it
should automatically increment the pkey each time a new row is
inserted.  If I use setKeyAttr("ZONE_SOAID", 1), the AttributeError
comes up for the next attribute that is not being given a value.

I read the row documentation a little more, and it doesn't appear to
like what I'm trying to do all too much.  I can use python to fill the
object with default values, but the database will do that for me, and
with less work on the part of my application (plus, the KeyFactory class
says it is not thread-safe, I know that my postgres series is).

Is there any way for row to allow me to insert a new row with some empty
values, and simply ignore them (allowing the database to use its'
default)?  If not, any idears on where/how this might need to be done? 
Perhaps this is a good time for me to foray into twisted hacking..

TIA,

-Justin

Subject: [Twisted-Python] twistctl - start/stop/restart revisited
Message-ID: <20030405231416.GA97462@doublegemini.com>

Toward the end of the discussion this past morning, we seemed
to have come to the agreement that start/stop/restart behavior
does not belong in twistd.  So, I've taken my original submit
and rephrased it as 'twistctl' which is a wrapper on twistd
providing those features.   

To get twistctl to work nicely with twistd, a few refactors
in twistd were needed:

  1.  refactor runApp to factor out the signal code into
      'signalApp' so that killApp in twistctl could use it.
      In general, runApp is quite huge and could use 
      a few breakdowns anyway

  2.  refactor the code to get the passphrase (if the
      application is encrypted) and the code which 
      parses options in run() into a 'parseOptions'
      method so that it can be called from twistctl

  Neither of these changes affect behavior, they only
  expose chunks of reusable code for twistctl

This is a first pass of this, and I'd like to do two
things in the repository: (a) commit the twistd.py.diff
changes, and (b) to put twistctl into the sandbox so
that people can play with it over the next month or
so and after we have a better idea of how it should
behave, we can then add it to the scripts directory.

The twistctl script needs help in many areas: 

  1. Moshez objected to the killApp implementation,
     when I get time I'll look at it.  But right now
     it works on my platform just wonderfully.
     The beauty of open source projects is that people
     can hack at it till it works for everyone...

  2. The restartApp and startApp behavior are not 
     exactly clear as to how they should use -shutdown.tap
     and a bit more research and experimenting is
     needed before this should be formalized.  Really,
     I'm still too new to taps to grok this fully.

In particular, Moshez said that he thinks this script
should *call* the twistd script via OS methods and
thus the refactor above is not needed.  I respectfully
disagree with his assertion.   Calling python from python
via python call mechanism is far superior as it allows
for better error handling, is less platform dependent,
and numerous other factors; such as being able to 
send a passphrase between the two modules easily.

Anyway, please comment.  And Glyph, I'd like permission
to commit the twistd.py.diff as specified below.

No, that's not a beauty.
Let me explain: checking something which "works for me, usually, when
my machine is not heavily loaded" is the worst thing that you can do.
Intermittent failures are *worse* than deterministic failures. Do you
seriously want something that you can't rely on?
It's not that hard to have an algorithm which is correct. Find one,
and code it.

Let me explain: the interface to twistd is well defined. It's documented
in the manpage. We are commited to maintaining backwards compatibility with
it. What you're doing with the refactor is forcing parts of the internal
twistd implementation to stay static. This is insane. We should not add
extra interfaces where existing ones will do. If "twistd" is not on your
path, just fix your Twisted installation. I fail to see how catering
for broken installations is in any way a good idea. Also, if you call
twistd via the OS, then on such places where both twistd2.1 and twistd2.2
scripts exist, *your script* only has to be available once, since it can
receive the name of the binary which has to be run. I'm not going to even
start talking about how most of the twistd flexibility is not needed,
since in real daemons which run from init scripts, the tap cannot be
encrypted anyway, since the key would have to be available to the script.

If you write the twistdctl, and it is actually working on more than one
platform, *and* there is a significant advantage in making it directly
Python->Python, then you can start thinking of adding more places where
we have to promise backwards compatibility in order not to break stuff.
Notice that this is an especially sore point for stuff like twistdctl
which is naturally harder to test in unit tests.

I think your diagnosis is correct. The current t.e code does not handle
default values in the database schema, afaik. Given that, and the fact
that the reflector wants to cache rows by primary keys, it can't support
leaving primary keys unset before you create a new row.

What I have done with postgres is to generate the primay key using
the nextval function on the sequence used for the serial column, setting
the row object's primary key, and then inserting it. This makes the t.e
code happy and you often need to know the new key anyway.

It would be nice to make t.e allow for default values and db-generated
primary keys, but that code would almost certainly need to be 
per-database since different databases handle serial/autoincrement
columns differently.

Yes, you convinced me that the implementation sucks.  This is
why I'm proposing to check it in to the *sandbox* which has 
explicit warnings about broken code.   Once it is there it
can be worked on incrementally... perhaps by people other
than me.  If it stays private then we will have N people
working on the same thing without a chance of collaboration.

I would hardly call it an extra burden, calling it insane is a
bit over-the-top...  in any case, the refactor makes sense even
without users -- runApp is quite large and the code to fetch
the passphrase really belongs more up-stream.

I'm not defending twistd, but it does seem to have a wee
bit more functionality than making twisted applications
into daemons.   Perhaps you should refactor it by moving
what *you* think twistd should be into its own module
and make it callable from twistd.   Something like
twisted.python.daemonize would be clean.  No?

Best,

Clark

Subject: [Twisted-Python] coding standard: plurals for database table names
Message-ID: <20030406175304.GA756@doublegemini.com>

I noticed  in the Twisted Coding Standard that...

   "Database tables shall be named with plural nouns"

I'd like to question this standard for several reasons:

  1. There is not one single rule for forming plurals.
     In particular, some plurals have the same spelling
     as their singluar, 'deer'; furthermore some plurals
     have different forms, 'people' instead of 'persons'.
     Sometimes it is 's' or 'es'.  These differences are
     especially hard for those who have English as a 
     a second language.
     
  2. Tables are to rows as classes are to instances.
     We name Classes singluar, and as such tables should
     also be singluar.  This makes mapping rules easier.

  3. It is helpful to name foreign key columns as the
     same name as the table that they are coming from.
     And it makes little sense to use plurals for 
     column names, for example, when the person table
     may have a 1-M relationship with address, it could
     have a 'address' column name, which is obviously
     a foreign key to the 'address' table.   If you used
     plurals for the table name it brings up the 
     question... do you use plurals for the column name?
     I've seen it done.  *ick*

  4. I often use the double underscore method for link
     tables which represent M-M relationships.  In this
     case good names are hard to find.  For example, a
     link from a person to their address... how do you
     name this?   I use person__address.  If you use
     plurals then this becomes persons__addresses, 
     dooable but ugly.

  5. While there are astechic reasons for this (above)
     the resons become all the more important when 
     you want to build automatic tools for searching

What if you have more than one foreign key to the same 
table?  A very simple example (from my app ;^):  the 
attributes "owner", "creator", and "modifier" all point 
to the "persons" table.  As a rule of thumb, it's usually 
best to name the foreign key column after the role that 
the foreign key entity plays in the referring table.

I didn't think it was all that difficult.  I can send you
the O-R mapping I use, if you like.

One could reasonably argue that it is not important to have 
a table-naming rule in the coding standard.  I don't really 
care either way, but I happen to like using plural names for 
tables, and I'll use it regardless of what the Twisted coding std 
says anyhow, because I use my own O-R mapping instead of t.e.row 
(mine is different from t.e.row in many ways, but it does map plural 
table names to singular object names ;^).

Cheers,

A combination of both is best - i.e.

CONT_Contact
  CONT_ContactID FirstName LastName CONT_ContactTypeID

CONT_ContactType
  CONT_ContactTypeID Name

CONT_Organization
  CONT_OrganizationID Name Address

CONT_xref_Contact_Organization
  CONT_ContactID CONT_OrganizationID

CONT_ContactTypeID is a primary key on CONT_ContactType, and a foreign
key on CONT_Contact.  The xref table CONT_xref_Contact_Organization is
obviously a relationship between Contacts and Organizations, and
CONT_ContactID is obviously a foreign key to CONT_Contact.

If you structure tables / references like this, it's very difficult to
miss a bug where the wrong fields are being joined.  This still falls in
line with the recommendation that table names should be singular.

I agree that the Table-Row relationship is similar to the Class-Instance
relationship.  I think that the existence of object relational mappers
like t.e.row support this paradigm.  It is easy to understand the
mapping of programmatical information into the structure of the database
if you can name a class after a table.  Then you have instances of
CONT.Contact and references to a CONT.ContactType instance and one or
more CONT.Organization instances.

You can create higher level objects to further the abstraction, having a
Contact with an organization and type attribute.

I would like to see the O-R mapping that you use, simply to compare
ideas..  I still think singular table names are more logical ;p

I think that my version with the 'xref' in the name is more readable.

well, I beleive it's in the coding standard for the purpose of modules
that rely on a database schema of some sort.  It never hurts to develop
your code in line with the standards of a large framework you're using,
and if it doesn't make sense, you could question it (as we're doing
now).

I'm working on a patch that may allow this for key columns..

This will work but imho is a bit silly and not generally the way that I
expect a database application to work.  If I set the default value on a
column, I shouldn't have to handle that in my code.  Additionally, if
you have a large development team with a DBA who manages the DB schema,
changing the default value for a column shouldn't require a db change
_and_ a code change.. that's inefficient and bug prone..

> It would be nice to make t.e allow for default values and db-generated

I don't really see how allowing key columns to be ignored on an insert
would be database specific..  Ideally, whether or not a default value is
supplied by the database could be kept in rowColumns.  You could then
set a value to allow or disallow setting of key columns with a default
value provided by the database.  This would prevent twisted from
encountering errors, so long as you define your schema correctly. 
Additionally, it would be better for referential integrity's sake..

Anyway, I'd appreciate any comments on my ideas.  I'm evaluating
twisted, including t.e.row, as part of a proposal to migrate our entire
python toolkit to soap or xml-rpc using twisted.  Getting t.e.row to
work in such a way that our large database (515 relations, including
sequences) will not be at risk will be an important part of this task.

Cheers,

-Justin

You don't have to use t.e.row with Twisted. You can use any other
object/relational mapping system, or a custom one. That being said, the
row maintainer is no longer working on it, so if you want to take it up
and work on it that would be nice.

I would very much like to do this.  I've been digging around the code
and I feel pretty comfortable with it.  When you say that row has been
abandoned, does that include the reflectors and such as well?

Message-ID: <20030406224043.GA22604@mumak.net>


I've just attempted to generate API docs for twisted using epyrun, which uses
microdom. 

This fails when run with CVS latest, giving a "TypeError: unhashable instance"
when trying to hash a tuple of microdom.Element and something else.

At Moshe's suggestion, I removed the __eq__ methods from microdom in my local
copy, and generated the docs again. It generates the docs fine, but tests
break. Further, I was told that including the __eq__ methods makes the
behaviour of microdom incompatible with that of minidom, and that this is a
really bad thing.

I'm too zonked to patch things properly atm; could someone please fix microdom
and test_xml to not use / rely on __eq__ methods?

cheers,
jml

How do you fire it exactly ? Moreover, the tutorial about deferred isn't so

I was thinking of using only one flow. It's weird to seperate this process
in several flow, isn't it ?

Hmm, what's the point of this? I thought any files you create get
stored in the _trial_temp directory (because trial os.chdir()s, or
something), which is explicitly left around for post-mortem
debugging. Or were these tests creating files explicitly in other
locations?

I think all that needs to be done is to add a __hash__ method. Just
make it return id(self) (which is how all instances are hashed by
default -- unless they have an __eq__, for some reason).

I don't know what's up with the microdom/minidom compatibility,
though.

The one in CVS is a bit better, bu t it still isn't by

Yes.  In my original version, when you see 'flow' think of
a pipeline.  It was the first approximation.  I'm not totally
happy with it...

Well, your diagram sort of implies a parallel nature, which 
wasn't part of my original requirements.  I have that need
now, so flow needs to be updated to respect this.

If you want to go over this via phone, and you are in the US
or Canada I'd be happy to drop you a line... just send me
your phone number and a good time.

Both test_journal and test_logfile use tempfile.mktemp(), which creates new
directories in /tmp. Neither one removed the generated files (test_logfile
had code to do it, but it was commented out). pyramid had nearly a thousand
spurious /tmp/@1234.5 directories, all owned by me because the buildbot was
creating another dozen or so each time the test suite got run.

Those two tests could probably be modified to create temp file in the current
directory, but that change seemed like it had a higher probability of
failing.

cheers,
 -Brian

PS: folks who have run tests on pyramid, please check /tmp/ (and /tmp in the
sid-chroot) for leftover @1234.5 directories and delete them. You'll have to
do a 'chmod a+rwx' on them first because of a bug in the old cleanup code
(chmod(777) instead of chmod(0777)).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] [PATCH] row / reflector / sqlreflector - case insensitive
 tables/columns
Message-ID: <1049689666.6953.355.camel@qutang.gnubian.org>

Attached is a patch (cvs diff -u) to twisted.enterprise.row (and related
code).  Specifically, it affects the following files:

twisted/enterprise/row.py
twisted/enterprise/reflector.py
twisted/enterprise/sqlreflector.py
twisted/enterprise/util.py

The purpose is to allow for case-sensitive table/column names.  For me,
there are two parts to this:

(1) lots of comparisons in twisted use string.lower
(RowObject.__getattr__(), etc..).  There, theoretically, shouldn't be
any column names that are the same except for their case, but it still
seems logical to allow for case-sensitivity.  This change depends on the
RowObject's case_sensitive_relations attribute (which must be set by
child classes).

(2) I use postgres, and postgres requires you to enclose mixed-case
relation names in double quotes.  Thus, twisted needs to quote table
names, column names, etc..  This change depends on the sqlreflector's
quote_relations attribute, which can be passed as a keyword paramater to
sqlreflector.__init__().

I have given this some basic testing, but am mostly posting it for
scrutiny whilst I continue to work on it.  I think there are some areas
that can be improved, but it works and is pretty clean.

I think that this would be an appropriate time to state my intent to
become the maintainer of the row code, since it has apparently become
abandoned.  I have several other changes in mind, including the ability
to insert new rows without setting their primary keys and such, but I
thought that I should start submitting patches for little stuff to make
sure that the code I'm writing is sane for twisted.

TIA,

-Justin

I don't think I fully articulated my thoughts. Currently the 'reflector'
code caches the rows you create. So, ideally, if the database is going
to set default values on a new row, you'd like the reflector to update
the row object with whatever values the database chose to maintain
consistency between the row object and the database. I haven't
thought about it too closely, but it seems to me that there's no
way to implement that in a database-independent way, but maybe I'm
just missing something.

What do you think?

One strategy I used was to subclass SQLReflector for postgres
databases like so:

class PGSQLReflector(SQLReflector):

    def newRow(self, row_class, template=None):
        return self.runInteraction(self._newRow, row_class, template)

    def _newRow(self, transaction, row_class, template=None):
        row = row_class()

        if template is not None:
            for column, _ in row_class.rowColumns:
                if (hasattr(template, column) and
                    not getKeyColumn(row_class, column)):
                    setattr(row, column, getattr(template, column))

        for key, _ in row_class.rowKeyColumns:
            sql = "SELECT NEXTVAL('%s');" % row_class.keyGenerators[key]
            transaction.execute(sql)
            val = transaction.fetchone()[0]
            row.assignKeyAttr(key, long(val))

        return row

This requires that you specify the names of the sequences used
to generate the keys in the row class. Obviously this code isn't
very general, since it assumes keys will always be generated by 
sequences.

For your extensions which allow defaults, it might be better
to insert the row and then use the 'lastval' function to find
out what key was assigned to the row.

Welll...

I think that if you insert a row and allow the database to assign the
pkey, you can select out the pkey.  I'm not sure this is more efficient
than selecting nextval() before insert, but it would be more
database-independent..

Can you subclass KeyFactory to do something like this I wonder?

Not a bad idear - I missed this before sending my last post.  I beleive
that what I may do is allow for this in an abstract, db-independent way,
and then provide an example PSQLReflector that is db-dependent.  We
shall see ;p

Thanks again!

Some databases have an efficient way to get the key for the last row that
was inserted.  MySQL, for example, has mysql_insert_id() and
LAST_INSERT_ID():

Yes. Looks like we could use this as a basis for a cReactor, and
automatically get platform specific high-performance I/O. There might be
some benefit in a python reactor using a C extension, but that is less
certain.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted systems talking to one another
Message-ID: <200304071500.09093.mclay@python.net>

Are there any examples of having two twisted servers exchanging information. 
The scenario I need to automate is one in which an Original Equipment 
Manufacturer (OEM) negotiating a contract with an Electronic Manufacturer 
Systems (EMS) company. The EMS would procure parts and build a product, such 
as a generic personal computer, a router, or some other type of electronics 
that are mass produced, but with very short product lifecycles.

In this scenario the OEM would use PerspectiveBroker to publish the content of 
a Request for Quote. The contents of the product data package would not be 
entirely revealed to potential bidders. The data would be gradually made 
available based on the state of negotiation in the contracting process. This 
pattern parallels the gradual disclouse of information about the virtual 
world in a MUDD game. 

The trading partners who may wish to bid on the RFQ would copy the initial RFQ 
announcement to the local server where they could run an analysis program 
over the basic contract requirements. If the initial requirements look 
promising they would submit a request for additional information, passing in 
their qualifications in exchange for the added information. A non-disclosure 
agreement would be part of this exchange. Then eventually goal would be to 
respond to the RFQ with a quote and receive a contract to build the OEMs 
product. Between the initial receipt of the RFQ and the sending of the quote 
the two servers would engage in a series of moderated transactions for 
negotiating the terms and conditions for the contract, as well as negotiating 
the schedule for delivery and the potential to substitute parts in the 
assembly process. Some of the transactions between the two companies could be 
totally automated, while others may require human intervention in the 
decision making process.

According to the PerspectiveBroker documents I think this process could be 
made to work. One problem will be in setting up a universal authentication 
mechanism. This may just require using LDAP at all trading partnet sites and 
then federating the LDAP servers into a trading community. I haven't done 
something like that before, so that might be a bit of a challenge.

There are standards for the informationthat need to be used during the 
transactions (RosettaNet and OAG define that XML representations of documents 
such as an RFQ; and IPC defines representations for bills of materials of 
parts to be used and full product data packages), so I won't need to make up 
that part of the system. The rules governing the negotiations are partially 
defined in the workflow definitions of the document standards. I think most 
of the effort will be in building Gtk user interfaces and building the 
business logic to support the interaction between the trading partners. Each 
stage in the negotiation process needs to be scripted and a user interface 
needs to be created. 

So back to my original question. Are their examples that do something similar, 
perhaps in a different context. Do TwistedMatrix MUDD worlds talk to each 
other, do characters and materials shift between worlds, or is each world 
operating in isolation?

I can envision how the operation of the trading partner community could be 
created as a game, or manufacturing simulation environment. Once the bugs 
were worked out the simulator could be used to build and manage a real world 
virtual manufacturing community. Anyone care to estimate how long it might 
take to build the game version of the system using Twisted? I'm too new to 
the software to have a clue on what will be involved.

If there is more than one role, I usually use 'role_table'
for my foreign keys.  Otherwise it gets to be a bit messy,
especially if you use inheritance of sorts (there is not
only a person table but also an employee table, etc.) in
that case, 'creator' isn't good enough in some cases, you
may mean 'employee_creator' as not all person objects 
may be possible of creating.

I disagree.

While I don't feel particularly strongly about it one way or another, 
pretty much anything that isn't language-mandated ought to be 
standardized so that newcomers to the codebase at least get a common 
feel for certain kinds of naming.

Keep in mind that your personal coding standards need not adhere to the 
Twisted one - that standard is only for code actually checked in to the 
Twisted tree.  It may even be useful for products to diverge, so that 
someone reading code, schemas, or whatever can easily guess which 
components are from which codebase.

That would only work if twisted is the only process adding rows,
I think.

I feel almost embarrassed to bring this item up, as it seems so
trivial... but I think it deserves to be reviewed.

Everything else in the coding standard is very clear and resonably 
justified.  This particular item just stands out from the rest as 
quite arbitrary -- and based on my experience, giving addititional 
complexity without any commensurate advantages, especially for
those who do not have English as their primary language.

The English language can be quite complex, and Plurals and
their rules are a good part of this complexity.  For example,
plural nouns often sound the same as posessive nouns, and this
makes learning them more difficult.  Furthermore, plurals have
irregular forms, or use s or es, sometimes dropping one or more
letters before the modifier.  Even the notion of plurals themselves
is not really a universal construct, as I understand some 
languages use an adjective meaning 'one or more' in conjunction
with singluar nouns to make them plural rather than modifying
the word itself.  Some words are used as both singluar and 
plural.  And lastly, plurals enter into the whole range of 
collective nounds, which differ in their singluar/plural treatment 
depending if you are English or American.  In short, it's just ugly.  
And there isn't any advantage to *requiring* them; especially
when Internationalization is important.

The only somewhat-convincing argument that I've heared for it,
is that "SELECT * FROM people" seems to make more sense than
"SELECT * FROM person".  However, even this advantage falls
apart as soon as you add a where clause...  
   SELECT first_name FROM people 
   WHERE people.last_name = 'Evans'

I like person.last_name myself...

I feel that too much standardization can be a bad thing, 
especially when they bring unnecessary complexity.

The Twisted implementation lives in

from a non-native english speaker perspective... i don't understand why.
a WHERE clause can select more than just one persone, i.e., people.
using plurals seems correct and beautifull to me.

i don't seeany complexity in using plurals.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Windows <strike>i hate it</strike> Process API
Message-ID: <20030408024919.GG956@radii>

So, I've discovered[1] something new about Windows. Basically, there's
no such thing as `argv' in win32-land, and each program has to parse
its command-line manually (I had known that they had to do wild-card
expansion manually, but not parse the entire damned string). This
isn't so much the problem as there is no sane Win32 API for starting a
process with a sequence of arguments. The reason this is a problem is
that Twisted's Process API uses sequences of arguments.

In light of this, I have a few somewhat-orthogonal proposals to make,
but I think they should all be done (well, except, perhaps, the last):

 * Add a method to the Win32 Process Interface (IWin32Process?) that
   accepts a string rather than an executable and a list of args. We
   should allow people to use the (unfortunately) sanest method
   available for starting processes on Windows.

 * Add a warning to win32eventreactor.Process.__init__ (in the case
   that the user passed in a sequence of args) that tells people about
   this problem.

 * Add some auto-quoting evilness[2] to
   win32eventreactor.Process.__init__, for when arguments are passed
   as a sequence. What we have there absolutely sucks (" ".join), and we
   should probably at least try to make the existing API as reliable 
   as possible.

 * Perhaps make the string "command-line" API available on
   PosixProcess as well, so people can use either the string or the
   sequence API and expect at least some bit of cross-platformness (but
   I'm fine with telling people to just use the sequence API if others
   don't like this, especially considering this either requires
   calling out to a shell (gah), or doing some unfun argument-splitting.)

*whimper* :-(

It also doesn't use twisted.cred at the moment, so not only are the
resources it serves not pluggable, neither is the authentication.

I'm planning on doing an FTP server rewrite "soon", based on the new
infrastructure that the FTP client now uses (thanks to radix for helping me
with that!).  Given my track record at doing things "soon", I probably
wouldn't hold my breath, though :)

Unless the implementation has changed significantly since I last looked at
it, this is the correct answer.  The select call under win32 times out every
second so that Ctrl-C/Ctrl-Break and other things (like stopping a Twisted
program running as a WinNT service) happen in a timely fashion, rather than
relying on network activity to wake it up.

This is a new test, but an old problem.  The bug here is in the FTP server
(even though we wrote the test to test the new client support for STOR,
which seems to work just fine), and it hasn't changed for months.  On the
other hand, the failures are intermittent, and I suspect it's only a problem
in the test case (it's some sort of timing issue with having the same
process on either end of the socket, I think).

In short: the testStor test failure shouldn't hold up the release :)

Do you have a use-case where the current string-joining breaks?  And if a
Twisted user really cared about passing arguments on Win32, wouldn't it be
easiest to just let them take care of it, e.g.:
    if sys.platform == 'win32':
        args = ["one big string"]
    else:
        args = ["one", "big", string"]
    ...
    
?

I'm not sure that adding lots of platform-dependent infrastructure to
Twisted can offer anything better than that, anyway, so we may as well keep
it simple.

I'm willing to be proved wrong, though -- it's not like I use Win32 anymore
:)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I was talking with Kevin Turner at the pub last night after the "Porpig"
meeting, and he mentioned having the same problem with circular references I
was having, so I offered to post the klu... err, patch I had for the problem.


In short, it checks for _Dereference's (corresponding to dictionaries not yet
available) that are destined to be (erroneously) copied into the __dict__ of
an object that is then returned.  When one is found, it is returned instead
without a containing object, and a method object is scheduled to be run
via postUnjelly.

Later on (in crefutil.py), after the _Derefence has been magically replaced
by it's corresponding dictionary, the dictionary is taken and stored in
the __dict__ of a newly created object.  Even later, the postUnjelly
scheduled earlier is called, which sets the __class__ of the manually
created object.


This is a pretty hideous fix!  But it is minimal, and I think unlikely to
have side effects.  Then again, I do not have a broad understanding of
twisted, and haven't tested it extensively...  Clearly what newjelly.py is
aiming for is superior, and so I haven't been inclined to invest any further
effort.

The cvs -u for the two files affected follows.  Use them as you wish, and
critique is always welcome.

Message-ID: <3E933CCA.3000508@enflyer.com>

	I know, I couldn't have possibly found something smaller. The warning was 
annoying me. This is a patch to FormErrorModel to add the request argument to 
the wmfactory method.

	Also, I was the one in #twisted this weekend asking about woven.guard. I pretty 
much figured it out, it seems so easy now. I have some ideas for making it easy 
(subclassing PerspectiveWrapper) to use any resource to display the login prompt 
(not the auto-generated FormProcessor). Is this something I should submit, or 
does it already work that way and I was too dense to see it?

*Ahem*.

Ok, so it took slightly longer than that...

Thanks to working on this with Chris at PyCon, there is now STOR support for
the FTPClient, currently only in CVS, but it will be in the next release.

I didn't think of this. This is a fine alternative to having a
separate API method for it. So, that gets rid of proposal for a new
method. I'm still thinking about implementing that warning, though, as
well as the auto-quoting.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Default reactor without signal handling
Message-ID: <3E9384C4.4D26E913@engcorp.com>

In twisted.internet.reactor, a call to twisted.internet.default.install()
is made automatically.  That call constructs a SelectReactor with
signal handling enabled, without any option for avoiding this behaviour.

What's the recommended approach for installing a reactor without the
signal handling behaviour turned on?

(For the curious, I'm trying to refactor an existing Zope-based 
application which has a "back end" server using a proprietary 
protocol on a non-standard socket.  Currently we just use 
the Zope asyncore and built our stuff on top of that.  We're
trying to move away from Zope, and this looked like the low-hanging
fruit for getting us onto Twisted...   Everything worked fine
when we spiked this, except we had to manually patch the above
call to do "reactor = SelectReactor(0)" instead of what it does
now.

Thanks.

In 1.0.4 and CVS (soon to be released, we hope), you can do:

   reactor.run(installSignalHandlers=0)

Not sure. But I think this should be changed, it is useful for certain
things (e.g. trees of Resources) and we'll need it for WebDAV if we use
Resources for that.

I for one would really like it if this change were made. I have a base 
class that I always subclass instead of resource that does nothing but 
what this patch does.

It seems to be a little bit different from the cvs sandbox version !?

If you'll re-read what you quoted of me, you'll see that I was
proposing auto-splitting of the arguments, not passing the thing to a
shell. Concatenating is only required in win32; we've already _got_
the arguments in a list (or as my proposal went, in a single string)
from the high-level API.

But you're right about it being a bad idea :) I've decided (in absense
of any others' opinions) to just do auto-quoting-with-a-warning in
win32's case.

Actually, I guess my wording here was a little off. Instead of "gah",

[Recap:  Last night, Bob was complaining that the order that services
were started and stopped was undefined, saying

Bob> well if you have service A dependent on service B
Bob> and you don't want service A to actually start service B
Bob> like let's say you have a database service or something
Bob> and you have another service that wants to persist stuff using the
Bob> database service

so he made the order in which services are started defined as the order
in which they were added to the service collection, and the reverse for
stopping.]

Bob, I fear this solution is too fragile if your services really depend
on one another.  While it will work for now when installing services is
something that happens once in mktap, I fear it'll break down with more
dynamic service management.  Example::

    application.addService("dataStore", StupidStorage())
    application.addService("dataMaker", FooService())

    # ...later, decide we have outgrown StupidStorage:
    application.removeService("dataStore")
    application.addService("dataStore", RealStorage())

With your ordering, the new dataStore will now stop before dataMaker
does.

Instead of introducing ordering dependencies into the flat top-level
service namespace, I think the right answer to your problem is to do as
Chris suggested: Use a hierarchical structure by making dataStore a
MultiService, and adding any dataMaker services at its children.  That
way your dataStore can always make sure its children shut down before it
does.

Does this work for you?  If so, I would like to revert your changes
making Application.services an OrderedDict before the (imminent!)
release, just because anything that requires a change to the
persistnceVersion is a big potential spot for trouble.  We have no
inter-version testing framework at all.

(This whole thing would have passed without comment had I not
encountered an error in upgradeVersion13 in the acceptance tests.  I
*think* I fixed that bug, but I haven't yet found out what triggered it
in the first place (it *should* have been *generated* with version 13,
why was it upgrading?), and who knows what other uglies are hiding in
the dark corners of application persistence.)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] twistd causing AssertionError, exiting abruptly
Message-ID: <20030409202249.GA4696@polynode.com>

When I run 'twistd -nf web.tap', twistd spits out the following traceback
and exits.  I'm really not sure what this means; help?

This is a fresh CVS copy.

Well nomatter what, unless it uses 
application.getServiceNamed("dataStore") everywhere, you just broke 
dataMaker.  If you're changing the storage you have bigger things to 
worry about than this little corner case.  You need to pause/stop 
FooService, export all the data from the existing storage, stop the 
existing storage, start the new storage, import all the data into the 
new storage, change FooService's reference to the new storage, 
resume/start FooService, and cross your fingers.

It is a good feature that services get started and stopped in a 
sensible order, there's no reason they shouldn't.  I didn't want to 
change the implementation to a list because that would've required more 
code to change, and had the capability to break existing stuff because 
there is no API iterate an AbstractServiceCollection (or the bastard 
Application class, which should be one but doesn't mixin IIRC).

That's only an issue if you use persisted Application objects, I don't. 
  What if you want to stop the storage without stopping it's children?  
In some cases, my ApplicationServices only depend on the storage for 
initialization anyways, so it wouldn't make sense to force them to shut 
down when the storage does.

You can take out the version upgrade if it doesn't work.  I used an 
OrderedDict for that reason, it has the same interface as a normal 
dict..  so no change to the code (other than stopping in reverse order 
of keys, which will still work on a regular dict, and __init__ of 
course) were made.  The upgrade was purely so new services added to old 
application objects would have their start/stop order preserved.

work in progress on my understanding of extrepum's flow... not
in anyway near perfect

-------------

''' Flow -- async data flows

    This is a flow module which is used for async data flows, 
    in particularly those coming from databases where blocking
    behavior is common.   Implementations will typically use
    generators (or anything implementing the iterator protocol)
    for each stage of the flow.

    Basically, communication within the data flow is carried
    out using the yield statement.  Besides using 'return' 
    or throwing a StopIteration exception, there are several
    items which yield can return:

       flow.Yield      This (singleton) value should be returned when an
                       operation would block, it gives other micro-threads
                       a chance to do their work.

       flow.Callable   A callable object should be returned when a function
                       should be executed.  This adds another stage to the
                       flow. These objects have a 'result' attribute which 
                       is filled in with the output of the function, or a 
                       subclass of failure.Failure for exceptions.

       flow.Iteration  An iterable object, that is, a generator, or array,
                       or class which implements both next() and __iter__.
                       These objects, like Callable, have a 'result' 
                       attribute, but also have a stop attribute which
                       is true when StopIteration has been thrown.

       <anything>      Any other return value

Hello Clarck

Your post is in a wrong thread...

BTW, how do you test this ? It seems to be good (well written), but I'm
not sure to exactly understand what you wanted to do.

If I sum up (from my point of view) :

Callable  : may be a function bloc that run only once
Iteration : may be a function bloc that loop on something (like a
datasource)
and Yield : hum, what's the point of Yield ?


Anyway, this version if different from the one on your website.

The basic pattern, as put forth by extrepum in his post a while back...
http://www.twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2003-February/002808.html
is that you implement your Flow object using a generator...


   def mygenerator():
       print "dosomething"
       d = SubGenerator()
       yield d
       print d.result
       d = AnotherSubGenerator()
       yield d
       print d.result
    
...

 
''' Flow -- async data flow

    This module provides a mechanism for using async data flows through
    the use of generators.  While this module does not use generators in
    its implementation, it isn't very useable without them.

    A data flow starts with a top level generator, which has numerous
    yield statements.   Each yield can return one of several types:

        flow.Cooperate  This (singleton) value should be returned when 
                        the flow would like to give up control of the 
                        call stack to allow other events to be handled.

        flow.Generator  This is a sub-flow (iterator) to be executed.  
                        This object has a 'result' value which can be 
                        checked for each value yielded.   If the last
                        iteration of the sub-flow produced an exception,
                        then a failure.Failure object will be returned.

                        While the sub-flow is generating (it has not
                        returned or raised StopIteration), it will have
                        an 'active' state of true.  Once it is finished,
                        the 'active' state will be false.

       <anything>       Any other return value, which is not a FlowItem

	The path you are passing to mktap web for HTTP request log is somehow

Clark, this is just an alogithme I was thinking of, before I found flow.py

I had to manage different flows in one application.

DS1 ----> BLOC1 ---+
                   |
DS2 ----> BLOC2 ---+---- BLOC3 -----> DS3

is an exemple of what it could be. Every thing is a bloc. DSx are 
datasources (there are also blocs). BLOCx are some treatment bloc that 
operate with their inputs, and provide the result on their outputs.

this is the algorithm comming with :

all bloc are "inactive"
for bloc in blocs:
    if len(bloc.inputs) is 0:
        bloc is "active" # it should be a datasource/producer


gotData(bloc, lines) :
    for line in lines:
        fill in connected blocs's inputs with outputs
        connected blocs are active
        while connected blocs's inputs are set:
            wait # I know, this sucks
    bloc is inactive

while there are still active blocs  
    for bloc in blocs
        if all inputs are available (!= None)
            bloc.proceed().addCallback(gotData)
        

# Fin algo #################################

This doesn't work because we wait for blocs to finish their jobs, and never 
come back to main loop...

This means also that I have to define a mapping between inputs / outputs of 
blocs. I can't see such thing in flow.py, that's maybe why I don't 
understand it well.

I wish I was clear enough :p

Subject: [Twisted-Python] woven guard patch and example
Message-ID: <018e01c2ff72$eb3cf330$6501a8c0@richdesk>

The woven.guard patch attached contains one minor bug fix (changing a
reference in GuardSession.checkExpired from self.site.sessions to
self.guard.sessions). Also, it slightly modifies PerspectiveWrapper to make
using alternate resources for a login page easier.

The example file attached demonstrates using woven.guard with the patch
applied. If anyone wants I can post an example of use without the patch.

Ok.  So, basically, you have an input queue for each
code block, and when a particular condition on the 
queue is triggered, the code block fires.  For BLOC1,
it'd be any input from DS1, for BLOC2, it'd be input
from DS2.  For BLOC3, it'd be both input from BLOC1
and BLOC2.  

This is interesting.  With the new-improved flow 
(aka extrepum's method), this would be listed as
3 generators... plus 2 built-in generators.

DS1 = flow.QueryIterator("some query")
DS2 = flow.QueryIterator("another query")

def BLOC1:
    ds1 = flow.Generator( DS1 )
    yield ds1   # think of as ds1.next()
    while ds1.active:
        result = ds1.result   # value of ds1.next()
        //
        // process ds1.result, possibly
        // sending the result to the next
        // stage using:   yield result
        //
        yield ds1

def BLOC2:
    ds2 = flow.Generator( DS2 )
    yield ds2
    while ds2.active:
        result = ds2.result
        //
        // process ds2, calling yield result
        // to pass on value to next stage
        //
        yield ds2

def BLOC3:
    bl1 = flow.Generator(BLOC1())
    bl2 = flow.Generator(BLOC2())
    yield bl1; yield bl2
    while bl1.active and bl2.active:
        // do somethign with bl1.result and bl2.result
        yield bl1; yield bl2

d = flow.DeferredFlow(BLOC3)
d.addBoth(lambda x: print 'done')
reactor.start()

I'll make a test like this for the flow module so that
it's more clear.   This is such a *HUGE* improvement over
what I was doing... thank you _so_ much extrepum.

Best,

;) Clark

And thank you _so_ much Clark, this starts to make sence to me. When flow
will be finished, it would be a great part of Twisted, and a good
demonstration of generators. I habe great hopes in it :)

Just a question, where the QueryIterator is defined ? I can't find it in
your last post. (Flow just inheritate form object, QueryIterator would be
defined in object ?? hum...)

kind regards,
Philippe

Twisted 1.0.4alpha2 has been released at last.  The reason it's marked
"alpha" rather than "release candidate" is because
accepttests.runMailTest fails.

It is in the CVS version of flow.py... which may not perfectly work
till later this evening.     A copy included below.

''' Flow -- async data flow

    This module provides a mechanism for using async data flows through
    the use of generators.  While this module does not use generators in
    its implementation, it isn't very useable without them.

    A data flow starts with a top level generator, which has numerous
    yield statements.   Each yield can return one of several types:

        flow.Cooperate  This (singleton) value should be returned when 
                        the flow would like to give up control of the 
                        call stack to allow other events to be handled.

        flow.Generator  This is a sub-flow (iterator) to be executed.  
                        This object has a 'result' value which can be 
                        checked for each value yielded.   If the last
                        iteration of the sub-flow produced an exception,
                        then a failure.Failure object will be returned.

                        While the sub-flow is generating (it has not
                        returned or raised StopIteration), it will have
                        an 'active' state of true.  Once it is finished,
                        the 'active' state will be false.

       <anything>       Any other return value, which is not a FlowItem

Subject: [Twisted-Python] twisted.news cleanups and tests
Message-ID: <20030410213554.GA58576@mithrandr.moria.org>

Hi,

I'd like to know what people think about the following patch and tests.

These are my first tests for Twisted, so I'm not sure whether I'm
stepping over any style rules.

The patch fixes the unusability of NewsShelf due to dirdbm wanting to
try use directories as files.  It also stops us from putting '\n\r\n'
into the start of the body, and it puts '\r\n' termination on the last
line of the headers.  It moves placing the extra '\r\n' between the
headers and body in the one place it's necessary - articleRequest.

I haven't tested NewsStorage or NewsStorageAugmentation yet, but these
changes shouldn't be a problem.

The test cases detect the problems listed above, and perform some
general sanity tests.

Thanks,

Neil

Subject: [Twisted-Python] rewrite of flow.py completed
Message-ID: <20030411073834.GB11627@doublegemini.com>

Ok.  The complete re-write of flow.py based on the work of 
extrepum ("Bob Ippolito") is finished, with a test case
checked in.  This differs from extrepum's work [1] in 
some ways, but is almost identical in others.

1.  The implementation and test suite does not use generators,
    thus it is safe for 2.1 usage... although I can't imagine
    anyone using it without generators.   But the advantage 
    is that it could go into the current Twisted code base.
    The test suite uses iterators (with the corresponding
    generator commented out).

2.  This implementation has 4 distinct components:

    a) the core 'Flow' class and its supporting items, could be
       put into something like twisted.python.flow as they only
       depend upon other twisted.python stuff.  

    b) There is a DeferredFlow which uses Flow as a mix-in with
       Deferred, with behavior similar to DeferredList.  This 
       could go into twisted.internet.defer

    c) There is a ThreadedIterator which depends upon DeferredFlow, 
       and can be used to merge blocking behavior into the 
       framework.   This could go into twisted.internet.threads

    d) There is a very small class which builds upon ThreadedIterator
       that uses a pool from twisted.enterprise.adbapi; however, 
       in this context the async features of adbapi more or less
       get in the way.   So, perhaps this is best left as an example.

    In particular, extrepum's work build on top of Deferred, which
    I think is unnecessary; thus quite a bit of simplification 
    occurred when stripping out the Deferred stuff, and instead
    treating DeferredFlow as a cross product or mix-in of 
    Flow and Deferred.

3.  Extrepum's work was more 'flat' and didn't take recursive
    use of the technique into consideration; or perhaps I just 
    didn't understand how it would handle recursive usage.
    In any case, this implementation allows generators to call
    other generators and provides a nice stack unwinding, etc.

4.  I'd like to eventually look more at extrepum's work to 
    see if he had additional aspects that I've missed.  If 
    those aspects are generally useable, then I'll include 
    them.

Anyway, that's about it.  I'm now rebuilding some of my internal
code to use this module and ripping the old flow.py out.  This 
flow overall has been *greatly* simpler usage -- and I can't
thank extrepum enough for pointing me to his usage of generators
to create async flows within Twisted.

I'd also like to thank Itamar, Moshez, Radix, and Exarkun for
helping me along and pointing me in the right directions.

Best,

Clark

""" Flow -- async data flow

    This module provides a mechanism for using async data flows through
    the use of generators.  While this module does not use generators in
    its implementation, it isn't very useable without them.   A data flow
    is constructed with a top level generator, which can have three 
    types of yield statements:  flow.Cooperate, flow.Generator, or
    any other return value with exceptions wrapped using failure.Failure

Jasper: thanks so much for investigating this one!

I think Glyph finally nailed this bug in some code that went into CVS a few
days ago. It should be in the latest release (1.0.4a2). Could you give that a
try and see if it fixes your original bug? The test case that exarkun added
now passes, but I'd like to make sure your code is now working too.

thanks!

I didn't have much choice, as the objects I'm transporting are circular. ;-)

Unfortunately it doesn't work for me. :-(

The simple test case at the end of test_newjelly.py _does_ work, but the
orignal more verbose test I posted (using pb) doesn't work, getting the same
__dict__ error as before.

So I tried replacing jelly.py with newjelly.py, with my fingers crossed.
Both the unit test and my "acceptence" test then work, but my code still
doesn't work...  Arg!

The error is from the assertion on line 40 of crefutil.py:
class NotKnown:                                   |
    ...                                           |
    def addDependant(self, mutableObject, key):   |
        assert not self.resolved  <---------------+

Here're updated versions of the patch and the test case.  We also pass
test_nntp now...

Well nomatter what, unless it uses 
application.getServiceNamed("dataStore") everywhere, you just broke 
dataMaker.  If you're changing the storage you have bigger things to 
worry about than this little corner case.  You need to pause/stop 
FooService, export all the data from the existing storage, stop the 
existing storage, start the new storage, import all the data into the 
new storage, change FooService's reference to the new storage, 
resume/start FooService, and cross your fingers.

It is a good feature that services get started and stopped in a 
sensible order, there's no reason they shouldn't.  I didn't want to 
change the implementation to a list because that would've required more 
code to change, and had the capability to break existing stuff because 
there is no API iterate an AbstractServiceCollection (or the bastard 
Application class, which should be one but doesn't mixin IIRC).

That's only an issue if you use persisted Application objects, I don't. 
  What if you want to stop the storage without stopping it's children?  
In some cases, my ApplicationServices only depend on the storage for 
initialization anyways, so it wouldn't make sense to force them to shut 
down when the storage does.

You can take out the version upgrade if it doesn't work.  I used an 
OrderedDict for that reason, it has the same interface as a normal 
dict..  so no change to the code (other than stopping in reverse order 
of keys, which will still work on a regular dict, and __init__ of 
course) were made.  The upgrade was purely so new services added to old 
application objects would have their start/stop order preserved.

Dear Twisted Users,

In the last few months, Twisted seems to have become exponentially more 
popular.  I need to create more graphs and charts that show this in a 
systematic way, but I can certainly tell you that my bandwidth has been 
utilized more than it was in the past.

As many of you know, I host twistedmatrix.com in my home, on a 
"business DSL" line.  All of the Twisted developers use this machine, 
for running tests, running their own development servers, and checking 
their email.  It also runs the twistedmatrix.com web site and CVS 
server.  I like this set-up since it makes it relatively easy to make 
backups quickly, upgrade the hardware on this machine to meet demand, 
and "eat our own dog food": use various Twisted services in production.

With increased popularity comes increased traffic.  While the CPU of 
our development system remains at near-idle load, the bandwidth here is 
clearly inadequate.  Also, although I do nominally run a business here 
(a few *very* small odd hosting jobs) that's certainly not paying the 
full cost of keeping business DSL running.  I also don't really have a 
good enough set-up to set up a sensible contribution plan like the 
http://www.gnu-darwin.org/ site.

So, if you would like to see better performance out of the 
twistedmatrix.com site, I've finally gotten a personal PayPal "donate" 
button working that you can send contributions to.  You can find it on 
my personal website:

	http://www.twistedmatrix.com/users/glyph/scribbles/

Please include "bandwidth" in the "special instructions" field that you 
see when you send a contribution.  Also, please don't contribute 
anything if you're struggling yourself.  The developers should be 
beneficiaries of such contributions, not the donors.

Be advised that if I were to somehow become fabulously wealthy from 
these contributions, it would definitely be a good thing for the 
project as a whole ;-).

In related news, we are working on a plan to recognize folks and 
companies who have contributed to development of particular areas of 
Twisted.  As-yet-unacknowledged sponsors include Zoteca, Divmod, and 
Ninjaneering.  If you'd like to be a sponsor of a particular area of 
Twisted development, I'd like to hear from you.

Sometime soon there will definitely be a more structured way to 
organize such efforts, but until then, every little bit helps.  I 
encourage other Twisted developers to get other similar "donate" 
buttons - I would like to put up a "tip jar" page at some point where 
users can select a developer and contribute something.

Thank you so much Clark ! 
BTW, I'd like to test flow.py for my own student projects, but documentation
is in several threads on the newsgroup. Moreover, they are sometimes for
deprecated versions of flow.py. The best would be to write a little
tutorial, and include it in the HOWTO documentation. flow.py would be so
clear for most people.

I'd like to sea some real exemples with QueryIterator and the way to manage
several flow in an application.

If you need some help to write it, maybe I can write some specific parts.
But due to my poor english, this will be painful for me :-p

Just some questions : 

- will flow.py be included in Twisted 1.0.4 (rc) ? 
- Did you write some unit tests ?
- could you add the outpout of your exemple (at the beginning of flow.py) ?


- In QueryIterator :

"
            self.curs = conn.cursor()
            if self.data: self.curs.execute(self.sql % self.data) 
"
but :

>>> 'cursor' in dir (adbapi.ConnectionPool)
0

I think you want to use a 'standard' pool corresponding to API DB 2.0
twisted.entreprise.adbapi.ConnectionPool doesn't have a cursor method.
NTL, it's just the right use of flow, because we don't want a deffered here
(because of thread use).



kind regards
Philippe

  Niel,

   Thanks!  I've neglected t.news for too long.  It looks like there are
some good fixes in here.

    I notice there's a fix for parsing headers with continuations included
here too, which is cool.  I don't think I was even aware of such things when
I wrote the code originally - what seems apparent to me now, though, is that
Article either shouldn't exist at all, or that it should grow into (and move
somewhere appropriate for) a fully-fledged, asynchronous message parser that
can be used throughout Twisted wherever email-like messages need to be dealt
with.

    In the test cases, you also used assert_() (but just once, I assume it
was an oversight), which shouldn't be access directly by tests cases, so I
changed this to a failUnless().  Also, I personally make it a point to turn
string module calls into string method calls when cleaning up code, and so
have done this as well.

    All in all, nice work.

says who?  why not?  I've always thought it was just an alternative
spelling of failUnless, and that it has the dangling underscore simply
because 'assert' is a keyword in Python.

  Says me!  Rar!  I thought we only still supported it because PyUnit had
it.  In any case, it *is* bound to the same function as failUnless, so it
makes no practical difference, and I'm certainly not the authority for
Trial.  Multiple spellings for the same thing sucks, though, and given a
choice between the two, I'd pick failUnless() any day.

IIRC, Trial's unittest module has multiple spellings for a lot of 
things.  What we should probably do is make a decision on one set of 
spellings and issue DeprecationWarnings for the rest.

If you look, the conn is created from self.pool.connect() which

the constructor take a connection, but this won't work as the
Twisted ADBAPI uses the current thread to find the connection, thus
pool.connect() must be run in the appropriate thread, which is
not the thread where the constructor for this class would be executed.

QueryIterator uses the ThreadedIterator.  ThreadedIterator basically
is two iterators that are 'linked' together, one in the main thread
and one in the thread which is allowed to block.  The two iterators
communicate with a shared list which holds intermediate output, ie,
it is the message queue from the iterator in the secondary thread 
to the primary thread.   Anyway, the iterator in the primary thread
is a simple 'proxy' like iterator, which raises Cooperate if there
isn't any data available from the secondary iterator.

Here is a simple example of how to make a ThreadedIterator...
note that the sleep(.1) call is not executed in the main 
thread -- that's the whole point of the ThreadedIterator.

        class CountIterator(flow.ThreadedIterator):
            def __init__(self, count):
                flow.ThreadedIterator.__init__(self)
                self.count = count
            def next(self): # this is run in a separate thread
                from time import sleep
                sleep(.1)
                val = self.count
                if not(val):
                    raise flow.StopIteration
                self.count -= 1
                return [val]
        def res(x): assert([5,4,3,2,1] == x)
        from twisted.internet import reactor
        f = flow.DeferredFlow(CountIterator(5))
        f.addCallback(res)
        reactor.callLater(2,reactor.stop)
        reactor.run()

Anyway, I made a bunch of checkins about a day ago to clean
up some of the documentation and to add the test_flow.py 

Best,

""" Flow ... async data flow

    This module provides a mechanism for using async data flows through
    the use of generators.  While this module does not use generators in
    its implementation, it isn't very useable without them.   A data flow
    is constructed with a top level generator, which can have three 
    types of yield statements:  flow.Cooperate, flow.Generator, or
    any other return value with exceptions wrapped using failure.Failure

Speaking of such message-unifying work:

Moshe and I were recently on IRC, discussing a unification of several 
disparate message representations within Twisted.  We're not exactly 
sure where this is going, but in a future release, the .mail, .words, 
and .news packages should all be unified, probably under the heading of 
"words", in order to present a coherent messaging API for things like 
bots which don't care whether you're talking to them through email, 
netnews, IRC, AOL IM, or whatever.

What this really means is that words is going to grow a 
"store-and-forward" mechanism as well as a "store-and-check" mechanism. 
  Also, a higher-level POP3 and IMAP client will be integrated for 
retrieval of messages.

twisted.im also needs to be refactored, in order to make its API more 
coherent and easier to register observers of.  However, it remains 
unclear whether this kind of functionality actually deserves a separate 
package (that .words will use) or whether it will go into .words 
directly.  Moshe has me mostly convinced that it should remain an 
independant package, since real-time-client code is going to look 
significantly different to abstract-message-processing-and-forwarding 
code.

Thoughts?

I'll be watching this with interest. I'm not going to say it's 
impossible or crazy, but I'd like to see how all the inherent 
difficulties in making a "generic messagey thing" are overcome.

 From the top of my head:
  - IMAP and NNTP have a bunch of folders, POP3 has just one.
  - IMAP lets you create folders and move messages about, NNTP doesn't.
  - Instant messaging apps have no folders, but you could no doubt 
synthesise an 'inbox'. Some IM systems let you have 'categories' of 
buddies, which you might present as message folders. However, then IM 
has the restriction that a given folder can only contain messages from 
one recipient, which is not the case with IMAP or NNTP.
  - POP3 and NNTP need to be polled for new messages, IM protocols alert 
you when a new message comes in. I'm not sure which way IMAP goes.
  - Email and usenet messages generally have a variety of interesting 
and useful headers that end-user applications are going to want to look 
at, IM messages do not.
  - IMAP and IM are stateful protocols, POP3 is not. I'm not sure about 
NNTP.
  - Email and usenet messages have message-threading, IM does not.

I can't see any sort of 'core feature set' and 'extension feature set' 
in the above list, more like every protocol and format cherry-picks the 
features it wants from a central store.

Another idea - of the various communication sources I personally use, 
they generally fall into 'IM-style (ICQ, IRC)' and 'email-style (email, 
usenet)' interfaces. One message source that I read in email-style that 
I have not yet seen mentioned is RSS. That would be an interesting 
thing to add to  a Universal Messaging client, wouldn't it? :)

Message-ID: <20030413160743.GA8677@matilda.southern.edu>

Enlightened ones,

I'm trying to develop a small server for a checkers tournament that we
are trying to host in our school.  Students will submit their entries
that talk on stdin-stdout.  Our idea was to make a socket server that
receives all the connections and then makes them all play a tournament.
I've been thinking about doing it from scratch, just using an array of
connections somehow, but this has proven to be way more difficult than I
anticipated.  For one, I've had a difficult time trying to figure out a
way of 'managing' the server real-time.  I've come across twisted just a
day ago, and I'm wondering if I could make it work for me.  Is twisted
applicable to my problem?

I'd appreciate any an all input anyone can give me.  I am quite the
beginner in python, but I'm willing to read up anything that needs to be
read :)

Thanks a ton.

dansan.

But from a client perspective, everything but the inbox ends up 
locally.. so you could have the UI be just like IMAP or NNTP, you would 
just augment the POP3 account(s) with a local datastore.

So perhaps you just raise exceptions if you try and move messages on a 
NNTP server?

AIM has a "chat room" feature which would allow multiple participant 
'folders'

So you have a unified "notification center" type API.  Whether it gets 
notified async or needs to poll to generate notifications is just an 
implementation detail for each protocol.

IM messages have sender/recipient addresses and timestamps.. A chat 
room could have a bunch of "CC's".  What headers other than 
from/date/to/subject/etc are ever really that useful?

That's a protocol implementation detail.  Twisted is very good at 
stateful protocols.. just because POP3 isn't completely stateful 
(although it does keep state as to whether or not you're authenticated) 
doesn't really change anything.

>  - Email and usenet messages have message-threading, IM does not.

IM is sort of threaded.. each conversation with each person could be 
considered a thread.. It's certainly not like a conversation with a 
particular person is a set of completely unrelated messages (although 
it can be :).

  This is easy, POP3's single folder is IMAP4's "INBOX", and NNTP lives in
an entirely different namespace from regular IMAP4 folders.

  A related point: what isn't clear to me is how to handle the difference
between the practically required download-all-messages behavior of POP3, and
the complete opposite of IMAP4 and NNTP.

>  - IMAP lets you create folders and move messages about, NNTP doesn't.

  IMAP is allowed to reject these operations, so NNTP and POP3 could
just have this error behavior in all cases.

  Hmm.  No ideas from me here, yet.

  This is a kinda neat coincidence.  IMAP4 does both.  So we need both
behaviors, but POP3/NNTP will only use polling and IM will only use
notification.

  I'm not sure what the right answer is here.  One solution might be to add
headers to IM messages when exposing them through this API.  The information
for most of the common ones is available: From, Sender, Reply-To, To, Date
are obvious, CC and BCC are probably mostly empty (but ICQ used to support
multi-person chat, I don't know of any other protocols do, or if ICQ still
does); Subject is tough, and Message-ID I guess we'd generate ourself. 
Those are all the official "envelope" headers that are required to exist,
Subject being the only one that we really don't have information about -
perhaps giving users a way to tag exchanges with some value, or just leaving
it empty?

  OTOH, it makes sense to view IM messages in groups, not one at a time.  I
don't see how you could coherently add headers to more than one IM message.

>  - IMAP and IM are stateful protocols, POP3 is not. I'm not sure about 
> NNTP.

  NNTP isn't, unless you go into pipeline mode (which Twisted doesn't
support [well?]).  Can you go more into why this might be a problem?  I
think the protocol code should handle any issues raised by this, and present
a unified front to the messaging API.

>  - Email and usenet messages have message-threading, IM does not.

  I think you could do some neat stuff with temporal analysis and trainable
neural networks, but I've got exactly zero practical experience with either
of these techniques, so I won't say this isn't a potential problem :)

  Some problems I foresee:

  - With email, you should always [according to standards documents, anyway]
    have a pretty good idea of what kind of data you're being handed. 
    Content-Type and other MIME headers make it easy enough to decypher what
    someone just sent you, but afaik, no IM protocols that support file
    transfer deal with this.  What's the correct way to handle a file with
    no meta data?

  - PGP; we can verify signatures, but security conscious users will want
    this done client-side - that means preserving the exact structure of the
    message somehow and then sending it on to them.  This doesn't play
    nicely with the idea of being able to receive one kind of message and
    send it off as another kind.

but I would like to discuss it and other patches like it.  Not to pick 
on bob here; there isn't really a policy on avoiding bloat in Twisted, 
so it can't be said that this is a violation of anything in particular. 
  I just think we need one.

First, my question is: do we have more than one or two users who 
actually need this functionality?  If it's a real, present need for a 
wide variety of applications, then much of this criticism does not 
apply.

Addition of stuff like this strikes me as similar to the addition of 
complicated preference panels to GNOME to work around core usability 
problems, which only created a new usability problems.

This patch is a band-aid on an already crummy and huge interface 
(twisted.internet.app is nasty; ask anyone who has had to work on its 
internals) which makes it even crummier and huger.

Huger: it inflates the interface by one more potentially redundant 
class, so that we have that many more places to insert deprecation 
warnings when we refactor the whole mess into something usable.

Crummier:

"utility" patches like this will invariably fail to take edge cases 
into account well.  I wouldn't say it's immediately obvious how 
edge-cases *should* be taken into account, personally, but I would 
guess that half-changing the semantics of the ordering in case of 
failure is not the correct thing to do.

My concern is that some ill-thought-out parts of Twisted (twisted.cred, 
twisted.internet.app) will become calcified behind a wide and fragile 
interface that prevents any hope for refactoring.  So far, development 
on these kinds of problem areas has been fairly dynamic, because they 
have been kept small and simple.  However, the inevitable weight of 
history is already slowing down more improvement.  I would like to not 
increase that weight any more than necessary.

I'm using twisted's Perspective Broker for a generic turn based game engine,
and it works smoothly.  Using PB allows you to write your api almmost as if
networking wasn't involved, excepting only that you'll need to use "callRemote"
for client/server calls instead of normal method calling (and connect your
client/server of course).

The Perspective Broker section on this page was usefull to me:

Jp, I realize Twisted unittest is either slightly older than the standard,
or perhaps slightly evolved from it, but I'm not sure why you think 
assert_() shouldn't be used directly by TestCases.  According at least to 
http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/testcase-objects.html it's merely
a synonym for failUnless(), as all the other assertXxxx() variants are 
synonyms of their respective failXxxxx() methods.  I think it is intended
to be a perfectly valid exposed method.

Yes, sorry... my response was already obsolete before I posted it.
Shouldn't count so much on my (also obsolete) mail reader's threading
capabilities to tell me when I'd read all messages on this topic.

(By the way, I think there's actually a place for both forms of the
assertXxxx() and failUnlessXxxxx() methods.  Sometimes the logic
just seems clearer to write it (and read it) one way, or the other.  
Perhaps that's a sign of smelly programmer thinking, but all I can do 
is report on what I've experienced personally...)

Yeah, the problem is that the interface is sufficiently ill-specified 
and lacking in features that folks will depend upon the internals for 
complete semantics.  The goal is to have as few intermediary versions 
of the internal semantics before we arrive at something well-specified 
and good :).

If I knew exactly how much work it needed, then the work would probably 
have begun :).

However, cred is in an acceptable state at the moment.  Most of the 
cruddiness has to do with backwards-compatibility hacks to a 
significantly worse version of itself.  When these get removed (circa 
Twisted 1.1), there are still a few semantic holes that need to be 
filled, such as the real utility of MultiService, but all in all it 
works as-is.

It's in a much less bad state than twisted.internet.app, at least in my 
opinion ;)

Do we have more than two users that _know_ they need/want this 
functionality?  Probably not, yet.

Here's a use case.  Let's say you have some sort of service hierarchy 
that resembles a system startup.  The way Darwin does this is that it 
has plist files bundled with the actual "rc" scripts that determine 
which services get started and in what order by SystemStarter.  Here's 
an example plist file (in NeXT format, because XML is retarded) for the 
LDAP service:
{
   Description     = "LDAP";
   Provides        = ("LDAP");
   Requires        = ("Network Configuration", "DirectoryServices");
   OrderPreference = "None";
}

In this case, in order for LDAP to start, the services that provide 
Network Configuration and DirectoryServices must already be running.  
It doesn't care which ordering bucket it sits in (OrderPreference can 
be Last, First, etc.), and it provides LDAP functionality to other 
services that want it.

DependentMultiService is a very crude basis for such a mechanism, 
because I don't need that kind of functionality yet.  However, it does 
provide a pretty decent base class for a future Twisted "SystemStarter" 
equivalent... which we *should* want to have someday.

Thinking like this could potentially make things such as tying 
authorizers to pb services and whatnot easier, if they're done in a 
service collection manner rather than just tied to the same parent.  
However, as you said, app and cred are already nasty and need a major 
refactoring.

Basically, it's not at all obvious what you do if you have a failure in 
a collection of interdependent services.  On startup or shutdown, if 
one fails, you obviously aren't going to be able to say that whole 
collection is started or stopped properly, so I make the remainder of 
the running services shut down immediately.  The only difference in 
semantics is that once a failure happens, the service stopping is no 
longer chained (the rest of the running services get stopService called 
immediately).  It really depends on what kind of services you have to 
determine whether you want to try and chain this or not.. but in most 
cases, startService and stopService don't return deferreds anyways, and 
in even more cases, you don't expect them to fail.  I'll go ahead and 
add an __init__ option that lets you decide which behavior gets chosen 
in the case of a failure.

Also, the fact that I'm returning a deferred here either way means that 
it's probably possible that you could even set a timeout.. which is 
kind of cool, but I've said before that the Deferred timeout API can 
cause some issues (it can't actually make something NOT happen.. which 
is really unfortunate).  I really think there should be an API to 
cancel Deferreds, and the methods that return them should be refactored 
to respect a cancel whenever possible.

  I think I need this, but order is such a hard topic, I've mostly ignored
it and relied on luck to keep my app working instead of coming up with a
good solution.  I'm not entirely sure (and I won't be devoting time to the
project where it's needed in the near future) DependentMultiService solves
my use-case, but if not, something like it probably would.

As some of you know, I'm developing a Twisted application called Hep. 
Hep is a multiprotocol message server that lets users set up connections
to various messaging systems (currently: RSS, POP3, SMTP, Blogger API,
and local maildir storage) and then read/write to those connections
through various protocols (currently: POP3, SMTP, NNTP).  Hep also has a
web server with a basic web interface for managing things.

Anyhow, since I've been working on this project I've been thinking a lot
about abstraction layers for messages.  So here are some incomplete
late-night thoughts:

* First, I define 'message' very loosely: a short text communication
written by one person for one or more other persons to read.

* Formats, protocols, and storage are loosely coupled.  rfc822 is a
format for messages.  So is RSS.  So is HTML (if you want to look at it
that way), or plain .txt. SMTP, NNTP, IMAP, or POP3 can all be used to
transfer rfc822 messages.  HTTP is typically the protocol used to
transfer RSS and HTML.  You can store messages in plain directories,
specialized directory layouts like maildir, file formats like RSS and
mbox that support multiple messages, databases, etc.

* All types of messages, by definition, have a body (although it may be
left blank).

* Almost all messages can be looked at in terms of "from" and "to". 
Even personal-use text files on the local system.  Even web pages,
although the "from" might be unkown, and the "to" might be "anyone in
the world who happens to be interested in this"

* Most, but not all, message formats support the idea of a
title/subject.

* Messages can contain other messages.

* You can't rely on getting a (correct) mime-type along with the message
- I've had to resort to letting my format handlers try to figure out for
themselves whether they can handle a given file if the mime-type is
unknown.

* For messaging protocols, the basic operations are "scan" (and/or
"fetch"), "post", "edit", and "delete".  Fetch is almost universal,
although the way this works varies a lot from system to system.  My
messaging library currently has a single function that every protocol
supports, scan().  You run connection.scan(messageHandlerFunction), and
the connection will try to get whatever messages might be available
there, and run messageHandlerFunction on each message.  scan() returns a
deferred, which will be called back if the scan has completed, and there
won't be any more messages found unless scan() is called again. 
Although I haven't implemented it my idea has been that for
always-connected systems like IMAP and instant messaging, scan() would
continue to run until the connection was terminated.

* post() is pretty easy to abstract across various systems, and works
well for SMTP, IMAP, NNTP, various blog APIs, instant messaging, and
local message stores.  It even works with vanilla HTTP, sort of.

* So far I haven't put implemented edit() or delete() on anything except
local message stores, so no comments there.

* Folders and chat rooms are basically the same thing - a place where
messages are posted to and read from.

* I'm using URLs to describe places you can access messages.

Anyhow, I'm not sure what level of support for all this you want to have
in Twisted.  If you really wanted to go all out it's possible to create
a layer of abstraction that would let you read/write to a local mbox
file, a NNTP newsgroup, an RSS file accessed through HTTP, and a folder
full of text files, all using the same API.  That's the direction I'm
going in at the moment, but it's probably too wide a scope for the core
Twisted APIs.


If anybody here is interested in seeing my attempts at creating a system
that implements these kinds of ideas, you can check out the code from
CVS:

:pserver:anonymous at cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/hepserver

The two modules are "messaging" (the messaging abstraction layer, which
is usable on it's own - see examples/copymessages.py) and "hep".  If you
want to run Hep you'll also need the Lupy text indexer from divmod.org. 
You might also to read my weblog entries from last week at
http://www.fettig.net/.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] The Woven Way?
Message-ID: <uwuhx4wa9.fsf@yahoo.com>

First off, the cliche (but nonetheless genuine) thanks for the awesome set of tools!

Is there any way for a Woven resource script to retrieve the uri with which it was called, similar to passing arguments to a CGI script via the url?

Say I have a twisted server that I'd like to monitor via Woven pages.  One of the pages looks something like:

Port1  Up    Details...
Port2  Down  Details...
Port3  Up    Details...

where the "Details..." items are links to another Woven page.  If I were doing this with a CGI script, the links would contain something like href="details.rpy?port=1", or href="details.rpy?port=37", and details.rpy would grab the uri and generate the desired page.  I suspect I'm looking at this all wrong by thinking in terms of passing arguments via the url, but don't know what would be a more naturally Woven way to do this. Any guidance would be most appreciated.

Thanks,


Eric.

Ok, after more careful searching and discussion with Glyph I think we nailed
it. The fix we put in earlier wasn't being used when PB calls jelly, but only
when jelly was run by itself. I've added the necessary code (and a new unit
test). It should be fixed now. The clientBug/serverBug scripts you attached
to your earlier message now run without error for me.

Thanks for your patience, and for the great bug report. That test script was
exactly what we needed.

Note to other bug submitters: following Jasper's excellent example will
greatly improve the chances of getting your bug fixed quickly :).

YAGNI.

More specifically - maybe we will eventually need such a thing.  In the 
process of building a real "SystemStarter" equivalent, however, we may 
find that DependentMultiService actually isn't that useful, and we 
instead want to use some other intermediary dependency management 
strategy.

In a more optimistic case, we're merely maintaining an interface to an 
implementation detail that people shouldn't be using.  In a worse case, 
we have another twisted.python.observable on our hands - dead code that 
one or two things are using because we haven't had time to update them 
to use TwistedStarter instead.

In fact, I think that TwistedStarter sounds like a good idea - it 
provides a high-level interface to some functionality that may be 
tricky to implement correctly.  If you would go all the way and 
implement that I would probably be less unhappy than if this stayed in 
:-).

However, this is just an advice, not an "MDFL pronouncement" - the 
final call on that module is Itamar's, and if he's not going to stop 
you checking it in, then I'll concede.  I was mainly using this as an 
example, not as a particularly egregious thing that really needs to go. 
  I want Twisted developers to consider things like continuing 
maintenance before checking things in.

Your analogy is broken. If you have some code that needs
DependantMultiService, then you can check in DependantMultiService at
the same time as your code. If it's only application-code (i.e., an
application that is not contributed to Twisted) that needs it, leave
it in your application for now.

Of course, maybe there can be exceptions to this occasionally, but I
think any exceptions need to be thought about very hard, for the
reasons Glyph pointed out.

Also, sandbox is appropriate for such stuff. e.g., flow.py.

  Does Ldaptor use NNTP?  I remember thinking "I'll do pipelining when

IIRC, the module is called pyPgSQL.PgSQL.. I think you want this:

dbpool = adbapi.ConnectionPool("pyPgSQL.PgSQL", host='localhost',

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Forcing adapter re-registration (patch)
Message-ID: <20030415110038.GH27721@mumak.net>


Woven code uses registerAdapter alot. When developing Woven code, it's
extremely handy to have a couple of 'rebuild' calls in your RPY. (If these
aren't there, the web server must be restarted for code canges to take effect)

However, registerAdapter and rebuild don't play nicely together. On a rebuild,
registerAdapter tries to re-register stuff, and throws an exception. 

Below is a patch that adds an optional keyword parameter 'force' to the
registerAdapter method. If force is set to a true value, registerAdapter should
happily re-register stuff. Otherwise, the current behaviour holds.

The tests work, and I'll quite happily commit if no-one has any problems.

cheers,
jml

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Multiple simultaneous SelectReactors?
Message-ID: <3E9B6206.D3C1C701@engcorp.com>

There appear to be serious problems in several areas of twisted.internet
if one tries to create multiple SelectReactors to use at the same time.

Why would one want to?  For acceptance testing, when it can be desirable 
that the code under test run in the same process as the test code, but
it's not appropriate to share the Reactor.

I'm working on a few fixes, some of which appear to be latent bugs of
various kinds, but I'm still extremely new at Twisted and won't 
immediately be able to provide nice patches and such.

For now, I mainly have these questions:

1. Is Twisted expected to support this in principle, if not currently
in practice?

2. Are the globals "reads" and "writes" that are used in 
twisted.internet.default there solely for optimization purposes, or is
there some more nefarious purpose?  Is it considered absolutely critical
that this optimization is in place?  (If so, it probably makes it 
impossible to fix this limitation of Twisted.)

3. Is it well-known that the abstract.FileDescriptor class does a quiet
little fallback to the global reactor if you don't pass it a reactor reference, 
and that Port fails to pass in its own reactor reference when it creates
a Server object in doRead()?

We've strung together a variety of little changes in the process of 
figuring this out.  Once we're more confident of what we're doing,
I'd be happy to supply the fixes, but I'm not going to waste my time
if everyone thinks SelectReactor.doSelect() absolutely must do those
optimizations.

Also note: I'm working on the most recent released version, not CVS.
The slightest hint that this stuff is significantly changed in CVS 
will send me there, but until now we weren't confident enough with
Twisted to work from unreleased code.  (Actually, attempting to 
resolve this has slightly lowered my confidence in Twisted, but 
only just a bit.)

I think you're approaching this the wrong way.

Rather than forcing it in a particular place in the code, you want to 
force it at a particular time; i.e. when a module is being rebuilt.

Could you instead have a module flag "allowDuplicates" which would be 
set by rebuild and unset when it was finished?

That would be putting it mildly.

I'm aware of this use-case, but it was difficult to write for a variety 
of reasons.  History plays a large role in Twisted's, um, history.  We 
try very hard to support backwards compatibility for many versions, so 
that early adopters do not get burned by quicksand interfaces, and 
sometimes a bit of ugliness results.  This is one of those cases.

As someone new to Twisted, your time would probably be better spent 
coding your acceptance tests to use spawnProcess and actually invoking 
different Python processes for the different components.  It's 
relatively easy to communicate between them once this is done.

> 1. Is Twisted expected to support this in principle, if not currently
> in practice?

Yes.  If you read the CVS logs, you'll notice a trend that more things 
these days take a "reactor" argument than they used to.  We have been 
slowly refactoring towards this for a while.

I would prefer that this optimization remain in place (changes to code 
this far down into the core is a severe problem), but it wasn't 
originally an optimization.  It's present there as a 
backwards-compatibility hack for twisted.internet.main, which is so 
deprecated that you will get sick and die if you even look at it.  It 
can probably be changed at this point.

Yes.  Trust me, this was the best compromise at the time :-).

I would be happier with a simple subclass that was 
slightly-slower-but-multiple-reactor-capable.  However, if you were to 
supply a patch that actually caught all these nuances and fixed them in 
a sensible way, I seriously doubt I would turn it down if you undid a 
tiny (and dubious) optimization :).

The unreleased code doesn't fix this in particular, but it does include 
a LOT of bug fixes.  We are currently struggling to get a release out, 
thanks to the heroic efforts of Kevin Turner.  Hopefully it won't be 
much longer now :).

Sorry to bother you again but I don't understand how to link a QueryIterator
with "standart" consumer... :(

even with a simple exemple, I can't have QueryIterator to work :


  dbpool = adbapi.ConnectionPool("MySQLdb",
                                host=host,
                                db='MYDB',
                                user='USER',
                                passwd='PASS')
  sql = """SELECT nom FROM dbo_questionnaire limit 0,50""" 
  queryIt = QueryIterator(dbpool, sql)

  def res(x): print "Results : ", x
  from twisted.internet import reactor
  f = flow.DeferredFlow(queryIt)
  f.addCallback(res)
  reactor.callLater(2,reactor.stop)
  reactor.run()

Just give me this ouput :

Results : []


Thank you !

sorry, this was a connexion problem. NTL, I can't use QueryIterator with a
consumer. I need a little more help, flow isn't easy to use if you aren't
familiar with deferred, reactors, generators, etc.

This is weird, any exception is raised (try to change a function name in
a consumer).

Thank you..... I 've tried all the day to make it work, but I didn't
succeed :(

But the code above blocks and never exits.

Yes, this works (I've found it this morning). But it's still hard to use
with several producers and consumers.

A little howto would greatly help :)
I can help you, if I understand every thing someday !

Thank you again for your help

This isn't a clear policy.  The primary reason... Twisted is
a framework, and not an application (right?).  Therefore, 
applications shouldn't be part of Twisted (even if they were 
contributed).  So, it really is a chicken and egg.

Perhaps a better policy, if Glyph agrees, then it is in, 
otherwise the necessary conditions for a module to be
added to twisted.* are:
   
   1. the module has three or more end-user applications, from
      at least two different authors, where one of the applications
      (how ever trivial) must be open source so that it's usefulness
      can be highlighted; and

   2. the module complies with the coding standard, and comes
      with a complete coverage test suite; and

   3. the module comes with a documentation and tutorial so
      that it's usage can be understood by others; and

   4.  the module has at least two additional (committer)
       sponsors who think that it is useful to Twisted; and

   5.  the module 'floats' around on the list for at least
       a month or so so that enough people can 'chime' in
       any objections, or so that Glyph can register a veto.


Anyway, it's kinda strict, but it would make for a good basis
for the kind of quality level that we should probably have for
new modules.

But this still doesn't solve the 'bootstrap' issue, that is,
unless the module is checked into CVS, and the documentation
is clearly available, it makes it *very* hard to find users,
and thus to meet the first requirement.

| Of course, maybe there can be exceptions to this occasionally, but I
| think any exceptions need to be thought about very hard, for the
| reasons Glyph pointed out.
| 
| Also, sandbox is appropriate for such stuff. e.g., flow.py.

Yes.  I've found that the sandbox is a great place for this,
as the code isn't officially part of twisted; but yet is in
the CVS and distributed.  

...

However, there are problems with the 'Sandbox'.  The flow.py
file is really three items:

  1.  A new flow.py file in twisted.python
  2.  A small addition to twisted.internet.defer
  3.  A small addition to twisted.enterprise.adbapi
  4.  A small addition to twisted.python.compat (already applied)

So, I'd like to see the 'Sandbox' restructured in such
a way that it takes on a 'recursive diff' shape...

  Twisted/sandbox/flow/twisted/python/flow.py
  Twisted/sandbox/flow/twisted/internet/defer.py.diff
  Twisted/sandbox/flow/twisted/enterprise/adbapi.py.difff
  Twisted/sandbox/flow/test/test_flow.py
  Twisted/sandbox/flow/doc/howto/flow.html

And then having a 'make apply_flow' which will apply the
patches and copy over what would be the result when 
adding flow to the new tree.   In this way people can go
into the sandbox and 'enable' any new additions that they
want.  

I know it's not great, but it would then be clear to 
everyone what a given proposal is.  Most modules in 
the future may not be a simple file... flow isn't, 
despite it's very small size.

Best,

Clark

The error handling is not a strong point of flow.py yet, but
it eventually will be.   Sorry about my last example, you
can't use QueryIterator or ThreadedIterator without using
the reactor... my bad ;)

  dbpool = adbapi.ConnectionPool("MySQLdb",
                                host=host,
                                db='MYDB',

Clark,

I think your policy suggestion is a good one.  I don't have an 
immediate yea or nay, but I'm thinking about it.  As to one of the 
things you asked, though:

On Tuesday, April 15, 2003, at 03:26 PM, Clark C. Evans wrote:

> (right?).

Yes, but then, the things that we characterize as "applications" these 
days are really frameworks.

In the ideal world, Twisted would start up and take over all 
UNIX-networking-y services that you ask it to; a webserver, a mail 
server (POP and SMTP), an IRC server, a rendezvous client and server, 
and a generic PB port that would provide access to all this 
functionality through a better protocol.

Applications would then hook into this environment and provide either 
enhanced versions of infrastructure - say, database-backed message 
storage rather than maildirs - or more frequently, domain objects that 
would do things completely unrelated to infrastructure.  For example, a 
message board, a chatterbot, a knowledge management system, etc.  These 
applications would then hook multiple URIs.  A chatterbot might have an 
IRC nickname as well as an email address, and would respond similarly 
(but not identically) to either.

By having the actual protocols taken over by the infrastructure like 
this, multiple applications (some of them running in different OS-level 
protection domains) can all talk to the same core services at once.  
Two chatterbot instances owned by different users might even converse 
with each other over the core infrastructure layer, either on the same 
host or on different hosts.

The existing codebase obviously doesn't implement terribly much of 
this, but you can see some of it.  Some people consider a web-server an 
"application", but 'mktap web' starts up and serves web pages.  'mktap 
words' starts a chat server.  'im' starts a chat client.  Over time 
these will become more unified and integrated.

To put it simply, "yes, Twisted is a framework, which means it's an 
application".

I solved the problem. It was a missing import (QueryIterator). But any
exception is raised when using flow. It's too hard to debug, even for few

Joe,

Count me in! I've been looking everywhere for code and a tutorial like 
this, so I would very much appreciate a gander at your code.

I am building an application on top of a socket server that speaks 
Flash-friendly XML. Even with my minimal knowledge of Twisted I have 
built a working example on top of the simple echo server. I have a 
nagging feeling that I should be looking at PB instead.

The next step is to add persistence with database calls. Working in a 
strict asynchronous framework is all new to me. But exciting!

Thanks for all the good work,

Doug Goodwin

Hi all,

First of all I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Erik Bakker and i'm a
student at the university of Twente in the Netherlands. I'm working on a
project, in which we would like to use Twisted-python. We are making a
distributed 3D world using OpenGL in python. And we like to use Twisted for
the distribution. We don't need to distribute lots of data, in fact we only
need to distribute the 3D camera position (and only if the 3D camera
changes on input from the user). We would like to broadcast the camera
position to all clients but how is the big question. I can't find anything
in the documentation about broadcasting (except that it is possible:). Now
was our idea that it should be possible with the module UDP from the
internet package, but we can't get it to work.
Now my questions are if it is possible to broadcast using twisted and how.
I'm a bit a newbie in Twisted (yet;-) anybody got any idea's, examples?

Many thanks in advance!

Erik Bakker

It's actually an API-compatible (or near enough) re-implementation, called
Trial.

There is fledgling Multicast UDP support in Twisted, but I don't think 
anyone has really tried to use it yet.  Are all clients expected to be 
on the same subnet?  If not, multicast or broadcast is probably not 
going to be appropriate.

As far as implementation goes, take a look at the UDP howto, and 
echoclient_udp.py and echoserv_udp.py in doc/examples.  I haven't used 
UDP since the API for using UDP changed, so I can't really help you any 
more than that.

Ok.  I define an Application as a service which provides or
responds to specific user-level content.   Those software
components which can be shared by more than one application
are canidates for inclusion into Twisted.

Right.  Are these applications considered part of Twisted?  For
instance, I can picture an 'Baseball Stat' application which
uses an IRC bot, plus a HTTP interface, etc.   

For contrast, let's say that a IMAP implementation which is part
of Twisted comes with a maildir backend; but then, someone provides
a generic database back end, a layer which maps database structures
onto IMAP requests.  As long as it is 'generic', in that it can work
with more than one set of user content (and thus possibly different
table structures, or with a single but generic table structure),
then I'd consider the database back end Infrastructure.

However, if this database backend maps only to one set of tables,
perhaps specific to a problem domain, I'd consider it part of
the Application.

So, the question is, when does a software component which is 
part of an Application become a canidate for inclusion into
Twisted... I'd say, when it is used by 3 or more Applications,
one of which is open source (which may be trivial, but is used
as an example)

| By having the actual protocols taken over by the infrastructure like

| "application", but 'mktap web' starts up and serves web pages.  'mktap 
| words' starts a chat server.  'im' starts a chat client.  Over time 
| these will become more unified and integrated.

Ok.  I don't really consider the generic web server as an Application,
IMHO, Apache is *not* an application.  Apache plus a content directory
and a given configuration file is an Application.  In this respect,
the configuration of the Webserver is the 'program'.

| To put it simply, "yes, Twisted is a framework, which means it's an 
| application".

A line has to be drawn, I like the idea of calling the stuff outside 
Twisted the Application.  If you define Twisted as an Application, 
then we just need another name for what is outside the line.  I'd
rather not find another name... and the purpose of this discussion
is to draw a distinction for what is in and what is not in Twisted.

For instance, a particular IRC chat client (/w a user interface)
should not be part of Twisted, as it will probably include lots
of specific assumptions as to how a given user would chat.  However,
just about everything that a chat client needs could be a 
canidate for Twisted.

Perhaps what we need is a 'apps' directory in the top level
of Twisted directory (but not in the twisted.* package) where
people can drop in Applications which they would like to share
with the community; but are not necessarly maintained by
the Twisted Community.  

Best,

Clark

Or at least a set of links on the webpage that are more prevalent and 
better maintained than the success stories..  And then there's the 
hybrid of the two, where a sourceforge-like facility could (eventually) 
be provided to open source Twisted applications... but god knows that's 
a pain in the ass to setup.

Maybe when Twisted can host svn, has its own wiki and the bugtracker 
gets better.. who knows?  It'd certainly be a damn good demonstration 
of Twisted if it could run nearly the whole intranet (mail, web, dns, 
bug tracking, source code management, forums, wiki, instant messaging, 
ldap, etc.) of a software development company "out of the box".  I'd 
sure as hell use it, our exim + cyrus + openldap + ldapdns + apache + 
cvs + gforge... etc... setup is a real pain in my ass.

Message-ID: <1050526823.30719.591.camel@lothlorien>

In the webware-sandbox CVS (webware-sandbox.sf.net), in
Sandbox.ianbicking.TwistedWebware, I've put some code to run Webware
under Twisted.  This mostly subsumes the Webware AppServer, with Twisted
handling the threads and sending requests directly to
Application.dispatchRawRequest.

There's certainly some cludges.  There's a minor change to
MiscUtils.Funcs.hostName to accomodate Twisted, so the CVS version of
that file is required.

It's an experiment, because it doesn't actually offer anything we don't
have already.  It would be more interesting if we can use some of the
other protocols that Twisted supports.  I don't yet know how to do that
in Twisted, though.

The flow module should be much better in 'debug' land now
as I think I'm capturing exceptions correctly.  By default,
the DeferredFlow object catches exceptions and uses 
deferred's errback.    It also allows you to pass a 
callable which creates a generator, in case you
forget to use () to invoke.  

If you want the old behavior (compatible with the default
behavior of DeferredList) then use failureAsResult to 
treat failure objects the same as any other result,
returning a list of results to the callback.  

Best,

I have been trying to get the examples in section 2.4 of the HOWTO to work. It

I had problems with the examples in section 2.4.3 and 2.5 as well. In section 
2.5 the telnet localhost 4040 command returned a different module location 
instead of twisted.protocols.telnet.ShellFactory and when I ran dir(__main__) 
the list of names did not come close to matching what was in the example. No

I like Interface inheritance, and I don't think anyone has really objected to
it yet.

Maybe you were thinking of the objections to _inheriting of Interfaces_ of
superclasses?

I have :-).

The problem is that currently, it doesn't do what you think.  What most 
people want an interface inheritance to do is make

     class IFoo(Interface): pass
     class IBar(IFoo): pass
     class Bar:
         __implements__ = IBar

be more or less equivalent to

     class IFoo(Interface): pass
     class IBar(Interface): pass
     class Bar:
         __implements__ = IFoo, IBar

Currently this does _not_ happen, because

Does this "DWIM" in Zope?  I have been hesitant to make 
python.components handle it this way, firstly because we didn't realize 
it at first and so it would now be a change in semantics, and secondly 
because it's not clear what effect this would have on registerAdapter.  
Would

     registerAdapter(Bar, Baz, IBar)

also register an adapter for Baz for IFoo?  Why or why not?  What if a 
different adapter was already registered?  I could see that taking 
interface inheritance into account here could be sometimes convenient, 
but it could also be sometimes wrong.  I really have no idea what the 
right answer is, and so leaving it "inconvenient but simple" was easier 
for the time being.

Alex and I have proposed a completely different alternative
to Interfaces, which I think is more Pythonic, and perhaps
may be more generally useful.  I'm not a big fan of Zope's
approach.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] feedback requested -- flow.py goes beta
Message-ID: <20030417160957.GA31818@doublegemini.com>

Abstract: >

   The flow module implements cooperative multi-tasking using
   iterators (easily created with generators) and Twisted's 
   event reactor.   The flow module also includes support for
   incrementally returning query results from Twisted's 
   database connection pool.  While this module does _not_ 
   require generators (a python v2.2 feature), applications 
   of the module are best demonstrated with generators.

Status: >

   The flow module (flow.py) is currently checked into CVS in
   the sandbox directory.  It is unlikely that any large 
   changes to the module will happen.   The documentation 
   is partial, but currently in development.

   General feedback from the Twisted Community is requested.
  
Deployment: >

   If flow was accepted into twisted, I was thinking 
   of spreading its functionality over several files.
   
   1.  Adding a base implementation module, twisted.python.flow,
       which only depends upon other items in twisted.python

   2.  Adding a (fairly small) Flow class to 
       twisted.internet.defer which takes the base
       implementation and uses the reactor and inherits
       from Deferrred.

   3.  Adding a ThreadedIterator class to twisted.internet.threads
       which depends upon twisted.internet.reactor and 
       twisted.python.*
  
   4.  Adding a (fairly small) QueryIterator class to 
       twisted.enterprise.adbapi which depends primarly 
       on ThreadedIterator, but provides for query 
       functionality from a ConnectionPool

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Problem with twisted.web log files
Message-ID: <20030417143134.GC2096@polynode.com>

I'm seeing some strange behavior from twisted.web.

After running "mktap web --logfile=web.log ; twistd -nf web.tap", I get the
following traceback:

AssertionError

This does _not_ happen, however, if I run "mktap web --logfile=./web.log"

This problem has only surfaced recently, although I can't say precisely how
long ago.  I am using Twisted out of CVS.

  In this vein, what is the policy on things that are now in CVS but that
are no longer used by anything?

  I know this is trickier, because apps might be relying on them, but we've
got some *really* obscure stuff :)

  For example, twisted.python.reflect.{Settable,Promise,Summer} - completely
unused, except for their tests.

  It'd be nice if we could lose some of this baggage - not right away, but
maybe start with some deprecations now?

Message-ID: <200304172119.44319.jon@totient.demon.co.uk>

When building twisted 1.0.3 on solaris using the sun 'cc' compiler, several of the c extension modules fail because 
of the prescence of '//' for a comment in the code. 

grep -n "\/\/" `find . -name "*.c" -print`

./twisted/internet/cReactor/cDelayedCall.c:126:    // self.time += secondsLater
./twisted/internet/cReactor/cDelayedCall.c:170:    // self.time = time() + secondsFromNow
./twisted/internet/cReactor/cReactorTCP.c:159:    char buf[3*20+3+1+100]; // for good measure
./twisted/internet/cReactor/cReactorTime.c:93:        return NULL; // TODO: set exception?
./twisted/internet/cReactor/cReactorTime.c:125:    //return cDelayedCall_cancel(call, NULL);



please can these be replaced with the /* */ to keep the compiler happy?
I'd fix it myself but dont have CVS access.

I think the gnu compiler is more forgiving, unfortunately solaris cc is not.

cheers

Subject: [Twisted-Python] blocking question
Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.44.0304172305520.3390-100000@rac1.wam.umd.edu>

Hey everyone, newbie question:
Are there any Python/Twisted idioms for doing blocking? More specifically,
in a client I have a method to send a query to the server and another
method that gets called when the query is answered. Is there an easy way
to say "send the query then wait x seconds for it to return in this
function"?
It seems like blocking is taboo in twisted and if anyone has an
alternative I'd be glad to hear it. I guess I could do this
asynchronically but it would be a pain I think.
Thanks,
Konrad Rokicki

  Like this, probably:

    d = queryFunction()
    d.setTimeout(x)
    d.addCallbacks(handleAnswer, queryTimedOut)
    reactor.run()

  It's not a taboo, it's just not done ;)

This is what Deferreds are for.  Your client should look something like
this:

    from twisted.internet.defer import Deferred
    from twisted.protocols.basic import LineReceiver
    
    class MyClient(LineReceiver):
        """A very simple protocol that sends one line 'queries', and
        receives one line answers in response.  An answer that startswith
        'Result:' is considered a successful response; anything else is an
        error response."""
        
        def sendQuery(queryString):
            self.sendLine(queryString)
            self.queryDeferred = Deferred()
            return queryDeferred
    
        def lineReceived(line):
            if line.startswith('Result:'):
                self.queryDeferred.callback(line[7:])
            else:
                self.queryDeferred.errback(line)
            self.queryDeferred = None


This is obviously a rather stupid protocol.
    
Then, to perform a query:

    # Assume we've already got a connected MyClient instance in the variable
    # 'myclient'.
    
    # Define a callback and an errback.
    def printResult(result, query):
        print 'Result of query %r is: %r' % (query, result)

    def printFailure(failure, query):
        print 'Query %r failed:' % query
        failure.printTraceback()

    # Send the query
    query = 'query string'
    deferred = myclient.sendQuery(query)

    # Set a timeout
    deferred.setTimeout(10)

    # Attach callback/errback to handle the result
    deferred.addCallback(printResult, query)
    deferred.addErrback(printResult, query)
    
    
See http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/defer for more details on using
Deferreds.  See also the "Writing a Server" and "Writing a Client" howtos.
This is pretty basic Twisted stuff, so the existing docs cover it pretty
well.

-Andrew.

  So, there's maybe half a dozen interfaces in twisted.internet.interfaces
that inherit from something other than component.Interface.  Shall I go
ahead and clean these up?

Well, as far as I know, cReactor doesn't really work yet.. and the 
other C extensions don't exhibit this issue.  I'm sure it'll get fixed 
by the time cReactor is actually supposed to work, though :)

Here's my feedback Clark :

I'm testing flow currently. The results I've got with it are wonderful. And
I couldn't do anything without your documentation. This is an important
part of flow. Maybe we should provide a concreate exemple (like Twisted
Quotes) to explain it ?

A little more tests, and flow would be considered as " stable ". I really
hope to see it in Twisted 1.0.5.

I have one question : why did you delete the addBranch method ?

I see the point of Merge (merging 2 or more flows), but what is its opposite
? I mean, if you look at this :

DS1 ----> BLOC1 ---+
                             |
DS2 ----> BLOC2 ---+---- BLOC3 -----> DS3

DS1 and DS2 point the same server, the same db, and the same table. Why use
too connexions instead of one like above ?


DS   ----> BLOC1 ---+
       |                      |
        ----> BLOC2 ---+---- BLOC3 -----> DS3

Maybe it's already on your todo list !? :)

thank you

Detailled information about mappings:

(this is the previous schema)

DS   ----> BLOC1 ---+
       |                      |
        ----> BLOC2 ---+---- BLOC3 -----> DS3

In this exemple, DS has the role to provide data. For that, I use a query.
Let's say:

"Select field1, field2, field3, field4 from MYTABLE"

all field are numerical values.

BLOC1 has to work with field1 and field2
whereas BLOC2 has to work with field3 and field4.

I can split the datasource in 2 connexions. But this a really simple
exemple. If I have 100 BLOCS after the datasources, I may have 100
connexions * Number of Users. Crash ! :)

Am I clearer ?

Message-ID: <20030418150231.GB34406@doublegemini.com>

I've got a user interface question to ask... there are several user
interface improvements possible in flow's operation, here are the 
options:

currently:

  producer = flow.wrap([1,2,3])
  while 1:
      yield producer
      res = producer.getResult() 
      // handle success

  # or, if you wish to handle failures...

  producer = flow.wrap([1,2,3])
  while 1:
      yield producer
      if producer.stop: break
      if producer.isFailure:
          fail = producer.result
          // handle failure
      else:
          res = producer.result
          // handle success
      
We can reduce one line of code by making wrap return
an iterator... which always returns iself.   Thus, the
creation+while loop can be collapsed into a single 
for line.  Unfortunately, this isn't all that intutive
since the item being looped over isn't the result

   for producer in flow.wrap([1,2,3]):
        # same as above, use either form

Another option, which uses for construct,

   producer = flow.wrap([1,2,3])
   yield producer
   for result in producer:
       // handle success
       yield producer

   producer = flow.wrap([1,2,3], raiseFailures = 0)
   yield producer
   for result in producer:
       if producer.isFailure:
           // handle failure
       else:
           // handle success
       yield producer

I'm not sure if this is better... but it does
use the for loop correctly.   There is a variant
which could save one line of code in the yield...

   # done once at the top of the file
   import flow
   flow = flow.Flow()   # create a 'global' flow object


   # done elsewhere...

       yield flow.wrap([1,2,3])
       for result in flow:
           // handle success
           yield flow

This example keeps the 'producer' in a sort-of global
variable so it can be reused.   If you had more than
one producer, you'd have to fall-back on the previous
mechanism.  But for items with a single flow, this
perhaps could be useful.  I don't know, I haven't thought
it through very much.

Another advantage of this second form, is that producer
could sprout a 'peek' method to look at the next result...
but a problem of this method is that each wrapped producer
won't release the current value till the next one is
acquired (or the end of the iteration).   This could be
a problem.. I don't know.

Is Glyph's Deferred talk from PyCon online yet?  That might also be 
useful.

krad - You should've just gone to PyCon man, it was right in DC at GWU 
and there were god knows how many talks about various pieces of Twisted.

The only time threads are used in Twisted is if an API that only 
provides a blocking interface must be used.. for example, 
twisted.enterprise uses a threadpool to dispatch queries to DBAPI 
compliant databases, since DBAPI is synchronous and blocking.  The only 
other way around this is to have a pool of worker processes instead of 
worker threads, but you don't really have anything to gain with this 
approach b/c it uses more memory/resources and IPC is slower than 
thread communication.

But yeah, what you want to do is definitely the kind of thing that you 
should be using Deferreds for.. Also, due to the chaining behavior, you 
can do something practical like this:

from twisted.web import microdom, client
# Start webpage fetch
d = client.getPage('http://example.com/somewebpage.html')
# If webpage fetch takes more than aFewSeconds, raise error
d.setTimeout(aFewSeconds)
# Take the web fetch result, and parse it into a DOM tree
# equivalent to saying: microdom.parseString(webFetchResult, 
beExtremelyLenient=1)
d.addCallback(microdom.parseString, beExtremelyLenient=1)
# this will get triggered if the timeout happens, or if there's a parse 
error
# however, with beExtremelyLenient, there usually won't be one.. it can 
parse some f'ed up html
d.addErrback(yourTimeoutOrParseErrorHandler)
# If everything goes OK, or if for some reason 
yourTimeoutOrParseErrorHandler returns a non-Failure result
# call yourPageHandlerThatUnderstandsDOMTrees(result)
# because microdom.parseString was called on the result, it is now a 
DOM tree instead of a string
d.addCallback(yourPageHandlerThatUnderstandsDOMTrees)

Another convenient thing about deferreds is that if the result of some 
callback is a deferred, then it will automagically be chained as 
well... for example, if yourPageHandlerThatUnderstandsDOMTrees wants to 
pass a fetched URL to the next callback handler, then all it has to do 
is return client.getPage(someURL) and the next handler will receive the 
result of that request, not the deferred instance for that request.

Message-ID: <20030418180733.19039.qmail@green.zadka.com>

Summary:
In PHP 4.3, /usr/bin/php4 is not CGI compatible. Twisted assumes it is.
Currently, the current version in Debian is 4.2, which is why is was not
a problem for most of the core Twisted developers. Others, more "edgy",
operating systems like Gentoo have already begun to feel the repercussions.
I talked to Adam Conrad (infinity on Freenode), who is the Debian PHP
maintainer, about this issu, and relayed his thoughts to glyph.
We actually do need to solve this problem.

Following are the detailed conversation transcripts, mildly edited by
me for formatting.

[re 4.3, on #debian-devel]
<_moshez> but my understanding is that now the default binary thinks it is not a CGI
<_moshez> so doesn't give CGI headers by default
<_moshez> and you need to build with magic flags to force the binary to give CGI headers.
<_moshez> now, when Twisted runs /usr/bin/php <php script>, *it really wants those headers*
<infinity> Twisted should be running /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php4
<_moshez> infinity: does /u/l/c-b/p4-cgi exist in all 4 versions?
<infinity> "All 4"?
<_moshez> infinity: yes. 4.2.xs
<infinity> Oh.  Yes.
<infinity> It exists all the way back to potato's 4.0.3
<infinity> _moshez : Various dists may package it differently, so if this an upstream thing, I'm not sure how best to deal with it.  But in Debian, it always has been, and always will be in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
<_moshez> infinity: I'll see what my upstream thinks, and if necessary I'll change it in my scripts
<_moshez> infinity: the important thing for me is to be woody-compatible
<infinity> _moshez : In fact, with 4.3, /usr/bin/php{,4} will be even less
+CGI-compatible than it is now, so make sure to use the CGI one. :)
<_moshez> infinity: I know that :)
<_moshez> infinity: this is why I wanted this cleared before 4.3 :)
<infinity> _moshez : Well, if this is for an httpd, a suggests might be nice,
<_moshez> infinity: I may use Suggests: in twisted-web, then.

[on #twisted]
<_moshez> glyph: <infinity> Twisted should be running /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php4
<_moshez> glyph: this is only guaranteed to be the location for Debian, though
<_moshez> glyph: I can deal with it in my scripts, or we can change it upstream
+then.  (I wish Enhances worked, I'd use it all over)
* _moshez notes nobody commented yet on his ITP
<glyph> _moshez: If you need to change it, upstream should have a way to configure it.  I imagine this is sufficiently variable that it should be an argument to mktap web
<_moshez> glyph: *you're* upstream
<_moshez> glyph: whatever you decide is fine by me...
<glyph> _moshez: I'm not going to fix PHP scripting right now, I do have more valuable things to be doing with my time :)
<glyph> _moshez: but that's what I recommend the solution to be.
<_moshez> glyph: if radix decides it's not worth his time, he should decide to either "leave as is" or "change to Debian default"
<_moshez> glyph: either of those would satisfy me
<glyph> _moshez: okay
<glyph> _moshez: could you write about this to the list, actually?
<glyph> _moshez: I think that we should have the issue talked about there, good raw material for a FAQ

I did a little bit of research into the issue yesterday, when someone 
asked on IRC.. basically what happened is that PHP now has two types of 
executables.  Unfortunately, the one that goes into /usr/bin is to be 
used to write actual PHP applications in -- under NO circumstance will 
these PHP binaries will print headers, regardless of argv.  The other 
one is to be used from cgi-bin.  The other binary, which may or may not 
exist, WILL print headers by default, but can suppress them if -q is on 
the argv.

IMHO, this is *retarded* and the PHP developers should be smacked 
upside the head for this.  Why not add a flag that ALLOWS headers to be 
printed?  At most, it scrapes some modicum of support code out of the 
binary, and 4 CPU cycles out of the option parsing.. what are they 
smoking?  Why does PHP need TWO binaries?  Couldn't they have just made 
the commandline one have a different name, symlink to the cgi binary, 
and have the cgi binary check argv[0] to see if it should assume -q or 
not?!?

Ok.  Thanks to extrepum's suggestions, flow can now use the
for loop.  Also, it handles exceptions in a cleaner way.  
For more details, see

   http://clarkevans.com/flow.html

flow.py, test_flow.py, and flow.html are currently 
checked into the Twisted CVS.

Hey, you broke my code!  Fortunately, you did it after the release
candidate, so I don't have to kill you.  Sorry I didn't have a unit test
in for it before, I do now (test_util.GetPasswordTest).  The behaviour I
was depending on *was* fully specified by the docstring though, which
you blatantly changed.

I can understand why for conch you would want a way of grabbing a
password from the terminal while leaving stdin undisturbed, but that's
not what this function did.  It allowed for a password to be passed in
to stdin so that scripts could set passwords without doing it on the
command line, because command line arguments show up in the process
table which is way too public on many systems.

I'm going to revert your change to python.util, please feel free to add
this functionality in another way (perhaps with a new function or
parameter) that does not break documented behaviour.

Thanks,

 - Kevin

Speaking of PHP support, are there any plans for FastCGI?  Seeing at least a
10x performance increase in PHP would be nice.

#
# Why flow?
#
#   The flow module provides a mechanism for delivering incremental
#   results and performing long computations in a manner which 
#   cooperates with other simoutaneous requests.
#
#   In this example are two data sources, one of which simulates
#   a long-computation which is made to cooperate with other 
#   requests, and the other which blocks, perhaps simulating a 
#   database result that delivers content in small chunks as it 
#   pages through the query results.
#
#   Using these two data sources is a simple HTML web page,
#   which weaves the data together onto a single output
#   stream, via request.write  
#
# Why not Deferreds?
#
#   One could use deferreds, however, in the first, cooperative
#   example, one would really have to use a thread or break the
#   computation down into very small deferred chunks (where one
#   really isn't necessary with the flow module).   And, in the
#   second, either you'd need a deferred for each row (or chunk
#   of rows), or the results could not be incrementally delivered.  
#   And, further, the HTML page generation would have to be broken
#   up into several 'stages' which were executed after each
#   other.   Furthermore, if more than one 'database' query
#   was to be used, the deferreds from them would have to
#   be synconized; or, you could not execute the queries
#   in parallel (one on a different database node, for 
#   example).  In any case, I don't think it'd be as 
#   pretty as this...  or am I missing something?

It shouldn't be too hard to write if you're interested in it.
Read the twisted/web/twcgi.py code to see how all of this is done
now. If you do write, we may integrate it into Twisted -- but
note that Twisted works just fine with 3rd party Resources and modules.
Most of the Twisted do not use CGI enough that this become a problem.

If we are going to sit around talking about everything for which this 
is true, we could be talking about PHP for a long, long time :).  
Thanks to those of you who did the research to get this working again.  
It's unnerving that the behavior of these versions is different, 
however, if we're going to have to start inserting options about which 
binary to use, FastCGI support, et. al. for PHP, perhaps we should have 
a --with-php=... option for mktap web?  Debian can provide a sensible, 
working default, but I have a feeling that other installations 
(/usr/local/bin seems popular for PHP users, especially if they *were* 
using apache and are *now* using Twisted with their PHP setup) will 
have problems.

	Then there should probably be a check that no interface

Wouldn't most Apache users use mod_php4?  Personally, my PHP lives in

When to use flow?

  For simple processes which can be broken down into
  a small set of chunks, then Deferred is the best way
  to go.  To make it worth while to use flow, you need
  one of the following:

    a) incremental results: for example, a big or slow
       executing database query that needs to process
       results as they become available.
 
    b) merging or splitting: for example, having two
       database queries running in parallel, the
       results being merged together

    c) complicated chunking: if your deferred chunks
       start to get numerous or have non-trivial logic
       in them, then flow would be useful.

    d) intensive computations: if your process has
       computations that need to be broken into
       chunks, then flow may be better than deferreds.

Recent changes:

   I renamed flow.ThreadedIterator to flow.Threaded,
   as it is now a wrapper (you don't inherit).

Fellow twisters,

I have finally read all that seemed necesary to get a good feel of
twisted! and I have finally been able to implement a few 'play'
programs.

I have a project I'd like to write, and I have always tought about it in
the normal "use a library" fashion (in oppisition to the "use a
framework").  My idea is to create a program that is a tournament
manager, it works kind of like this:

	* Accepts connections (there are 2 types, admin, regular).
		* Listen to the admin connection
			- Start tournament at admin's command 
			  This would create tournament brackets and actually give the
			  connected players the "play" command.
			- View current games
			- A bunch of other things :)

Then when the admin starts the games, the program would spun a new "game
thread" that would have the game logic, and that would keep track of the
game (check legality of moves), tell player A to go, tell B what A play,
tell B to go, decide on the winner, etc.

But now I find my self trying to think twisted. I am no longer in
control of the main program loop it seems.  I see how I can keep some of
my static info (having my Protocols register them in the Application).
What I'm having a hard time with is envisioning how to get my games
started, and how to keep track of them.  
* Where does my game-logic go?
* Do my protocols check for valid moves... if so, who keeps track of the
  board? The board is a share resource between 2 players of a short
  amount of time, and there are potentially many games going on at the
  same time.
* How can I implement timeouts?  So that players have to play within 
  given time-limits?  (like, X seconds per-move kinds of deals?)  I
  thougt about starting a timer in my Protocol when a "MAKE A MOVE"
  command is sent to the player, and then checking that time when the
  move is received... but this seems to involve threads?

Anyway, I'd really would appreciate your thoughts on this.  This
'higher-design' stuff is keeping me from getting dirty :)

Thanks.

I'd say there's two types of *users*.  There's no need to listen on
different ports, it's just a matter of who they authenticate as.

I think you want a TournamentService, see
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/pb-cred for details of using
Services in the context of PB, but hopefully you can get something out of it
even if you don't use PB.  See doc/examples/pbecho.py for an example of a
simple service.  Basically, it's:

    from twisted.internet.app import Application
    from twisted.cred.service import Service
    from twisted.cred.authorizer import DefaultAuthorizer

    class TournamentService(Service):
        """Game logic goes here"""

    myApp = Application('Tournament')
    auth = DefaultAuthorizer(myApp)
    svc = TournamentService('Tournament', myApp, auth)
    myApp.listenTCP(1234, YourProtocolFactory(svc))
    myApp.run()

I'd have a TournamentService keeping tracking of all the games running at
any time in a dict mapping players to a board.  So when a player sends a
move, the service looks up the player's board, and tells the board what that
player X wants to play move Y, and the board then accepts that or raises an
exception.  It's the board that knows what moves can be played at any given
time; the protocol's job is merely to pass messages to and from the player
on the network.

There's plenty of stuff built into Twisted for doing timeouts already, that
doesn't involve threads or anything icky.

You can use reactor.callLater, as described here:
   http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/time

Depending on what you're doing, you may also find the setTimeout method of
Deferreds to be useful.

I hope I've made it clearer for you.  Let us know if you're still unsure
about something.

[I think someone wrote a tic-tac-toe example, which might help a little
here... does anyone know where that is?]

Sorry about that.  There are two ways to make Threaded the threaded
wrapper operate.  In one case, the default, the wrapper yields for
every time that the wrapped iterator has returned.  In the other,
it assumes that the wrapped iterator returns a lists, and then 
yields for each item in those lists.

When I split QueryIterator and Threaded, there wasn't a way to 
let Threaded know that QueryIterator wants the second behavior,
so to do that you need to use the 'extend' option:

   flow.Threaded(flow.QueryIterator(...), extend = 1)

Anyway, I assume you are using the defaults, fetchall=0 for the 
QueryIterator, and extend = 0, for the Threaded wrapper.  In this
case, you could get N yields with M rows in them.  This is probably
the most efficient mechanism, as you spend less time in the flow
module, yet the results are incremental.

Right, and if your result set had more rows you'd get...

Although, to make it easier for programming, the 
extend = 1 option would make it return results...

Subject: [Twisted-Python] UDP servers and socket queues
Message-ID: <20030421142657.GB7900@wildfire0.net.ic.ac.uk>

All,

I'm porting an app over which had it's own async job thingy, similar to
Twisted's most basics - I now want it to run as a long-running server
with multiprotocol support, and Twisted is the logical choice.

The core of the app is a UDP-based RPC client (bespoke stuff) which does
a periodic flurry of activity (plus on-demand stuff - that's the plan
for later anyway).

The problem is that the flurry of activity fills the UDP socket queue,
and I think some simple changes to SelectReactor (which I've done
locally via a nasty/messy subclass) which could be useful to others will
fix it:

from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.internet import client

class RPCProtocol(protocol.DatagramProtocol):
    def __init__(self);
        # setup some icky stuff for retries etc here

    def datagramReceived(self, data, addr):
        pdu = self._decode(data)
        dfurred = self.outstanding[pdu.uuid]
        del self.outstanding[pdu.uuid]
        dfurred.callback(pdu)

    def sendPDU(pdu, addr):
        self.outstanding[pdu.uuid] = defer.Deferred()
        self.writeMessage(pdu.encode(), addr)
        return self.outstanding[pdu.uuid]

class endpoint:
    def __init__(self, protcol, host):
        self.protocol = protocol
        self.addr = resolve(host)
        self.actions = load_from_config(host)

    def go(self):
        pdu = self.create_pdu(self.actions.pop(0))
        self.protocol.sendPDU(pdu, self.addr).addCallback(self.handle)

    def handle(self, pdu):
        func = self.actions.pop(0)
        func(pdu)
        pdu = self.create_pdu(self.actions.pop(0))
        self.protocol.sendPDU(pdu, self.addr).addCallback(self.handle)
        
Anyway, you get the idea. The code fires up, and you get:

proto = RPCProtocol()
for host in hosts:
    ep = endpoint(proto, host)
    ep.go()

...the problem is that the responses come back too fast - they overflow
the UDP socket buffer after a couple of hundred packets. So, try this:

proto = RPCProtocol()
for host in hosts:
    ep = endpoint(proto, host)
    reactor.callLater(0, ep.go)

...except that the default SelectReactor will always execute any
pendingTimedCalls before calling doIteration (where the select() call
actually happens).

Ok, so inherit from SelectReactor and override mainLoop - except that
doIteration will only execute one doRead for each ready socket (there's
one socket - there are potentially thousands of hosts and I don't want
to overload either select()'s performance characteristics with the
number of fd's or the fd limit).

My old code did this:

while running:
    while 1:
        rs, ws, xs = select.select([self.fd,], [], [], self.timeout())
        if self.fd in rs:
            self.doRead()
        else:
            break
    for p in self.pending:
        p()

...i.e. empty the socket queue before doing *any* callback activity. I
can do this with a suitable reactor - it's just messy. Is it worthwhile
a flag in the core SelectReactor to change the preferences for
network/callback behaviour and the rate of network activity?

Just a thought.

Twisted is excellent work - keep it up!

Have you tried doing reactor.callLater(smallFloatButNotZero, ep.go)?  
If you use a small number it typically won't happen in that iteration.

I'll take a look at trying to fix this sometime this week. The solution
will be to do up to X reads of UDP packets in each iteration of the
event loop, instead of reading only one packet in each iteration.

I figured something like that. Does anyone know if the various socket
readiness abstractions (select(), poll(), kqueue, RT signals, etc.)
given you sufficient information to know when you can do multiple reads?

The other option I guess would be to for connection-less sockets to do:

while 1:
    try:
        data, addr = self.socket.recvfrom(65535)
        self.protocol.datagramReceived(data, addr)
    except socket.error, se:
        if se.args[0]==errno.EWOULDBLOCK:
            break
    except:
        log.deferr()

...in doRead (line 91, twisted/internet/udp.py)?

On second thoughts, (having just tested it) that alone won't be
sufficient, although it does make things a lot cleaner. The problem also
is:

proto = RPCProtocol()
for host in hosts:
    ep = endpoint(proto, host)
    reactor.callLater(0, ep.go)

...the in mainLoop of SelectReactor (or rather the subclass which reads
from the network *first*):


while self.running:
    try:
        while self.running:
            # Still need to reverse the order of the read
            # versus the call of functions
            t2 = self.timeout()
            t = self.running and t2
            self.doIteration(t)
            # Advance simulation time in delayed event
            # processors.
            self.runUntilCurrent()
    except:
        log.msg("Unexpected error in main loop.")
        log.deferr()
    else:
        log.msg('Main loop terminated.')

...the runUntilCurrent will execute *all* the callLater's that are
queued, which takes a couple of seconds (say) - however, halfway though
the runUntilCurrent, a sufficient number of replies has been returned to
overflow the socket input buffer - so you still need to somehow limit
the amount of work done in runUntilCurrent.

Now, I could put "reactor.callLater(when, ep.go)" then "when += 0.1" but
as the process runs more callLaters will happen, will pile up against
each other, and eventually the same problem will likely occur.

Interesting behaviour though!

Yeah, you weren't logged on, so there was no currentAccount (i.e., it was set 
to None). If you want, you can add a check to say "if not self.currentAccount"
and pop up a nice dialog with an error message :-)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted 1.0.4 - `html' .vs. `xhtml'
Message-ID: <oqof2zjtuo.fsf@titan.progiciels-bpi.ca>

Hello.

In the `doc/' hierarchy of the Twisted 1.0.4 distribution, some `.html'
files have links to `.xhtml' files, where apparently `.html' files by the
same base exist.  Should `.html' rather point to `.html' files whenever
possible?  Here are possible points to visit:

* `doc/index.html' has references to `howto/index.xhtml', 'man/index.xhtml',
  `specifications/index.xhtml' and `vision/index.xhtml'.

* `doc/howto/woven.html' refers to `listings/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.html'
  correctly, yet the text says `Listing 2: HelloWorld.xhtml...' which does
  not exist; it also refers to `listings/TwistedQuotes/WovenQuotes.xhtml'
  and says so in the text, yet sadly, there is no corresponding `.html' file.

* `doc/howto/domtemplate.html' refers to `TwistedQuotes/WebQuotes.xhtml',
  while the text which announces `Listing 2: WebQuotes.html...', and sadly,
  the reference is correct while the text is not.

* `doc/howto/lore.html', `doc/api/private/twisted.lore.default.html' and
  `doc/api/public/twisted.lore.default.html' also seem to indicate that
  `lore' will generate `.xhtml'; I am not familiar with `lore', and cannot
  say if it should or can generate `.html' instead.  If it can, it most
  probably should for generated documents to pointed to by `.html' files.

P.S. - I'm using `links' by preference (fast startup and reasonable image
support), which `links' does not seem to support `.xhtml' files.  Given that
`.html' is pretty widespread and reasonably understood by all Web browsers,
while `.xhtml' is more recent or specialised, would not it be a good idea to
aim `.html' as a uniform standard base for interactive documentation, (given
it ought to go through Web browsers), and offer `.xhtml' merely as an extra?

Hi, people.

In Twisted 1.0.4, file `doc/howto/domtemplate.html' has this line:

For my own taste, the first (latex2html) is a bit more legible, because it
has less distracting boxes, and the diagrams are more neat.  The navigation
bars at the beginning and the end give a bit of decoration, outside the
text, which is OK.  We should stay aware that "good looking" is only of
secondary value for documentation, legibility always goes before art.

By saying so, you reveal a prejudice towards the second (Lore).  :-)

I'm a newcomer to Twisted, and `im' is suggested right in the `README', that
is, really early in the adventure of discovering Twisted.  It would probably
be worth that Twisted polishes the first impressions it creates, or else,
that explanations like above be added to the `README' file. :-)

In that respect, what I want is a somewhat irrelevant.  Let's use some good
horse sense.

Yes, the '.html' should link to '.html'.  They '.html' files are the source
format for our documentation generation system that will process these to
'.xhtml' files, with various nice things done to them (including changing
the links to point to the .xhtml).

This is actually a known problem (someone else reported this a couple of
days ago).  I'll take care of it in CVS later today.

Lore's default behaviour is '.html' -> '.xhtml'.  If you are reading the
docs, just ignore the .html files and read the .xhtml, which are nicer
anyway.

I suspect links is probably having problems with the lack of <!DOCTYPE ...>
declarations in the .xhtml files, which is a bug in microdom.  Hopefully
this will be fixed soon.

Maybe, but so far, no.  Lore doesn't munge links with / in them at the
moment, which is usually plenty.

I'm actually intending on changing that to munging all relative links, or
perhaps all relative links under the current working directory (but that
seems a touch too magical).  If I do that, then a class="no_munge" is
probably justified -- although I'd prefer a better name for it :)

So, in your opinion, any browser which does not grok `.xhtml' is not real?
Happily enough, my preferred non-real browser is very useful as it stands,
and it seems that `.xhtml' is still exceptional rather than the usual in
real life, for a tremendous lot of people.  Ah, religions, religions... :-)
I hope Twisted is its own goal, and not an occasion for random proletysm!

	It should do this already, in any case. It's a bug it doesn't.

Hmm. Without going into irrelevant detail, I'm certain the UDP is the
appropriate protocol for this application, for a number of reasons, but
thanks for the comment.

Well, links could be more intelligent here, and it seems other browsers
manage to figure this out just fine.  Neither the presence of a <!DOCTYPE
...> declaration or the opening <html> tag seem sufficient for links to
realise that it is dealing with actual HTML.  Additionally, I wasn't able to
successfully configure my local links to recognise .xhtml as being
html/plain content, even though the menus seemed to suggest I could (it
happily accepted the entry, but the behaviour was unchanged).

I don't regard it as a major problem, though: in links you can hit "\" and
then it works.  Other browsers I've tried all seem fine -- as is links if
you are reading it off the website, which of course sets the Content-type
HTTP header.  Considering that you are the first person to report this
problem, I doubt this is worth the effort for us to "fix".  

You are welcome to locally rename or symlink the .xhtml files to .html if
you're really inconvenienced by this ;)

Or you can read the .ps or .pdf format -- or read it from the website, which
works around links' limitations.

> I hope Twisted is its own goal, and not an occasion for random proletysm!

The true goal of Twisted is to DESTROY THE SUN, of course.  Random proletysm

:-) :-).  I begin to see that Twisted has (or nearly has) all the needed
machinery towards this noble goal.  There surely is a lot of stuff
in there!  Yet, I guess I'll have to read some more before I can figure
out how to cleverly connect various parts towards the goal.  Beware! :-)

Yes, you can return a Deferred from a perspective_ method and it will
do the right thing.

Also, you can do something like this

    def perspective_X(self):
        #doSomeOperation here returns a Deferred
        return doSomeOperation().addCallbacks(self.mungeIt, self.ohCrap)

... And implement mungeIt and ohCrap to take the result, munge it in some
useful way, and return it. The return value will be used as the result
on the client side (who originally did callRemote('X'))
This way you can do some processing on the result of your operation
before the client gets it, if you need to.

No no no no. getgrall could theoretically return a *huge* number of
groups, and/or individual groups could have *huge* numbers of members.
For a system with /etc/passwd and /etc/group only, this doesn't matter,
but think about a system with an LDAP (RFC2307) nameservice backend - I
just tested it on my machine, and getgrall results in over 48Mb of
LDAP queries based on our ActiveDirectory groups. Many tens of seconds.

However, calling initgroups results in a single query:

memberUid=foo

...and only returns the groupname and gid, so is efficient every time.
The "right" way to do this is the getgrouplist() call (see
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=getgrouplist) and if you
look at the NSS code in e.g. glibc the NSS modules can provide
"efficient" hooks which initgroups() and getgrouplist() can implement.
initgroups() in glibc basically calls getgrouplist() on the NSS plugin
and so whilst the *result* is the same, you're taking the slow path.

This is important - don't use the sucky getgrent (in fact, I'm an

	Certainly you are correct. The point you are missing is
	that we are programming in Python, not in C. And Python does
	not have initgroups.

	We could add initgroups into eunuchs
	(http://twistedmatrix.com/users/tv/eunuchs/), or use the
	initgroups module by one of the Twisted developers; the code
	could be rewritten to try importing the C part, and falling
	back to the dumb version. Then using the smart API would be a
	true optimization.

	However, before I touched it, the code did _NOTHING_ unless
	the C initgroups module was available. And that resulted in
	bad things.

	getgrouplist() is as much missing from python stdlib as
	initgroups(), so you aren't really helping there.

I'm not yet a Twisted user, but intend to use it over two sites, (and maybe
a third withinin a few months).  All sites run Python 2.2.1 or better.

Forgive my confusion, but why isn't this sort of thing entirely up to the
server? Shouldn't the client merely obey the Content-Type: header?

I'm willing to believe it's more confusing than that, both because I've seen
it break and because I've seen the zillion mapping preferences in web
browsers, but I'd love to know how it's *supposed* to work before all the
band-aids got applied. In-line magic numbers like <html> or <!DOCTYPE> are
what MIME was supposed to get rid of.

The problem they're talking about is when you `links' a *local* file, so no
mime-type information is available.

We currently are using Twisted (just upgraded to 1.0.4) along with Zope 2.5.1,
Zope for the "front end" (but only for as long as it takes until we can remove it)
and Twisted for the "back end" of our application.  Zope still uses Python 2.1
so we would be unable to do this with Python 2.2.  Since we will definitely
have excised all traces of Zope by the time anything really changes with
Twisted and 2.2, I'm not seriously concerned but I thought I'd note it as
an interesting data point.

Also perhaps interesting, though off-topic, is that we patched 1.0.3 to
run under Python 2.0 (just a few quick hacks) successfully, as we are
still using that on our network for development, even though this one
particular application deploys with Python 2.1.  It was rather simple
with 1.0.3 although I'm not sure whether we'll have better or worse
luck when we try this with 1.0.4.  Chances are the nested scopes have
propagated throughout more of the code now...

> 2. Do you have any Twisted success stories you'd like to share (besides

Eventually we will have something more official to report, but just for
this list, unofficially :-), for now, I'd like to report that Kaval
Wireless Technologies Inc (www.kaval.com) is integrating Twisted into a 
server application which is used to monitor equipment in wireless coverage 
extension systems.  (The monitoring links themselves are not wireless, so Twisted
is carrying only data which travelled as electrons, not as radio waves...)

Until now we'd been using Zope, but it was really not the most appropriate
choice since this isn't a content management system.  Twisted appears
more robust, lighter weight, and likely to prove much more amenable to
rapid development on our end, and as a hardcore XP team we highly
appreciate the XP approach of the Twisted team and look forward to
contributing as we learn more.  I don't want to diminish Zope, which
provided an effective platform at an earlier stage, but we've definitely
grown beyond it and are tightly constrained by its limitations and
difficult development model.

I am writing clone of my worknode in C++, so Twisted version is used
just until I complete C++ version. This is because of productivity
concerns, I have hit Python's productivity ceiling. After that I may
succeed in writing cluster kernel and web interface in Twisted. I.e.
still no success story, sorry.

Have you considered using something like BOOST.Python or Pyrex to do 
optimized implementations of the portions that have poor performance?  
Typically, rewriting the whole thing in C/C++ is a bad idea.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] newbie -- trying to do async ldap operations
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.51.0304221724530.3672@garp.ucs.indiana.edu>

First to set my perspective -- I never heard of Twisted before two days
ago.

I have an XMLRPC server built with the Medusa framework.  I am looking at
moving the methods to Twisted in order to take advantage of Deferreds, SSL
support, and based on my brief exposure, the overall framework seems
cleaner.

This is a simplification, but to keep this short I have an XMLRPC method
that returns results from an LDAP search.  Currently the searches are
synchronous but they are fast enough that it has not been a problem.  Now
I need to expand the search filter options which will (could) result in a
slower search.

The OpenLDAP API (and python-ldap) supports asynchronus searching.  Sounds
perfect.  A call to ldap.search_s() returns a message ID which is later
used in a call to result() to get the results.  ldap.result() takes the
message ID, and a timeout argument which if zero is in effect a poll.

So what I want is for my XMLRPC method to invoke search_s and get the
message ID.  Then create a defered and provide its callback and the
message ID to something that will poll ldap.result() until it returns
results (if results are not ready it will return [None, None]) and then
pass those to the callback.  Here's where I get confused; I think the call
to ldap.result() needs to be done by reactor somehow since ldap.result()
may need to be called repeatedly before results are ready) but I'm not
sure.

The whole deferred light bulb has not quite come on for me yet, so I
appreciate any guidance.  The defer HOWTO examples all use something like
reactor.callLater() to represent a "delayed result" which is not really
helping me.  The XMLRPC example of returning a defered just returns
defer.succeed("hello"), again not quite a rich enough example.

I thought about adapting the adbapi stuff for LDAP, but the notion is in
my head that I should be able to do this without threads since the ldap
API supports async operations.

Many thanks,

Allan

Arte you using them in the same process? Or as separate processes? Any
reason you can't install two versions of Python at once?

Eek, polling is terrible. You should check out Tv's Ldaptor for Twisted:
http://twistedmatrix.com/users/tv/ldaptor/
It's a natively-Twisted LDAP client library.

Also (it's moot if you'll use ldaptor, which I recommend, but..), returning the
message ID as the result of the Deferred, and requiring the caller to poll,
is a bad idea. You would do the polling yourself (every iteration of the
mainloop, with a reactor.callLater(0, pollIt) or somesuch), and once the
result is available, trigger the Deferred with it.

Message-ID: <20030422233938.GA4946@localhost.localdomain>

Twisted 1.0.4

I have evidence of the SerialPort class blocking.  

strace says write operations are blocking and always return the number
of bytes to be written.

The problem goes away if I set the file descriptor on the object to
non-blocking using posixy controls.

Test program below.

No. I am happy for this to change.
My only concern would be Debian packaging issues.

Cooperate() is called when an iterator would block, thus,
the flow module allows other tasks (connections, users)
to continue.   If you look at the source for flow.Threaded
you will see that it raises Cooperate() when the database
hasn't produced data yet.

  Here's something that might help (note that I am not familiar with the
python-ldap API, so I'm just guessing at how it is laidd out):

    from twisted.internet import reactor, defer

    class LDAPQueryTracker:
        def __init__(self):
            self._ids = {}

        # Wrapper around python-ldap's search function
        # returns a Deferred whose callback will be invoked
        # with the result
        def search(self, args):
            id = ldap.search_s(args)
            self._ids[id] = defer.Deferred()
            reactor.callLater(0, self.poll)
            return self._ids[id]

        # A method to poll any "live" queries,
        # and to schedule another poll if there are any
        # remaining outstanding queries
        def poll(self):
            for (id, d) in self._ids.items():
                r = ldap.result(id, timeout=0):
                if r is not None:
                    del self._ids[id]
                    d.callback(r)
            if self._ids:
                reactor.callLater(0, self.poll)

    # Two trivial callbacks to handle the result
    def printResult(result):
        print 'LDAP result:', result
    def printFailure(failure):
        print 'LDAP failed!'
        failure.printTraceback()

    # Make a tracker, perform a query, and add some callbacks
    qt = LDAPQueryTracker()
    d = qt.search("humm, I have no idea what an ldap query looks like")
    d.addCallbacks(printResult, printFailure)

    # Do it.
    reactor.run()


  Hope this helps,

  Jp

Thanks, Jp, your example is helpful.  I will give it a try.

(Note to other readers -- ldap.search_s() is the synchronous (blocking)
method.  The async method is ldap.search().  I've been using
ldap.search_s() up until now and my fingers automatically typed that.)

I saw that and downloaded the latest .tar.gz, but it was not immediately
obvious how it worked.  There seemed to be no documentation -- did I miss
it?  I'll peruse through the code a bit more; I'm all for not reinventing
the wheel, but on the other hand I'm very happy with the python-ldap

Yes, that's what I was trying to say.  I probably did not say it well.
Thanks.

there's any difference?

Perusing the code/design of iperf may be useful for whoever does this.
Those of us who routinely do very high speed data transfers (1GBit+
streams) use iperf regularly to ensure the end-to-end performance
characteristics of the path.

Just as a point of pedanticism, what happens if you configure your 
local links to recognise .xhtml as "text/html" rather than "html/plain"?

Good question.

Answer: still no luck.

(Incidentally, I tried "html/plain" because of the "Toggle html/plain    \"
entry in the View menu, which made it render the page properly.)

Same process.  Rewriting as two processes, communicating via

On Debian woody (stable), Python/GTK+ is available only for Python 2.1.
This means woody users would not be able to use the GUI clients in Twisted
(some of which are GTK+-based). In addition, other libraries which specific
developers might wish to use might be unavailable for Python 2.2. I can
probably conjure up a list of such libraries.

I've already made my position clear on IRC, but figured it should be
documented here as well :)

The book is a collaboration of many Twisted developers.
Andrew and I are responsible for making the book out of the various

Ho well. So, Cooperate() is a kind de defered (for flows) ?

My apologies - I thought the discussion was *about* the use or non-use
of the initgroups C module, rather than what to do in the absence. My
bad.

Has any thought been given to a PEP for adding initgroups() and/or
getgrouplist() to the Python standard "group" module?

twisted.internet.app.theApplication doesn't actually appear until the

You're right, those examples were ancient. I've updated them to match the
current code, and removed some of the most unhelpful pieces.

	There's no HOWTO-style documentation (because *I* don't
	usually want to read such, so I don't want to write it), but
	there current head of the tree actually has decent
	docstrings. Here's a few links:

	API Docs: http://tv.debian.net/software/ldaptor/api/

	Main site: http://tv.debian.net/software/ldaptor/

	See the latest code: http://ldaptor.bkbits.net/



	There's also *13* example client apps, as of now.

	The search utility should be reasonably obvious:

	http://ldaptor.bkbits.net:8080/ldaptor/anno/bin/ldaptor-search at 1.12?nav=index.html|src/|src/bin


	You also have this great mailing list to ask questions on.

  I have some code I can use to test this, I'll post results when I get a
chance.

  An apparent problem, though.  On Windows, under Cygwin:

    File "C:\cygwin\home\amir\Twisted\twisted\internet\udp.py", line 39, in ?
      from errno import WSAEAGAIN as EAGAIN

| Ho well. So, Cooperate() is a kind de defered (for flows) ?

Well, Cooperate is the whole reason for flow... otherwise you
could just use recursive generators.   Basically, in one of 
your generators (Threaded(QueryIterator())), your code would 
block waiting for a row, etc.  So rather than blocking, Threaded
returns Cooperate.   This return value is handled by the wrappers
all the way up the call chain.  At the top of the call chain is
Deferred, and when Deferrerd gets a Cooperate, it does a 
callLater(0, self), so that other processes can run.  


Suppose you have generator X -> Y -> Z, the picture 
then looks like...

     Wrap  <--  Z
      |
      v
     Wrap  <--> Y
      |   
      v
     Wrap  <--> X
      |
      V
     Deferred
      |
      V
     reactor

So, rather than X talking to Y, talking to Z, each of
your generators is talking to a wrapper instead, which
tries to be as transparent as possible.   The 
wrapper has the following behavior:

    0.  If a value is returned from a generator to 
        a wrapper, it is given to the previous generator
        in the chain; at the bottom of the chain it is
        added to an array which is sent to the deferred's
        callback.  Failures are handled the same way.

    1.  If the value returned is a wrapper, then it adds
        the new wrapper to the top of the stack and 
        starts to process it.

    2.  When Cooperate is returned from a generator, 
        it is sent all the way down the Wrapper linked
        list so that the reactor can re-schedule the
        processing chain (micro-thread).

So, I hope this helps.  Cooperate is the whole reason
for flow... without the need to 'pause' the whole stack
one wouldn't need the wrapper at all.

Actually, the diagram isn't quite right.  Here is a better one.

Suppose you have generator X -> Y -> Z, the picture 
then looks like...

     Wrap  <--  Z
         \ 
           \

Hello, Twisted people.

Out of the box (yet I already did `python setup.py install --prefix=/usr,

Should these be expected?  Reported?  This is over a SuSE 8.1 Linux.

Message-ID: <oqof2wx4u6.fsf@alcyon.progiciels-bpi.ca>

Hello, Twisted people.

In the manual found as `doc/howto/book.ps', some figures are inserted in
the text with a 90 degree rotation.  Despite this is not a great evil,
they would appear better if not rotated.  There is one on page 10 (1.1
High-Level Overview of Twisted); another on page 76 (4.6.2 Deferreds -
Visual Explanation); another on page 147 (6.3.3 The Diagram), and maybe
others, I did not try to be exhaustive here.

The figure on page 10 drops off the page, however, and this is more
serious, as one does not figure out how much of it is missing (I mean,
without looking at the HTML rendering of that section, which is OK).

All the source material for the Twisted PyCon papers and slides should
be in doc/historic/2003/pycon/.


Hey gang, what's the recommended procedure to make them pretty (i.e.
in-line the source examples, etc)?  Is that something that's supposed to
be part of the release process but we forgot to add to
admin/process-docs when we added these papers?  And if these papers are
really going to be static and unchanging, what do you think of
committing their rendered forms to the repository?

  Woops.  This is a localization problem.  Maybe it should be an expected
skip for certain values of LC_LANG?  Or maybe we should just not use ls.

  Multicast is known to be broken in a few situations.  Can you describe
your network setup.  In particular, do you have a firewall configured, or is
the machine performing NAT?

Hmm, it means popen2 used french while reactor.spawnProcess used english.
That test clears the environment before running spawnProcess.. maybe we
should let it inherit the complete environment from its parent.

Could you try the attached patch and see if it fixes the problem?

I've seen that test fail on machines that don't have any external network
interfaces configured (just the loopback interface). My guess is that it has
to do with the 'MULTICAST' flag, which isn't usually set on lo.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted 1.0.4 - `mktap --help SERVER'
Message-ID: <oqk7dkx18v.fsf@alcyon.progiciels-bpi.ca>

Hi, still me.

After having quickly glanced over the manual, I'm reading it a bit more
carefully now, and if comments like this message continue to pop up, you
will observe my progression, or non-progression if I cannot find enough
time :-), without my real will.  Sigh!  OK, let not me be too shy...

Page 21 (2.2.3 mktap and tapconvert) says: "For a given server, `mktap
--help <name>' shows the possible configuration options.".  The following
shell script:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
#!/bin/bash
for s in coil conch dns ftp im inetd mail manhole news parent pinger ponger \
	 portforward procmon sibling socks telnet toc web words zoot; do
  echo $s =====================================
  mktap --help $s < /dev/null
done
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

seems to show that this is not completely true.

* For coil, dns, ftp, im, mail, pinger, ponger, portforward, socks, telnet,
  toc, web, words and zoot, I got no output at all, so I presume this
  may be interpreted as meaning that these servers use no option.  Yet,
  for all those, a `.tap' file was created, which is probably not what
  one expect from a mere `--help' option.  So maybe the `--help' did not
  work so well after all.

* I also got many DeprecationWarnings, which probably should not be there.
  Let's see:

  + conch yields:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->

----------------------------------------------------------------------<

  and for these three cases as well, a `.tap' file was created.  So maybe
  `--help' does not work as documented for these either.

* manhole did ask for supplementary information, like this:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Password: 
Confirm: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

  While sorting and cleaning out my various tries, I also found another
  case for `mktap --help manhole' which yielded the following:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
An error unexpected occurred:
  File "/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/tap/manhole.py", line 45, in opt_password
    self['password'] = util.getPassword(confirm=1)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/python/util.py", line 154, in getPassword
    if password[-1] == '\n':
IndexError: string index out of range
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

  yet I do not find back the exact recipe I use for producing this.
  Maybe the traceback will give hints about another problem?  In any case,
  a `.tap' file was created.

* For inetd, I got:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
An error unexpected occurred:
  File "/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/runner/inetdconf.py", line 90, in parseLine
    self.parseFields(*line.split())
  File "/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/runner/inetdconf.py", line 174, in parseFields
    raise InvalidServicesConfError, 'Invalid port/protocol:' + \
InvalidServicesConfError: Invalid port/protocol:'3322-3325'
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

  At least, no `.tap' was created. :-)

* Both news and procmon provided the expected help output, and created no
  `.tap'.  However, the help was assorted with an error diagnostic,
  which is probably not appropriate for a mere help request.

  + news help output was prefixed with:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Usage Error: No newsgroups specified
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

  + procmon help output was suffixed with:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Wrong number of arguments.
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

  Even if the errors were expected, they should _ideally_ be presented
  both before, or both after; and both have the `Usage Error:' prefix,
  or both not have it.

All in all, I'm left with the impression that `--help' does not work,
or at least, not as documented in the book.

It might be worth, maybe, adding another unit test which makes sure that
`mktap --help <name>' produces for all servers, some output (on standard
output ideally, not standard error), or no output at all, but surely no
traceback, and with an exit status that would be consistently zero.

  After looking at this for more minutes than it probably merited, I feel
that this usage should stay gone (rather than have mktap be fixed to
work as documented).

  It requires --help to be both a flag and a parameter, which usage does not
support directly.  It is also trivially achieved by reversing the order of
the arguments to be "mktap <name> --help".

  Any objections?  If not, I'll check in a doc fix tomorrow.

  I agree.  There are effectively no unit tests for either mktap or twistd,
and the acceptance tests only test it in well-formed cases, which are nice,
but probably the least important ones to *test*, since that is how the
developers will all be invoked the tools (and so they will get plenty of
testing that way).

And / or, maybe, the overall testing environment (not the user) should
reset LANG, LANGUAGE, LC_LANG, LC_ALL and LC_MESSAGES before proceeding,
all to non set, or less ideally, set to empty, to `C' or to `POSIX'.

Wow!  All this from a mere "list index out of range"! :-)

There is indeed a firewall on the machine I use for testing Twisted, at
least on the network card facing the Internet, and masquereding is done
for internal machines forwarded from a second network card.  I would not
think beforehand that localhost as limitations against itself, however,
but am never fully sure, I do not often visit the firewall configuration.
I naively think that I can access localhost:ANYPORT without the firewall
being in the way.

I'm willing to revisit the firewall if you have a suggestion for me about
how to carefully open it, enough for Twisted to work reliably.

I surely could use, for testing Twisted, an internal machine which has
no intrinsic firewall, on some other internal network, but this might
not be where I want to run it in the long run.  Opinions?

Sadly, the new module lives only in my head at the moment.  I'd guess I'll
probably have it in CVS within a month.

Do you just want a simple FTP server that serves files from the filesystem?
If so, you may be able to use the existing code, but beware... it doesn't
have much access control beyond "authenticated" and "not authenticated",
which means that if you have anonymous access enabled, *anyone* use any FTP
command, including STOR, and so on.  If you want to use the existing code,
make sure to run it from a directory whose contents (including the directory
itself!) are read-only, even for the owner.  It *might* be safe to use then,
but I haven't rigorously checked that :)

What do you want to use an FTP server for?   :)

-Andrew.

This works ok for me locally (using a copy of book.ps I built myself).  I
suspect the hack I use to make dia scale down the images when converting to
.eps is broken with some versions of dia.  I've been meaning to find a nicer
way to do this anyway...

Thanks for bug reports!

Thomas,

We should probably have those linked somewhere from
twistedmatrix.com.  Hopefully, that can be resolved soon.  Until then,
look in the doc/historic/2003/pycon directory for all of the papers
and most of the slides (I think).  This can be found in the 1.0.4
release or from Twisted CVS.

I was the one who gave the Twisted Web tutorial.  Unfortunately, I
didn't get a paper written.  I do, however, have slides.  They are
with the docs mentioned above or you can look at them at:

http://www.twistedmatrix.com/users/nafai/pycon-paper/

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  Sorry if the slides are
a little sparse.

Travis

I'm not using Twisted yet, but I expect to use it within a month or two. 
  I'll be porting an asyncore/chat based app developed using python 2.0. 
  I will definitely be adding some 2.2 features at the same time, so, in 
other words, no, I don't need 2.1 support :)

> 2. Do you have any Twisted success stories you'd like to share (besides

Not yet, but this application will see some serious usage starting in 
September.  It could potentially see peaks of 90k-200k clients 
connecting in a 24 hour span.  Hopefully I'll be able to report positive 
results to this list during load-tests.  Rewriting outside of 
python/twisted is obviously a no-go at this point, so if load testing 
comes up short we'll just throw more hardware at it!! :O

Side note: we're going to be using DNS round robin + Wackamole + Spread 
toolkit for server load balancing.  I haven't needed to use the python 
spread interface developed by Jeremy, Guido and Tim yet 
(http://www.python.org/other/spread/) but I'm wondering if anyone's 
tried to integrate that into Twisted?  I'd love for spread mailboxes to 
be processed through reactor like any other socket :)

no. But why don't wait somes month and switch directly to python2.3 ?

I did an online scrabble game. But i did'nt use a lot of feature of

You can use spawnProcess on windows by using the win32 reactor, see the
Choosing Reactors howto for instructions.

Well I don't think any of us have found that python 2.3 has significant 
new conveniences that can't be done adequately in 2.2 (i.e., it's 
possible to implement the itertools module in pure python, emulate the 
new dict creation behavior, etc.).  It seems to be mostly new modules, 
bugfixes, and performance enhancements.  Moving from 2.1 to 2.2 does 
have significant new features, though (mostly generators and new style 
classes).

Also, when 2.3 is released, hopefully in a few months, it'll probably 
take the better part of a year /after/ that for python 2.3 to come into 
common use (i.e. ISPs, linux distributions, etc.).

	This blocks right here; maybe it blocks in the ldap.initialize part, too.

	And it's error return mechanism seems to be by way of
	exceptions, so making it async will change the API, too.

   I'll probably just replace it once the hacking is done, unless

Right now I'm thinking of parameterizing what goes into the

Python/GTK+ is only necessary for two arguably experimental portions of 
Twisted - im and manhole.  I think that it is acceptable to remove 
support in Debian woody for these, considering that more substantial, 
stable portions of Twisted (e.g. Conch, and twisted.web SSL) don't 
work, since they require libraries that are missing on woody.  Future 
GTK+ work is going to be using GTK2 anyway, considering that it is 
vastly more stable for the kinds of things we want to do, most of which 
involve displaying large, scrolling blocks of text.

PyQT is technically in Debian, but the version in Woody isn't very 
useful, and I haven't heard from anyone using it with Twisted.

There are no third-party programs that support Debian woody which 
require GTK to be working with Twisted.

As to other libraries - my primary concern was with database drivers 
which may have been incompatible with Python-2.2.  However, it appears 
that all DB-API compatible drivers that come with Woody have both 
python-2.1 and python-2.2 versions.

I've just spent the last few weeks working without the 2.1-support 
constraint, and I can see why all the Twisted developers have been 
clamoring for 2.2 :-).  While I have some concern that moving along 
with rearrangements of Python's basic semantics encourages the 
development of useless, whiz-bang infrastructure, the fact is that the 
new object model is substantially more amenable to necessary features 
like those implemented in twisted.python.components and 
twisted.python.reflect.

The results of this survey appear to indicate that most Twisted users 
are not using Python-2.1, and those that are plan to stop in the near 
future.  Also, as far as I can tell, nobody on the development team 
uses Python 2.1 any more, and so test failures related to 2.1 
incompatibilities are always caught after the fact.

I think it would improve our development speed and the general attitude 
of the team, so I propose we cut over to 2.2 immediately.  For the 
reasons I gave above, I don't think the GTK situation is important 
enough to prevent this.  If anyone else would like to give reasons for 
not going ahead with this, please speak now or forever hold your peace 
:)

(This does not mean "everybody check in 2.2-only code".  It means "get 
ready to check in 2.2-only code".  I will hopefully announce open 
season on 2.2 features later this week.)

I use 2.2 in my production environment.  However...

Python 2.1 was the "blessed" version of Python that Guido had
said would be supported for a _long_ time out (like 1.5 was).
It is also, as Moshe points out, the Debian standard and I know
many debian people who won't be upgrading.    This may play
a role in 'hosted environments' where people would like to 
deploy Twisted, but really can't reinstall Python. 

Also, with etrepum's recent patches to twisted.python.compat, 
much Twisted can still use the iterator protocol (compatible 
with 2.1).   Re-writing generators as 2.1 iterators is tedious,
but quite straight forward.

I can see some places where the use of generators is too much of
a goodness to pass up.   Why not mark those modules explicitly,
and make them 2.2 only?  For example, Woven could probably really
use 2.2 features.   In this way those users who insist on 2.1 can
use the bulk of (but perhaps not all of) Twisted, in such a way
that we don't compromise future development.

Also, someone posted that it didn't take too many changes to 
make Twisted 2.0 compatible.  Perhaps we should consider 
committing those changes.   Nested scopes are nice, especially
in application code, but they certainly arn't essential 
to library development.

Best,

Clark

No, that was 2.2.

Debian Woody has Python 2.2 included.

'Twas I who said something like that, but I have to caution
that it was definitely not a case of making all of Twisted
run under 2.0.  All I did, as a spike, was to repeatedly run 
our little test program, which imported about three things from
twisted.internet, and patch -- in the most hideously ugly but
direct manner that I could -- anything which complained.  

I think there were about three complaints, two of which were
nested scope warnings.  To fix these, I simply removed the
"from __future__" statement and ran again.  I think the other
thing needed a stub/mock of some kind, with no functionality.
I supposed the code involved is either not being invoked (but
was giving syntax errors or warnings), or is managing to function 
normally or near normally in spite of being invoked without nested 
scopes working.  

There are probably a *lot* of latent problems, but for our purposes 
it seems to be adequate.  There's no way I'd translate this into 
a suggestion any of these changes should be checked in though! :-)

Hello,


Being new to twisted, I didn't find in the documentation an example  (in DOM
Template, widgets, woven or resource templates ), for implementing a form.

Someone has a link?

There will be a whole bunch of new, up-to-date docs on Woven in CVS within a
week.  I believe this includes a general tutorial and stuff about using
forms.

If you can, wait until we've got those docs ready.  Otherwise, you could try
asking for advice on #twisted on irc.freenode.net, which is currently the
best place for Woven docs (until the new docs get checked in...)

no. i wrote my own authorizer because DatabaseAuthorizer was not up to
the task.

put service and perspective names in database and allow for the client

that would be nice (and is what my authorizer does, btw.)

That was my thinking, too.  

Any chance you would be willing to share your authorizer?  
Some of us actually prefer not to reinvent wheels ... :^)

all my code (and i mean *all*, even the one i write for customers) is
available from cvs.initd.org under GPL. you may be interested in the
following files:

http://cvs.initd.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/wilma-prototype-2/server/wilmad
http://cvs.initd.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/wilma-prototype-2/wilma/server/auth.py
http://cvs.initd.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/wilma-prototype-2/wilma/server/service.py

they implement a db authorizer with just one service ("wilma") and some
perspectives, taken from the keyring (for example the "admin"
perspective is available only to people that have the "admin" role in
DB). i planned a better version (the code in wilma is very specific for
that project) but i have almost no time nowdays.. too much work.

also, for wilma we are moving to a much more fine-grained authorization
policy that does not involve perspectives, but that's completely OT
here.

one more: wabba is a generic "transaction manager" that takes a
completely different approach to dababase access than other
object-relational mappers (i talked about it with itamar on irc someweek
ago). it is still very alpha and we are reworking it a lot but there
will be an "official" release around june. it integrates well with
twisted.

hope this helps,
federico

Yes and yes. Don't hardcode table and fieldnames. 
Maybe you want to produce more detailed errors why the auth failed. I.e. when 
you have several services and a user isn't subscribed to one of them you'll 
get an "unknown user" error,  I think you should get a different error saying 
something about "service subscribtion" if the user is subscribed to other 
services on the same server.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, or out of date, but doesn't request.args
contain *lists* of things, always, and not the strings directly?  That
was what I observed on 1.0.3 anyway, I thought.

If that's so, then I think the above test will always pass, as 
request.args['text'] would contain [''] or [] or something, but
never just "".

That is correct. request.args always contains lists.

I have 2.2 everywhere I have twisted.  :)

I have twisted running with ldaptor on over 200 Solaris systems, pulling
configs out of LDAP for inetd/dnscache/tinydns/ldap.conf (pam/nss)/cron
and a few others things.  I do keep my own cvs of both twisted and ldaptor 
due to my need for having TLS built directly in <HINT>.  (yes I sent a patch).
They are highly out of date but work for me now.

Do you use jython with twisted? AFAIK no one does. And it's close to
being useless anyway.

Hopefully by the time 1.4 is widespread and we can write a decent nio
reactor (the current java reactor is more proof-of-concept than useful
implementation), Jython will support 2.2.

Currently you can't even run the test suite with Jython, to say nothing 
of the tests actually passing.  There would be a lot of work involved 
in getting Twisted to run on Jython-2.1 as-is, and 2.2isms are not a 
part of that.

At some point I'll try to get Jython's CVS running with current 
twisted.  Maybe we can encourage them to do a release if Twisted works 
on CVS and not on the released versions :)

No requirement for 2.1 at all - using 2.2 as normal (freebsd 4.8 comes with 
2.2.2 out of the box) in fact, looking forward to 2.3. Lots of goodies there. 
In fact I only have the 2.1 that comes with binary zope.

If we do decide to drop support for a widely-deployed version of Python,
it is my firm belief that we should make setup.py fail loudly when used
with those versions. If nothing else, it will make sure the Debian build
will never work until I actually remove the build of non-supported versions.
Which reminds me: please don't drop 2.1 support until sarge's freeze (not
release -- but post-freeze, I'll be assured of my new uploads not getting
into sarge, and I'd really like sarge's Twisted to support 2.1)

That sounds like a good idea.

Why?  Doesn't sarge come with 2.2 as the default 'python', and pretty 
much every package compiled for it?

yes. default python for sarge is 2.2 (and there even was a discussion
about switching to 2.3 if a stable release happens before freeze [i
don't think it'll happen :)])

(the only reason for 2.1 in sarge is zope.)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] adapi.Connection._runQuery always does rollback()
Message-ID: <20030426135546.GA24250@localhost.localdomain>

RedHat 9.0 on intel
Twisted 1.0.4

In twisted.enterprise.adbapi we find this method of ConnectionPool:

    def _runQuery(self, args, kw):
        conn = self.connect()
        curs = conn.cursor()
        try:
            apply(curs.execute, args, kw)
            result = curs.fetchall()
            curs.close()
        finally:
            conn.rollback()
        return result

I do not understand the logic of always running a rollback even if the
query is successful.  I would, instead, expect this:

    def _runQuery(self, args, kw):
        conn = self.connect()
        curs = conn.cursor()
        try:
            apply(curs.execute, args, kw)
            result = curs.fetchall()
            curs.close()
        except:
            conn.rollback()
	    raise
        return result

And, indeed, this is _exactly_ what we see in adbapi._runOperation,
which is the method following _runQuery.

-Eric

PS. This buglet brought to you by MySQL which does not support rollback(), 
    and tells you with an exception.

The theory here, I believe is that queries are meant to have no side-effects
on the DB, so the rollback is done to guarantee this.  If you *do* want to
change the state of the DB, use runOperation.

Then the database module you are using doesn't adhere to DB-API 2.0[1], which
adbapi requires.

Sure, that's a theory.  And, yay, verily, MySQL isn't known for it's
strict adherance to standards.  However:

   http://www.python.org/topics/database/DatabaseAPI-2.0.html#connection

Says

 rollback()
    This method is optional since not all databases provide 
    transaction support.[3]

And footnote 3 sayeth:

    3 If the database does not support the functionality required by
    the method, the interface should throw an exception in case the
    method is used.

    The preferred approach is to not implement the method and thus
    have Python generate an AttributeError in case the method is
    requested. This allows the programmer to check for database
    capabilities using the standard hasattr() function.

    For some dynamically configured interfaces it may not be
    appropriate to require dynamically making the method
    available. These interfaces should then raise a NotSupportedError
    to indicate the non-ability to perform the roll back when the
    method is invoked.

Further, a rollback trashes a whole transaction.  The query could be
part of a larger transaction which includes update operations.
Granted, this is just silly in the async thread-pool, but that's why I
found it rather surprising.

For long running transactions you want to do the runTransaction or
whatever it's called method - the one where you pass a callable and it
gets run with a adbapi.Transaction object in a thread, thus allowing you
to do a series of database queries one after the other in a natural,
blocking way.

But, looks like we do need to deal with broken rollback support in
mysql. Is there any flag we can check, or must we trap AttributeError
and whatever mysql throws on rollback() calls?

One of the ACID properties is to provide for a consistent read,

If you don't rollback, then the 'read transaction' will still 
reflect results at the time the first query was executed.

Therefore, a rollback is needed so that subsequent queries
reflect new changes to the database and is not 'stale'.

This is an arguable point..

Consider, from a security standpoint, that an attacker is trying to
brute-force your server.  'service subscription' error says 'you have
correctly guessed a username, but are attempting to access the wrong
service'.  Having a valid username is much closer to a username/password
pair than not having a valid username.. ;p

Perhaps it should be configurable to behave both ways.

What type of database are you accessing?  Would transactions be
helpful?  MySQL has transaction-safe tables, you simply have to be
explicit when creating them (and all of your tables must be transaction
safe to avoid 'partial' rollbacks..).

What Conch does for this is takes whatever error 
the authentication raises, whether it be invalid 
user, invalid password, etc., and turns it into a 
generic 'not authenticated' message.  If you want 
to keep attackers from knowing which names are 
actual users, you probably just want to do that, 
rather than having a flag in the Authorizer.

I checked.  It's AttributeError.

Not at this time.

MySQL is very fast and very lightweight.  It also runs on platforms
like Win9X (the pain, the pain!).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Trial Refactoring
Message-ID: <20030426172323.GA620@sting>

I've made some pretty significant changes to trial tonight [1][2]. They 
have been mainly focussed on refactoring to reduce repeated code, and 
on being able to extend trial.

The tests work for me [3]. If they don't work for you, this is probably 
the reason. Please check for your platform as soon as possible and let 
the list know.

I have tried hard to keep the functionality as close to the original as 
possible, but there have been some changes.

Feel free to gaffle me and rollback the commit if this is a disastrous 
mistake.

cheers,
jml

your adapter is b0rked. as per dbapi-2.0 document:

            Database modules that do not support transactions should
            implement this method with void functionality.

Alrighty.  In case anyone else needs to do this before the MySQL
Python API is brought up-to-date, here's how I kludged it without
changing twisted:

    import MySQLdb

    def doNothing(*args, **kw):
       return None

    class AddRollback:
       def __init__(self, module):
	  self.doConnect = module.connect

       def connect(self, *args, **kw):
	  result = self.doConnect(*args, **kw)
	  result.rollback = doNothing
	  return result

    MySQLdb.connect = AddRollback(MySQLdb).connect

hi!

you did this in your 'application' code? (you know that this will block
your whole twisted app for the time of the query right? since MySQLdb is
not async .. and u'd need a thread to make it kinda async ..)

I meant to, but I guess I never did -- I'll do that now.

To summarize the discussion, you need to commit, not rollback,
as it's possible for select calls to have side effects. One example
is calling a stored procedure.

This makes sense.  For example, the stored procedure may update
an access log table which records the last time that a user looked
at a given peice of information.   This could be quite useful.

But, in any case, the 'transaction' should be terminated.  If it
was successful (no exception) then it should be committed, else
it should be rolled back...

yes, there is not that much difference between a Query and an Operation.
imho the adbapi can be cleaned up *a lot*, but i'll try that after
sending my big cleanup patch (that makes min/max of connections
working). i just need to find enough time to write a test case to
demonstrate it does not break anything.

Thanks. I know that the MySQLdb API blocks.

You will note that I'm not actually using the MySQLdb API in the code
below, but adding code which adds a rollback method to allocated
connection objects.  Long-running calls go through the
twisted.enterprise APIs.

to be honest - nothing - I have my own version based .10 and patches
hand applied as needed up to version .13.  With it being deployed on as
many systems we do the process of upgrading is not something we do
often.

I have not come across anything I was not able to do with ldaptor.  I
dont push it to hard, just a lot of searches and maybe a password change or
two. 

I don't really like the DNS SRV records and that way of connecting.  So 
I just don't use it.  

We have added TLS support to ldaptor to go along with the TLS patch I 
wrote for twisted.  I am not able to release that patch due to it was 
created by working with another employee.

One thing I would kill to have is the server side of things in twisted.
This would allow me to build the ldap caching daemon / proxy daemon. nscd
on Solaris is a pile of junk, but an absolute need for nsswitch with ldap.  
And just be damn fun to play with.  But I will be damned if I know anyone 
that wants to write it. 

Thank you once again for creating ldaptor, it has save this sysadmin
untold hours of config changes and has been fun to play with.

Hi, people.

I noticed yesterday how heavily Twisted tries to find `plugins.tml'.  Being
new to the game, and not knowing the motivations, a lot of things surely
escape my comprehension, yet at first glance, it looks excessive to me
trying many thousands of disk accesses merely to find a configuration file.

Instead of a long listing followed by a discussion about what could be
spared (like, for example, looking all over in `/usr/bin'), this simple
experiment shows the problem -- if you agree that there is a problem! :-)

That doesn't really make any sense.  Does your employer have some 
ridiculous "we own you" IP contract?

Yes - I have permission (in writing for what i do at home is mine) but
other employees do not (or have not even asked).  And all work done at 
the office is owned wholly by my employer.  There is really nothing 
I can do, I have ask permission to release it back to everyone and was 
denied.  The TLS patch i sent was created at home just for this reason.

I plan on using Twisted for at least a couple of new (from-scratch)

Not yet, but if everything goes according to current plan I should have 
something interesting to share in 6-9 months. ;)

Wow, your job sucks :)  I used to have one of those a few years ago.  I

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted 1.0.4 - Tildes in the book
Message-ID: <oq4r4jdiko.fsf@alcyon.progiciels-bpi.ca>

Hi, still me...

In the Twisted 1.0.4 book -- I hope this reference is unambiguous enough,
I have not seen more than one :-) -- there is a problem here and there with
`~' being shown over the next character (`/' for example) instead of prior
to it as intented.  At many places, tildes are OK, however.  Should I try
reporting all problematic cases?  I guess not, as the problem is likely
to be the same at all places, and some global action could be taken.
The example I'm currently looking at is at the end of page 136 (6. Web
Applications; 6.1.2 Before we begin) on this quote:

   Make sure the `TwistedQuotes' directory is on your PYTYONPATH, put
   `webquotes.rpy' and `WebQuotes.html' in your `~/public_html' directory,
   and you are ready to go.

The `~' and `/' on the last sentence are at the same character position.

I got the same problem, then quickly figured out that I forgot to create
an empty `__init.py__' file within the other files.

But the real reason of this reply is for reporting that the documented:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
   Saving qotd application to qotd.tap...
   Saved.
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

lines are not given in response to calling `mktap'.  Besides that detail,
the example nicely works.  Instead of amending the documentation to
remove those two lines, maybe `mktap' could accept some `-v' option,
server generic, for producing them, and be an opened door for any later
other useful extra feedback?

The thing is, it's not a configuration file :-) It's a plugins file. The point
is for applications to distribute one along with their packages, and just have
it put into their Python package directory, so there's no tricky registration
process required.

Ok.  It is not a configuration file, if you want.  Or this file configures
the plugins, say.  And, I surely understood that the idea of searching so
hard was so the user does not have to say much about where it is.  Granted.

It still looks like Twisted is going overboard with this.  If `plugins.tml'
files were being collected from the top-level directories along `sys.path'
and maybe no more than one-level below, and maybe also for test purposes
(despite the security weakness), into the current directory and one
level of directories below, it would probably make a lot of sense at a
reasonable cost.

But trying every single executable along the shell load path as if the
executable were a directory (yet I understand it would be slower to first
check if it is a directory) is heavy and unlikely to be any fruitful -- at
least in my naive eyes.  It might be worth some revisiting, who knows...
If you really want full generality, it might be more sane and useful to
invent some TWISTED_SEARCH_PATH environment variable, than to go berzerk
and frantically search everything in the wild. :-)

That's exactly what it's documented to do. If it's not doing that, it's a bug.
(btw, the current directory gets no special treatment. If it's searching
the current directory, it's because the current directory is somehow in 
sys.path)

It's not using the shell load path. /usr/bin just happens to be in your
sys.path. And, I'm guessing that explicitly checking 1) whether or not
each item is a directory and 2) whether or not that directory has an 
__init__.py is, as you said, more expensive (and checking for __init__.py
is actually trickier than it seems at first, because you also need to
check for .pyc, .pyo, .pyd, .so....).

And inventing a new environment variable is contrary to the stated goal,
which is the lack of a registration process (apart from what you need to do
to have your package work with Python).

Now, are you actually having a *problem* with the performance of mktap?

Sorry, I misread your paragraph. It's not quite exactly doing that - it's
searching in one *less* place than what you said (directories along sys.path;
it *only* searches one level of subdirectories along each directory in sys.path)

Attached is a patch to twisted.enterprise.row, the sqlreflector, and

databases that require it, such as postgres).

I sent this a while back with a detailed explanation, but have now

detailing some of my changes..

Oh yeh and.. erm.. Itamar told me to re-send on irc a few min ago..

This stuff may need to be cleaned up, and I've considered separating 
some of it out into a PGRow or somesuch, the way that I (and someone

stuff.

Fixed in CVS. For spelling errors, mentioning it on IRC (#twisted
irc.freenode.net) would probably work too. I think I fixed the other
typo you mentioned a few days ago.

2.1 support is now officially dead.

Please don't start changing existing Twisted code to use 2.2 features
unless you're actually adding new functionality. We might need to
backport some code to 2.1 at some point, though that's pretty unlikely.

My feeling is that we should wonder nevertheless.  Consider that, in
actual practice, 1.0.4 was issued with DeprecationWarnings still remaining
for a few servers (conch, parent, sibling), that another server without
arguments raises an exception (inetd).  So we can doubt there was so plenty
of testing, and a unit test for those would add more security to releases.

Because I know :-) The default sys.path isn't there, but your `mktap'
is located in /usr/bin, isn't it? :-)

You probably thought I was being over-assertive because I wasn't explaining
myself fully. I apologize for that. But I did the research, and found out
why this was happening. (more below)

The "Writing Twisted Plugins" section, IIRC.

Trolls like this aren't necessary. If you have a suggestion for improvement
(a special-case for leaving out /usr/bin despite its being in the python
path, for example), then I'll gladly hear it out. But I'm fairly certain
that there's no debate on what the *current* behavior is.

As I stated above, /usr/bin is in your sys.path because that's probably where
your `mktap' is located. If you don't believe me, modify your local Twisted
installation to add a `print sys.path' to twisted.scripts.mktap.

Yeah, I examined the output of that strace that you quoted in your original
mail; I discovered, as I had expected, that /usr/bin was in my python path
because that's where `mktap' is located.

Thanks.  Following your suggestion, I re-installed Twisted 1.0.4 with
the above patches, and reran `admin/runtests'.  The patches apparently
solved a few things.  Without them, the testing summary was:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
FAILED (failures=2, errors=1, skips=3, expectedFailures=2)
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

and now, it is reduced to:

I'm surely a patient man.  Yet, `mktap' could be faster, and nobody
would complain.

And besides and moreover, I may well report a bug, without having an actual
problem with it.  Having to much insist that a bug exists remembers me
the old times of contacting vendors of non-free software.  This is the
second time in the Python community that I observe this phenomenon.
Being receptive to feedback is a good way to keep it coming, you know.

OK then.  I am now reporting a bug.  The default Python path for this
Python 2.2.1, which I installed over a SuSE 8.0 Linux distribution, is:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
>>> sys.path
['',
 '/usr/lib/python2.2',
 '/usr/lib/python2.2/plat-linux2',
 '/usr/lib/python2.2/lib-tk',
 '/usr/lib/python2.2/lib-dynload',
 '/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages',
 '/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/PIL',
 '/sram/griffon/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages']
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

The last line comes from a local `sitecustomize.py'.  The current directory
while testing is:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
~/sram/twisted/web
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

Doing `strace mktap', and cleaning out from the result what is expected
from the current value of `sys.path' (yet without checking if the depth
of search is reasonable), leaves these to consider, explain and justify:

Whoooops!  Since all the mailing list messages I get to OK are spam, I

This is a subtle issue... right now we're going to fix it by 
hard-coding /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin as paths that should not be 
checked, but the real problem is an interaction between Python's 
default path behavior, UNIX's filesystem layout, and the way 
twisted.python.plugins works.

Itamar and I had a few ideas for fixing it "for real" but the caveats 
that we would have to put in the documentation are so ugly that we 
discarded them.  Hard coding '/usr/bin' should fix most cases.

While we were in there, we also removed all paths with a '.' in them: 
since these can't be valid Python packages anyway, it doesn't affect 
its correctness, and it has the benefit of making mktap at least 30% 
faster, even without filtering /usr/bin.

Thanks for bringing 'strace mktap' to our attention.  I'm sure 
everybody will appreciate mktap being much less sluggish :).

It is.  Twisted was installed using `root', and with --prefix=/usr.

I have "3.3 - Writing a New Plug-In for Twisted", and I presume this is what
you are referring to.  I read that section many times, and once more before
sending the above question, and once more now.
The documentation says that:

   Twisted finds its plug-ins by using pre-existing Python concepts;
   the load path, and packages.  Every top-level Python package[4]
   [...] can potentailly contain some number of plug-ins.  [...] The only
   difference between a package and a drop-in is the existence of a file
   named `plugins.tml' [...] that contains some special Python expression
   to identify the location of sub-packages or modules which can be loaded.

This is the most precise description I could find.  Maybe there is a
linguistic barrier (I'm not an English speaker), but to me, this is a
bit generic.  It is not said that plug-ins _are_ `plugins.tml' files, nor
that those TML files are necessarily at the same place the plug-ins are,
(like next to `__init__.py', say), only their existence is asserted.

It is not so clearly stated either that this is a goal that TML files shall
never be themselves registered.  Maybe you could use my naive reading
as a hint that the documentation could be more precise on these points,
as other readers might have the same interpretation difficulties than me.

Hopefully, you'll come to know be better, and discover that I never troll.
I am a peaceful and joyful man, and try to speak in all honesty, always.
Oh, I may tease in a friendly way, but then, there are smileys not far.

> If you have a suggestion for improvement [...] then I'll gladly hear

For now, being a Twisted newcomer that knows very little about it, my
contributions may be timid for a good while.  I'm just sharing the mere
existence of problems I see with my naive eyes, despite I know that in
the area of free software, patches and precise suggestions are usually
quite welcome.  I hope acquiring a bit of competence, and become a better
contributor with the time passing.  Let me apologise for all the false
notes I may sing in the meantime.

I'm quite willing to believe you, you know! :-)

Is Twisted modifying `sys.path' to include the first part of argv[0]?
Or is it standard Python behaviour?  I never noticed this yet in my own
scripts, but it might just have escaped my attention, and I might not know.

Yeah, it's a common misconception about Python, actually. Yes, Python always
adds the location of the main script to sys.path (the misconception is that
people think it's "the current directory" rather than "the location of the main
script", because people so often run their main scripts from the directory
that they're located in.

This is already fixed in CVS :)

Thanks for enlightening me.

For the case of the heaviness for `plugins.tml', at least on Unix, there
might be something we could do that would be reasonable on average,
but I'm not fully sure, I'll merely let judge those who are grown up! :-)

Usually, `/usr/bin/' and such do not have subdirectories, so if a
directory contains 1000 entries, one may immediately check if one of
these is `plugins.tml' by a direct try.  Then, if the number of links of
that directory -- itself -- is exactly 2, we can conclude that it has no
sub-directories, and that there is nothing more to check for this one.
We could then get more speed even for directories other than `/usr/bin/'.

This trick is heavily used in GNU find as a way to avoid `stat'ing all
entries in a directory to find sub-directories, when it can be proven
in advance there is no such sub-directories.  When the trick was added,
the speed-up that resulted was judged spectacular.

But I do not remember if Linux existed at the time.  As Linux seems to
beat many other systems at properly caching disk accesses, the benefits
of the trick might be more hidden.  A year ago, maybe, I tried the same
trick on Linux in hope of increasing the performance of `os.path.walk',
and the speed-up was not so significant.  This is part of my hesitation.

Moreover, maybe the above trick is meaningless on Windows or on MacOS.
I would be surprised if there are Unix filesystems where the link count of
2 for directories (`/' excepted) is not dependable; this might be another
thing to check.  With some luck, GNU find sources would tell us what the
problems may be.  The maintainers surely met them all! :-)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] a problem about running php on twisted?
Message-ID: <20030428004645.8429.qmail@sina.com>

my system is 
window me
python 2.2.2
twisted 1.0.4
php 4.3.1
mysql
phpbb 2.0.4

i want to run phpbb on twisted 1.0.4 under window,
when i installed above software on window xp home edition,it was successful.
but when i installed above software on window me or window xp profession edition,it failed.

Step of my doing is 
1)create dir c:\pydoc and copy c:\python22\doc to c:\pydoc 
  create c:\pydoc\phpbb2 and copy phpbb2 to it

2)edit hello.rpy in c:\python22\scripts and save it in this dir
from twisted.web import static, twcgi

class PHPScript(twcgi.FilteredScript):
    filter = 'C:\\PHP\\php'

resource = static.File("c:\\pydoc")

resource.processors[".php"] = PHPScript

resource.indexNames = ['index.html','index.php']

3)run the command:
  python mktap.py web -p 80 --resource-script=hello.rpy -i index.html,index.php

4)run the command:
  python twistd.py -f web.tap -r win32

After the fourth step ran,i entered into the ie browser and input
http://localhost/   it is ok to show the html.
but while i input http://localhost/phpbb2 ,
it show 500 error. 

why? who can help me to solve it?

Of course, mktap also adds "the current directory" (".") to sys.path.

  If your "twistd" is in /usr/bin, then the '' at the beginning of sys.path
refers to /usr/bin.  It is not at all clear to me that it would be correct
to remove '' from the .tml search path.  It would result in greatly enhanced
mktap performance, but it could also lead to confusing behavior (and the
behavior of .tml searching is more than confusing enough already).

  I certainly wouldn't ;)

  What twisted/python/plugins.py does is not particularly difficult.  Python
makes it difficult to do efficiently (perhaps because it is difficult to do
efficiently in a platform independant way).  If someone with more POSIX-foo
than I could take a good look at what it does, and see if there really is a
portable way we could implement parts of it in C (and maybe get those bits
added to Python itself), that'd be fantastic.

  Thanks again for the bug reports.  Please, keep them coming :)

Message-ID: <200304281219.52777.arashi1@pd.jaring.my>

Hello all,

I'm doing some RnD for eventual migration to a twisted system. I'm not sure 
how 'production' the various bits of twisted are and I'm also not sure how 
all the bits would fit together. 

I'm thinking I'll need:
twisted.web (need to do virtual hosts on with this)
twisted.mail
twisted.names(?)

I think the setup I'm planning is quite common on the net but most people use 
apache and sendmail and something called virtualhostmonster?

Users should not need a unix account - for email, I'm thinking of using a db 
to store their username and passwords and get twisted.mail to check there 
when they try to authenticate to download their emails. Incidentally, would 
mbox or a dbms be better here?

Of course, each website of these users would be on the same machine with the 
same ip. They would have different domains though - with the content of their 
websites stored in (maybe) an rdbms. So:

Bob's homepage would be at:
http://www.bobshome.com

and his email would be: bob at bobshome.net

I would greatly appreciate pointers/tips to achieve this.

	Maildir is better than mbox is better than dbms.

	A Linux box with enough memory should have really good stat
	performance with a hot cache. For /usr/bin, it may be that
	the cache is mostly hot anyway. But even Linux will suffer
	the same performance problems with a cold cache or too little

If I remember well, GNU `find' keeps the link count for a given directory.
Every time it stats an entry which is a sub-directory, it decreases the
link count.  When the link count reaches 2, the loop is exited (provided
`stat' calls are only needed for directory recursion -- `find' sometimes
need them for other purposes).

One may consider that Twisted may also be used on lesser Unices than
Linux -- I'm not going to name any! :-) -- where the performance hit might
hurt more.  As a good rule, I think one should not overly rely on various
systems' disk cache, and be on the parsimonious side while accessing disks.

Possibly lack of reverse DNS on your local network, depending on what
twisted is doing - I could be speaking from my orifice. (If it's trying to
do a reverse lookup, it's timing out in the process, thus appearing to be
slow.)

(If this *is* happening, why is twisted doing the lookup by default?)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Resource.render() returning NOT_DONE_YET
Message-ID: <20030428160935.GA68316@doublegemini.com>

I was just giving a quick Twisted tutorial to someone using
twisted and as we were breaking page construction into more
than one chunk... an unexpected stumbling block occurred --
returning NOT_DONE_YET form the resource's render() function.

I was thinking about two other options:

  1.  Perhaps NOT_DONE_YET could just be None, this 
      way, it can be the default return value.  As I'm
      browsing through my code this is the most common
      return... why not make it the default.

  2.  Alternatively, allow a Deferred to be a return 
      value.  Then the underlying caller can add 
      result.finish() to the deferred chain.   This
      has the advantage of not requiring finish() to
      really be managed.   Either the return value is
      a string, a Deferred, (or for backwards compatibiliy
      NOT_DONE_YET).  In either of the primary cases,
      result.finish() always gets called... thus making
      it easier on newbies.

Ideally, both of the above options could be used...

Best,

Clark

Or, you could just deprecate NOT_DONE_YET and say "if you're doing 
something that uses req.write you need to return a deferred".

For case 1, you return a deferred with an empty rval (None or '').  
This signifies that you took care of req.write.
For case 2, you return a deferred with the page as the rval.  This 
signifies that you want the server to req.write.

I think that's the simplest way, and takes the return values for render 
down to three, but really two for new code:
1) a string
2) a deferred
3) a deprecated NOT_DONE_YET

There are problems with using Twisted/PHP right now. PHP won't work unless you've
compiled it with some special flags for "CGI Support", at least as of one of the
recent PHP versions.

I'm not even sure if PHP support should remain in. Nobody's maintaining it (not
to mention that it's hard to support, apparently), and there are much better
solutions for serving PHP than what Twisted can offer.

> I understand it makes use of the apache module "mod_rewrite"...

I don't know what you're talking about wrt mod_rewrite,  but if you've already
got Apache, you should definitely be using Apache's PHP support with mod_php.

The reasoning behind not allowing None as a default value is that 
forgetting is too easy.  If you're writing a simple request that has a 
render() method that looks like

     def render(self, request):
         if self.authenticated:
             return self.goodies

the default behavior should not be "hang forever".

What if you wanted to start writing the page in the render() method but 
keep writing it later?  Then we have None as a synonym for NOT_DONE_YET 
except in certain situations where you've done something to the request?

I've discussed this with several different people at various times... 
the trouble is, there isn't really a use-case that Deferreds make 
easier.  render() ends up being a relatively low-level interface, and 
the NOT_DONE_YET/write/finish API is quite convenient for the stuff 
that has been implemented with it.

I am definitely a True Believer in the Deferred, but in this case it 
just doesn't seem worth the inconvenience of deprecating things and 
shuffling stuff around for a vanishingly small benefit.

While there is good motivation for not making this public info, it seems 
like it would be a good thing to make this available to someone 
debugging the system, either by way of the log file or some other means.

While not necessarily appropriate for Twisted, one approach that I've 
used well in the past (in my own webserver and web app software) was to 
have an error page that recognized authenticated users and would display 
generic errors to unknown or unauthorized users, and 
informative/descriptive errors to authorized people (as well as direct 
access to the web-based tools used to determine what went wrong and so on).

Maybe some sort of policy framework might let that happen within Twisted 
or some other generalized logging infrastructure.  But at the least, it 
seems like this sort of info should be logged.

Cheers,

  - Bruce

Hi,

I am trying to create an XMLRPC server based on the plugins example in the
HOWTO documentation.  My TAP construction module looks like:

    from twisted.web import server
    from MyXMLRPCServer import methods

    from twisted.python import usage

    class Options(usage.Options):
        optParameters = [["port", "p", 8080, "Port number for XMLRPC Server."],
                         ["ldapurl", None, "ldap://localhost/", "URL for ldap directory server."],
                         ["ldapbinddn", None, "cn=Manager,dc=iu,dc=edu", "Bind DN for directory"],
                         ["ldappw", None, None, "Password for directory Bind DN"]]

        def postOptions(self):
            if self['ldappw'] is None:
                raise usage.UsageError, "Must provide option ldappw"

    def updateApplication(app, config):
        port = int(config['port'])
        factory = server.Site(methods.MyXMLRPCMethods(config))
	 app.listenTCP(port, factory)


 When I run mktap with the appropriate parameters for my application, I get:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/local/bin/mktap", line 30, in ?
        run()
      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/scripts/mktap.py", line 252, in run
        a.save()
      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/internet/app.py", line 754, in save
        dumpFunc(self, f)
      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/internet/app.py", line 736, in dumpFunc
        _dump(obj, file, 1)
    cPickle.UnpickleableError: Cannot pickle <type 'LDAP'> objects

I think I am getting this because my "MyXMLRPCMethods" instance contains a
connection to the LDAP Server.  So what is the best approach to work
around this.  Sorry if this is a newbie question; I am a newbie.

  Don't connect to the LDAP server until your application starts up.  This
may be best done in a Factory's startFactory() method or a Service's
startService method, or hackfully in one of your object's __setstate__
methods.

  mktap is writing a configuration file to disk, not actually running your
app.  So you don't want to set up any runtime stuff, like network
connections, in updateApplication().

Completely agree. Related to this issue, i feel, is what should be best 
practices
for a twisted web application? With all that's available, and little 
imagination,
one can very easily get all tangled up in blue ;)

In view of a site that I have the intention to build, I have been 
trying to select
what best implementation architecture to adopt, looking always for the 
most
stupidly simple. I also want to be able to handle errors as nicely as 
possible
for the users -- meaning I would like to, _whenever_ possible, return a
fully consistent page (and hopefully the one expected by the user) that
provides also the error info, but that would not require the user to do 
anything
more than correct form input data on the _same_ page (without even 
hitting Back
on the browser). I hate the feeling of being surprised with drastic 
error pages,
with all my input data apparently disappeared (also dislike pop-ups 
asking to
repost data, ...). Of course these errors will be of the type 'Ah, that 
one exists
already please try another'... This is all somewhat application 
specific, and
about interfaces, but i feel implementation style can both help or 
hinder this.

A further issue that i find very nagging (at least during development), 
is that
if an error occurs within the presentation layer, the response hangs 
forever.
(These should of course be only development bugs, but i would not like 
to
deliver an app that *may* have presentation bugs yet unknown.) I 
therefore
wrap the call to the real presentation handler in a try/catch. Errors 
in the
business logic are raised to the error handler, so this is not a 
problem. Since I
want my errors to be rendered with a fully functional response, the 
error callback
simply sets the additional response data object, and passes to the
presentation layer (this assumes that the business layer has behaved 
nicely
and attached to request the necessary and sufficient data objects, so 
that
the presentation can render it into a coherent page).

  I am going for this anatomy:


class WebAppPage(twisted.web.resource.Resource):

     def render(self, request):
         request.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8')
         ...
         d = threads.deferToThread(self.businessLogic, request) # to be 
threadpooled ;)
         d.addCallback(self.presentationLogic, request)
         d.addErrback(self.errBack, request)
         return NOT_DONE_YET

   def businessLogic(self, request):
       # uses functionality that is neatly factored in external modules 
;)
       # and attaches the resulting data objects to request in a 
designated
       # container, separate from args (e.g. respargs).
       # Knows no HTML, never calls request.write()

  def presentationLogic(self, result, request, error=None):
     try:
         self._presentationLogic(result, request, error)
     except:
         import sys
         request.write( '''Ooops, error in presentation layer:<p>%s: 
%s</p>'''
                         % ( sys.exc_info()[0], ' -- 
'.join(sys.exc_info()[1].args) ))

   def _presentationLogic(self, result, request, error=None):
       # combines the data objects in args, and result (if any - thus 
may be None)
       # with rendering templates, html, js, css, ...

def errBack(self, error, request):
     self.presentationLogic([],request,error=error)


This suggests that my site's rpy resources should inherit from a 
subclass of resource,
to at least define a common error callback and presentation try/catch 
wrap for the whole
site. However, a small thing escapes me -- how do i guarantee specific 
and automatic
treatment to the request object for all my resources? E.g. setting 
specific headers,
reading cookies/session info, etc., without coding this in every rpy 
instance?

The error handling inherent with Deferred makes it worth it IMHO.  I 
see a lot of NOT_DONE_YET responses fail and it just hangs for the web 
user unless the developer of the function did a lot more work.. a 
deferred could just errback on a failure rather than having to summon 
the web traceback mechanism manually.

I've had two use cases for NOT_DONE_YET they are:

   1.  You've already use req.write() several times followed
       by req.finish()... and then return NOT_DONE_YET.   This is
       confusing usage, primarly beacuse you *are* done.   This
       usage is supported by option #4 above.

   2.  You've setup a async call to finish handling the request,
       and in this case, it makes sence to return Deferred.  In
       this case returning NOT_DONE_YET, and having to call 
       req.finish() is just extra, unnecessary baggage; further,
       default error handling isn't provided when it should be.

NOT_DONE_YET is less than optimal in both use cases where it is used,
both of these cases confused a newbie that I was trying to teach.

Best,

Clark

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Reloading of the same `.rpy' file
Message-ID: <oqk7ddz7pt.fsf@titan.progiciels-bpi.ca>

Hi, Twisted people.

Playing with resource files, I noticed that the outer-level code within
`.rpy' files is executed again every time the page using them is fetched by
the browser.  If `test.py' contains:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
print "Hello!"

...
resource = ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

than each `Alt-R' within Netscape, once `http://localhost:8080/test.rpy' has
been loaded, will have "Hello!" added to the Twisted log file.

I would have expected the resource file to be loaded once, and reused after
without being wholly re-initialised each time.  I tried "import remanent"
within the resource file, and checked that "remanent" is loaded and
intialised only once (moreover, it gets compiled!), so I'm tempted to move
all code from `test.rpy' into `remanent.py' and reduce `test.rpy' to a mere:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
import remanent
resource = remanent.resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

which is a bit ridiculous if it has to be a standard idiom.

On the other hand, for debugging, I agree it is a bit handsome being able to
modify `test.rpy' and trying the new version without restarting the server.
This is a weak justification however.  Whenever the `.tap' file needs to be
rebuilt, the server needs to be restarted anyway.  This soon warrants a
Makefile, and adding another dependency over `test.rpy' is a simple matter.

Maybe the Twisted design is trying, here, to spare memory by not keeping
`.rpy' code in its memory, in case these would be very numerous or contain a
lot of code?  Or trying to protect itself against leaks from such, but how?
I have the vague feeling that I'm missing something important in this area.
Would some soul be kind enough to accept enlightening mine? :-)

I think Zope has the same behaviour. The solution is often to put a
reverse proxy before twisted.web.

Thanks for the pointer, yet I'm not ready to understand it yet.  It seems I
should know `Componentized' first.  Later, hopefully.  I wonder what is the
extent and scope of a `registry'.  Exactly one per `.rpy' file presumably?

Does this explain why, or why not, `.rpy' files are reloaded many times?

I'm at lost here.  What is a reverse proxy in the context of Twisted?
(Could you give me some pointers?)  And how does a reverse proxy (whatever
it is) change the reloading behaviour of Twisted for `.rpy' files?

It doesn't affect .rpy's in any way whatsoever. 

RPYs are designed to be reloaded every time. If you don't want this
behaviour, don't use RPYs - rather, create your Resource tree in memory,
rather than out of the filesystem.

Thanks a lot, William.

Your example (quoted in full below, for reference) has been both useful and
instructive.  I have a question, though.  What is the purpose of `isLeaf'?
It does not seem to be called ever, when I run your example.

Hello, Itamar.  Thanks for replying.

I'm not trying to challenge the design, I'm much too new to Twisted. :-) I'm
just not understanding it.  What are the reasons for reloading `.rpy' files
every time?  There ought to be some advantages, but I'm not seeing them.

No, it merely talks about how to persistize objects...such as your resource.

Why is it ridiculous? The semantics for .rpy are good because they're flexible;
you can either recreate your Resource object every time, or you can cache it.

Also, mind that .rpys are meant to be as tiny as possible; they're just
supposed to be glue code between your web app code and the web server.

Nope, just trying to remain flexible. It gives you a choice between CPU usage
(recreating your Resource every time) and memory usage (keeping your Resources
around in memory between requests).

> Or trying to protect itself against leaks from such, but how?
> I have the vague feeling that I'm missing something important in this area.

Also, IIRC there's some sort of caching mechanism that glyph implemented for
rpys, but I don't remember how it works. IIRC, you just add "cache()" to the
top of your .rpy, or something. Unfortunately, it's not documented as it is.
Can someone comment on this? I'll add some docstrings to ResourceScript
if someone explains it.

In itself, it doesn't, but that caching mechanism I mentioned in my last email
uses it (I just went and read the source in twisted/web/script.py)

And the scope of the registry is one per top-level static.File instance; i.e.,
if you have a web server set up with `mktap web --path foo', then there will
only be one Registry unless you create some static.Files explicitly elsewhere.

It looks like he meant to just say "isLeaf = True". It's expected to be an 
attribute, not a method. It worked accidentally because all function objects
are True.

What isLeaf *does* is to say "Stop looking for more children beyond me".
i.e., this resource will not have `getChild' called on it; it will be
immediately render()ed. You can handle the rest of the path segments by
accessing them through the request object passed to the render method.

...

Oops. 'isLeaf' is a boolean attribute, not a function. It is usually set at
the class level, and overrides t.w.r.Resource's default of '0'. So this class
should really be written as follows:

  class ReportRequest(twisted.web.resource.Resource):
      isLeaf = 1

(the ReportRequest example worked because a bound method happens to be "true"
when evaluated in a conditional. However, it would never have been able to
return "false").

'isLeaf' is a flag tells the server to stop walking through the URL path.
Each slash-delimited component of the URL is put into a list, and the
resource tree is walked (the Site is asked for a child indexed by the first
component, that child is asked for one indexed by the second, etc). If a
child is returned with the .isLeaf flag set, the walk is terminated, and that
child is responsible for dealing with the rest of the path on its own. The
request.postpath array contains the remaining components of the URL.

This is useful when you want to change the resource lookup behavior below
some sub-node of the URL tree. Above the child that sets .isLeaf=1, the usual
Resource.getChild() scheme is used to find a Resource. Below that, the child
can do whatever it wants.

For example, let's pretend that we have a web server which serves users'
~/public_html/ directories, but each user is in a department, and the URL is
always supposed to look like http://foo.com/Department/User/Dir/Subdir/File .
The top two levels of the tree (department and user) must do some kind of
lookup to find out who is in which department and where their home directory
is. The child that is returned by the User lookup would set .isLeaf=1, and
then get the actual file based upon the directory path contained in the
remaining part of the URL. We're basically breaking the URL into two pieces:
[http://foo.com/Department/User], and [Dir/Subdir/File]. The resource tree is
walked with the first part, but the second part is given all at once (as a
list) to the results of the lookup on the first part.

 class MySite(Resource):
  def getChild(self, path, request):
    dept = self.findDepartment(path) # returns a DepartmentResource
    if dept == None:
        return error.NoResource("No such department '%s'" % path)
    return dept

 class DepartmentResource(Resource):
  def getChild(self, path, request):
    user = self.findUser(path) # returns a UserResource
    if user == None:
        return error.NoResource("No such user '%s'" % path)
    return user
  
 class UserResource(Resource):
  isLeaf = 1 # don't call our .getChild(), just do render()
  def render(self, request):
    # rest of URL is in request.postpath
    for p in request.postpath:
      if p == "..": return error.NoResource("naughty naughty")
    filename = os.path.join(self.homedir(), "public_html", request.postpath)
    file = File(filename)
    return file.render(request)


I'm sure there are better examples of isLeaf out there.. this is what comes
to my mind when I see that flag.


cheers,
 -Brian

Sorry if the word offended anyone, it surely was not my intent to do so.

I only meant that if there is really no advantage at reloading an RPY file,
then there is an advantage at loading it only once (unless such RPY files
are so numerous or so big that it would create a memory problem, but it
might likely not be the case in practice), which is avoiding spurious or
useless re-initialisation.  Then, the proper way would be to use a two-liner
for each such file, and having such small bootstraps is questionable.

If a resource was consuming a lot of memory, I would understand.  But as you
just explained, RPY files are meant to be tiny, and then unlikely to build
tons of fresh bytes in Python structures.

Yet, within a small RPY file, one might import from library big modules
having Resource based classes, and resources are meant to be freed
immediately after having been consumed.  For example, such a library
resource might define some big triple-quoted static string holding the
template of an HTML page.  But then, the module will stay imported after the
RPY file disappears, the big string will not be freed, and reloading will
not trigger significant memory savings.  If the template string gets read
from disk each time, it will likely be kept in a local variable in the
`render' method, and will be freed as soon as we exit that method, so
reloading does not in itself trigger memory savings in that case either.

So, just to help me understand, could you illustrate by an example, a likely
case demonstrating the flexibility gained by multiple reloading?

It might be those Registry instances which Moshe referred to in a recent
message, and which are sketched a bit quickly in the book, page 23, (2.3.2
"Using Twisted.Web", section "Resource Scripts").

The two are actually logically the same, but I prefer yours because it puts
off the creation of the NoResource error until it is really necessary. Fixed
in CVS.

Brian and Christopher, let me thank you both for your replies.

I did not find a presentation in the manual (but I'm far from having read it
all yet) about a tree organisation of resources.  Brian's explanation is
quite comprehensive, and in my opinion, should happily find its way into the
current Twisted book.  Is there someone listening, who is taking care of
such things?  We surely have good documentation material in Brian's reply!

     --------------------

I also found, by re-reading various saved messages from the list, that three
of them were especially instructive about the nature and justification of
TAPs, which are:

   2003-02-14 07:42 -0500  Glyph Lefkowitz <glyph at twistedmatrix.com>

   2003-02-11 01:35 -0500  Moshe Zadka <twisted at moshez.org>

all having "In Defense of Taps (was Re: [Twisted-Python] where to begin)"
for a Subject.  Also likely interesting for users is:

In all these messages, and surely others, there is documentation material
that could be retrofitted in the Twisted manual (editing out some unwanted
parts and maybe rephrasing others).  Is there someone, taking care of the
documentation, to whom I should direct a copy of the above (if needed)?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] spawnProcess and environment inheritance
Message-ID: <20030429.142353.133032176.warner@lothar.com>

I wanted to ask what people thought about a potential change to the way
reactor.spawnProcess() sets up the child's environment variables.

The current default is to provide an empty environment to the child:
reactor.spawnProcess() has a env={} default parameter. I'm wondering if this
should be changed to env=None, which would instruct os.execvpe() to let the
child inherit the environment from the parent process.

This showed up in a recent test_process.py failure, which effectively
compared a "file not found" error message obtained with popen3() against a
similar one retrieved with reactor.spawnProcess(). The test failed when it
was run in a localized environment. popen3() inherited $LANG from the parent
(in this case, LANG was set to French), and the error message came out in one
language, whereas spawnProcess() cleared the environment, and the error came
out in English. The two didn't match, so the test harness thought
spawnProcess had somehow failed.

I've changed test_process.py to explicitly pass env=None to all child
processes, but given that Python's popen2 and os.exec library functions all
default to inheritance rather than an empty environment, I'm thinking it
might be a good idea to match them and have spawnProcess() default to
inheritance too.

pros: Less surprise factor for those used to normal unix behavior. Would
reduce the differences between programs run from the shell and those run from
inside spawnProcess.

cons: Sometimes you want to clean the environment as a security measure. The
existing behavior has been around for a while and changing it might cause
problems.

What do you all think?

The change in question, in case you'd like to try it out, would be the
following one-liner:

Send it to the list, or if you think it's too large, post it on a website
somewhere and send the URL to the list.

You are welcome to send it directly to me, but then you'll miss out on feedback

Message-ID: <200304300801.h3U815Q05758@localhost.localdomain>

I kinda suspected that twisted might be slower than asyncore for the
straight go-hell-for-leather usage in pythondirector, but I'd not got
around to actually testing it. It seems like it's nearly 30% slower
than the equivalent asyncore code! This seems a bit higher than I'd
expect -- but given all the extra overhead of object creation I guess
it's not all that surprising. Current CVS python, Twisted 1.0.4.

Has anyone else done similar benchmarking and found different results?
I'm not planning on switching the default back to asyncore - the 
asyncore code is just too brittle for my tastes.

(FWIW, the two equivalent modules are 
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/pythondirector/pythondirector/pydirector/pdnetworktwisted.py?only_with_tag=HEAD
and 
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/pythondirector/pythondirector/pydirector/pdnetworkasyncore.py?only_with_tag=HEAD
)

A wiki could be ideal for this... examples and documentation draft.

I post two times my example, and it's the first time somebody correct it,
if i didn't look at the list (i'm very busy now) i could post the
mistake again...
Maybe somebody will look in the archive and use my first post with the
mistake !

A wiki would probably be just as bad -- if people aren't looking in the list
archives for unreplied to patches, they won't check the wiki either, and
things would get lost.

The current recommended strategy is to post to the list, maybe post a
reminder (like you just did... thanks! :), and finally, if we still haven't
responded, add it to our bug tracker on SourceForge, so we won't forget it
for eternity.

Pestering random developers on IRC can work well, too, but that can require
a fair bit your time to make that work :)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] mktap dns is broken if you switch subnets
Message-ID: <20030430160159.GA28522@lapdog>

	Hi. Lately, I've been playing with using "mktap dns" as a
	resolver for my laptop. Except, it's making me angry.

	It doesn't reload resolv.conf. My resolv.conf nameserver list
	is changed by DHCP about twice per day, atleast.

	In fact, it even loads the resolv.conf only in __init__, so
	the list gets stored in the tap file. I need to mktap, tap2deb
	and dpkg -i whenever I switch subnets!

	Here's a quick-and-stupid patch that makes it reload
	resolv.conf regularly, currently made to reread it every
	minute. This is "close enough". Actually, I want to make
	it get a notification from somewhere..

	I definitely want this implemented. Please tell what direction
	should I go with the patch, and what do you think is missing
	from "production quality"?

Message-ID: <1051723673.639.18.camel@mingus>

Hi folks,

In order to really get NNTP and SMTP (securely) integrated with Hep I
need to get authentication working.  Both of these protocols support
authentication, although it's not required by the core RFCs.  But as far
as I can tell neither of the modules in twisted/protocols supports
authentication at the moment.

Is anyone working on this already?  If not, I'd like to do it myself,
and I'd appreciate some help in understanding the 'right' way to
implement authentication in Twisted.  I've been looking at J.P.'s IMAP4
work in CVS, and I can see he's using identities and perspectives
(although I don't have a complete understanding of how these work).  Is
the use of twisted.cred preferred?  Other drivers, such as POP3, don't
seem to use it...

Thanks,

Abe

  If you don't get to it first, I may end up doing SMTP authentication
sometime in the near future (as I have need for it as well).  I hadn't given
much thought to NNTP.

  I think POP3 should be updated to use cred in a manner similar to that
which IMAP4 uses it.  Since I wrote IMAP4, obviously I think that is the
right way to do authentication ;) (modulo one thing - the actual
challenge/response verification should be factored out and away from the
Identity class - I believe itamar and glyph have discussed this and have
some ideas for the implementation).

  Whether the *actual* details of how IMAP4 is using cred are proper are
not, I don't know ;) The code works, but it seems that there are too many
different objects involved in the process (CramMD5Identity,
CramMD5ServerAuthenticator, CramMD5ClientAuthenticator - and that's just for
*one* kind of authentication scheme).  Setup is similarly tedious, requiring
4 lines of "boilerplate" to set things up, and then *10* lines to add each
new identity.  Now that imap4.py is settling down, it'd be great if someone
with more experience with cred could take a look at it and give me some
feedback.

  Maybe there will be a coil for cred someday so you can keep this part of
the code out of your actual app, though.  If so, this is one of the real
strengths of cred.  Your app doesn't have to do anything to manage user
accounts, you just attach the cred coil and you're done.


  Hope this helps,

  Jp

  It would be great if Twisted could speak FAM.  I looked briefly at
integrating the python wrapper, but didn't have time to go very in-depth.

  It basically looks good.  One thing I'd like done differently is to have
parseConfig() called at a different time.  Possibly calling it as a result
of connectionMade() further increases an already large latency on queries. 
If this were done in a callLater() loop, this would keep the parsing
overhead out of the path of actual queries the client performs.

  As a short term solution, I think this is reasonable (but the point is
moot if we wrap and use libfam).  How's it sound to you?

I'll make a deal with you - if you do SMTP authentication (demonstrating
the 'right way to do it'), I'll write a similar patch for NNTP :-)

That would be nice.  It seems like there's also the potential to share
the code for different methods of authentication between
POP3/SMTP/IMAP/NNTP - I think they all can use CRAM-MD5, for example,
and it seems silly to duplicate the code in each protocol.

	Well, it'll need a secondary mechanism anyway, as FAM
	is far from portable.

	Besides, FAM is a daemon. The actual kernel interface
	it uses is called "dnotify", and it goes like this:

fd = open(".", O_RDONLY);
fcntl(fd, F_SETSIG, SIGRTMIN);
fcntl(fd, F_NOTIFY, DN_MODIFY|DN_CREATE|DN_MULTISHOT);

	and you'll get an SIGRTMIN every time the dir changes. Allocating
	an available signal sounds like this is something that should first
	be "twistedified", and not used raw.

	This might not even need any C wrapping, or at most exposing
	those DN_* and F_* constants.

	If you really want to use that API, and the DN_* constants
	aren't exported by standard python, it'd be trivial to add
	them to eunuchs. And fall back to statting the file every
	once in a while if eunuchs isn't installed or the kernel
	doesn't understand the fcntl.

	Yeah, sure. I ended up doing it that way just because I couldn't
	remember whether callLaters etc are pickled or not, and make it
	resume from a .tap correctly, etc..

	Okay, how about I make it check the file timestamp every n seconds
	via callLater, and commit that? Maybe tomorrow.

This is why cred is going to be refactored. With a chainsaw. On fire.
End result should be that you have to do a *lot* less work in your
protocol.

Personally, I find FAM's implementation annoying, because is uses sunrpc, and
requires the "security-compromise-waiting-to-happen" portmap daemon be
running. I wish they had implemented it with a unix socket instead, but it
appears to be aimed at handling remote (NFS) directory changes as well as
local ones. Something less server-heavy would seem more appropriate.

The Linux mechanism is DNotify, and you can get at most of the functionality
from the Python side. I have code in the BuildBot (buildbot.dnotify) which
does the necessary Twisted glue, and I'd be happy to contribute that if it
seems useable. Code is available from http://buildbot.sf.net .

One problem with that module is that DNotify uses SIGIO (or other signal of
your choice) to indicate the change, and Python's signal-delivery code
doesn't pass the siginfo_t argument to the Python handler, which means
multiple DNotify notifications for the same process all look the same.

That buildbot code also falls back to polling every 10 seconds if the DNotify
fcntl values aren't available (e.g. non-linux).

Your patch looks reasonable to me.

So you are thinking of factoring out the case sensitive relations code?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted 1.0.4 - NameVirtualHost and isLeaf
Message-ID: <oqu1cfleih.fsf@titan.progiciels-bpi.ca>

Hi, people.

Thanks to the recent explanations about `isLeaf', I was able to figure out
that if, with Twisted 1.0.4, I was unable to get virtual hosts to work, this
was because the `isLeaf' attribute of an instance of `vhost.NameVirtualHost'
is not True.  At least with the setup I use.  the instance's `render' method
is not called then, and consequently, the dispatching to the proper resource
does not occur.

In what circumstance would it be useful that such an instance has `isLeaf'
set to False?  I presume this might help me better understand resources.

Someone will surely correct me if I'm wrong, but I ran into this same
dilemma when I began to use twisted.  It seems that as twisted is an
event-driven framework for asynchronous networked applications, it isn't
intended to be used in this way.

Twisted applications should generally sit around waiting for requests,
and respond to them in a timely, but non-blocking manner.  Starting up,
doing some stuff, and exiting, just doesn't seem to be the idiom at play
here.

YMMV..

You don't want a reactor.crash() and a reactor.stop(). Just do
reactor.stop().

Using threads can make your python program not exit if they hang around,
but reactor.stop() should shut down all threads in the thread pool.

Dunno what you mean by "this way". If you need to deal with a blocking
database operation you dispatch it to the thread pool, and that works
just fine.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] supressess warnings
Message-ID: <96CF4C0E-6439-11D7-8A58-000393C92466@dalkescientific.com>

I'm just starting to learn how to use Twisted.  My first project
is to write a simple XML-RPC server.  I started with the demo,
and that worked fine.

I then added an import statement for the module I need.

from openeye.oechem import *

Now, this uses a shared library extension which was built
for Python 2.2, and I'm running a CVS version of Python 2.3,
so I usually get

/usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages/openeye/oechem.py:5:  
RuntimeWarning: Python C API version mismatch for module _oechem: This  
Python has API version 1012, module _oechem has version 1011.
   import _oechem

However, that didn't happen when I started my my simple
server.  I got no warning message.  I started to worry that my
file system wasn't properly saving files!  I played around with
the imports, and moved that import to be above the twisted
ones, and it started reporting the warning.

A bit of searching later and I found
   twisted/python/log.py
which redefines (!) warnings.showwarning to dump the data to a
logfile, which is initialized to a NullFile(), which does nothing.

So the twisted code is throwing some (potentially useful) diagnostics.

Doing a search I found the commit statement
http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-commits/2002-October/ 
003975.html
 > 2) implemented a custom warning handler; now warnings look sexy.
 >   (the hackish overriding of warnings.showwarning is the recommended  
way to

I'll grant that's what the docs say.  However, why is the logfile for
showwarnings initialized to NullFile, and not to sys.stderr?

For that matter, I think it's better to delay replacement until  
startLogging
is called.

Hmm, and why is os.linesep used in the logging?  The log
file should have been opened in text mode, in which case "\n"
will get translated to the proper os-dependent form.


I started to change the code, so I could submit a patch.  I got the
code out of CVS and am reading the documentation at
   http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/coding-standard
It says that the main test suite builder is in 'twisted.test.test_all'

That module doesn't exist (can't import it) nor is the appropriate
file present anywhere.  And the hyperlink from that page yields
   "No Such Resource
    File not found."

It then says
   Acceptance tests are all automated by the bin/accepttests
but that program is in admin/accepttests

I ran that for my Mac OS X machine, with 'open' as the
WEBBROWSER setting (where does the '-b' option go, since
open doesn't block .. do I pass it to 'accepttests'?  Yes.) and  
/bin/true
as my IRCCLIENT, since I wouldn't know what to do with one
even assuming I had one.

Anyway, after a while it gave this error

So I tried to rewrite the code given that it looks like the self-tests
run reasonably well, but then ran into complications with this bit of  
code

# Make sure we have some basic logging setup.  This only works in  
cpython.
try:
     logOwner
except NameError:
     logOwner = LogOwner()

     ...

# Prevent logfile from being erased on reload.  This only works in  
cpython.
try:
     logfile
except NameError:
     logfile = NullFile()
     logerr = sys.stderr


Okay, so we've got some code duplication here, and comment
skew.  I've fixed that up, and tidied up a few other bits of the code.
And for the life of me I can't figure out why the log file should
default (when no logging is enabled) to the NullFile rather than
sys.stderr -- if you really want the NullFile, just pass it in.  So
I switched it to use sys.stderr.

I then reran the 'admin/runtests' script and got ... some warnings
and comments which were being supressed.

Also, I removed those os.linesep references, and the os module,
and the needless string module.  And turned 'file_protocol' into
'_file_protocol' since it's for internal use only.

Why's the Log pickleable? What happens if a cStringIO is passed
in instead of a file?  Or an outgoing network socket?  Or a
os.popen("lp")?

It looks like Log.synchronized is old code that can be removed.  Yes?

Why does doc/examples/cursesclient.py set log.logfile directly?
Shouldn't it call log.startLogging(log.NullFile()) ?  It's the only  
other
piece of code which references log.NullFile.

Is 'discardLogs' the true inverse of startLogging?  If so, it
should add something to restore sys.stdout/sys.stderr if
startLogging asked them to be changed.

If not, where's the 'stopLogging' function?  And 'discard'
means to ignore logging?  Or should it throw away the
log files?  The terminology is confusing.

Anyway, the diff -u is attached for you all to review and
correct.

Do you mean PB+SSL?

If so, the support for it (pb.connectSSL, or whatever the function is
called) is broken, IIRC. Sorry. I might have a reason to fix it soon,
however.

If you *do* mean PB+SSH, I have no idea what you mean.

Fixed in CVS - warnings will be logged to stderr if no log file was
specified.

Running admintests correctly is hard - I've never gotten the web distrib
tests to pass. In general these tests are more for the release manager
than for end users.

Probably not.

Basically, Twisted logging starts out with all log.msg() messages being
discarded, and exceptions, errors and in CVS warnings, logged to stderr.
startLogging() will set it so all messages get logged to the specified
file-like object.

Yeah, replacing showwarnings is the idiomatic way to override the
display of warnings. The bit that initializes the default logfile to
NullFile is something moshez and glyph wanted, and, for the record,
something I'm against. (sorry glyph :-)

Oh, that's a bit out of date. Just run `./bin/trial -p twisted.test'
if you want to run all of the Twisted tests. I'll update the doc.

Note that all developers aren't really expected to run these, it's
super-dependant on your environment and is finicky about how exactly
you start the script. I'll add this to the doc, as well.

Oh, it seems itamar just fixed those issues with the coding standard.

Yeah, `admin/runtests' just runs `bin/trial -p twisted.test', for

I wish this could be accepted, but unless glyph changes his mind, it
probably won't. The usual response is to use twistd, but twistd isn't
appropriate in all use-cases (it is in yours, however). The *reason*,
IIRC, was that "you shouldn't spam unwanted stuff to STDIO", which I
think is stupid. Application developers could notice spam to stdio,
and, if they don't like it, startLogging to NullFile. (I've heard a
lot more complaints about "Why don't I see any output!?" than "Why
does Twisted write stuff to my stdio?")

</rant>

Sorry, I guess I'll stop beating a dead horse. :)

Well, it should probably be pickleable only when it _can_ be. :) i.e.,
__getstate__ could test for a `.name' attribute on the file object, or
something. Handling stuff like StringIO might be a bit trickier
without hardcoding an `isinstance(self.file, StringIO)' into
it... Perhaps it could `try: cPickle.dumps(self.file)' to test if the
file's pickleable in the case where it's not a named file ;-)

> It looks like Log.synchronized is old code that can be removed.  Yes?

No, I'm pretty sure this is so threaded code that writes to the log
doesn't break.

Well, if you want to switch your logging to something else
(sys.stdout/stderr), then pass that something else to startLogging,
probably.

Well, no, usually people use twistd. Which you should, if you're
writing a server. It handles logging, daemonization, and a whole slew
of other things for you, and, contrary to what most people think,
doesn't require the use of .taps (see the `-y' parameter).


Anyway, thanks for the in-depth message, it was helpful.

Ok, so apparently I had forgotten that glyph *did* agree to log errors
and warnings to STDIO, but when he implemented the change it didn't
work. Sorry, glyph :) Itamar just checked in a fix so stuff gets
logged to stderr. Hooray!

The reason that moshez and I have it written this way is simple: we 
don't want library code generating spurious messages that your code may 
not want printed.  However, I think that you're correct in criticizing 
it for throwing away warnings and tracebacks.  Errors, even in library 
code, ought to be presented the same way they're normally presented.

As long as we're talking about sys.std*err*, and not std*out*, I think 
this is acceptable.  I'd like to hear if moshez's has any objections 
too, but barring that, let's do it immediately.

This should be a FAQ.

	Q.  Is using 'twistd' always appropriate?

	A.  Not always, but it is in your case.

Oh, I heard a lot of complaints about it writing spurious messages to 
stdio before this change was made.  Different people are unhappy, but 
people are unhappy either way :-)

Mmm, okay, I see the patch you did in CVS.

One thing I don't like about the log system is that it goes
into place on import, rather than after some explicit request
to actually use the log.  It isn't obvious anywhere that that
import will make a system level change.
   - what if I've changed warnings.showwarning in my own
        code (or in some other 3rd party package).  Where's the
        documentation which states that there will be a problem?

   - It's pervasive.  That is, if I import twisted.lore (perhaps
       because I want it to use it for my own documentation
       system) it's still the case that warnings.showwarning
       gets replaced.  There should be no reason for that.

Are there any other system-level functions or settings which
get tweaked by Twisted?

 > > It looks like Log.synchronized is old code that can be removed.   
Yes?

 > Probably not

Ahh, I see.  It's emulating the Java keyword.  Hmm, I probably
would have had a Log implementation which changed depending
on of this was threaded or not, and have threaded calls forward
the write/writeline via a Queue.

There are only 4 places which use that, outside of some of the
test code.  Is it really that useful given how non-obvious it is?

Also, I see that the other places which use a class with the
synchronized attribute (like web/static.py) also call  
threadable.synchronize
on the class, as in

python/logfile.py:threadable.synchronize(LogFile)
test/test_threadpool.py:threadable.synchronize(Counter)
test/test_threads.py:threadable.synchronize(Counter)
web/static.py:threadable.synchronize(FileTransfer)

Notice that log.py's Log class, which has a 'synchronized'
attribute, is not so initialized.  This suggests there's either a bug
(this class needs to be synchronized) or that that attribute is
unneeded.

Christopher Armstrong:
 > The bit that initializes the default logfile to NullFile is
 > something moshez and glyph wanted

Actually, I don't care where the default logfile goes, I just
care where my system warnings go.  But as you pointed out
in a later email, it's now sent to 'STDIO'.

I still don't like that it goes into effect without me doing
anything other than an import.

 > I have no idea what this error means.

Looking only at the error message, it means that:
   - the option parsing code does automatic prefix expansion, so
        that if the option is '--pop3' and the argument is '--pop' and no
        other option starts with '--pop' then it's elided to '--pop3'.   
This
        was what DEC machines did for VMS commands (as I recall)
        and it was annoying because if a new option is added (like
        '--popcorn') then scripts which assumed that '--pop' would
        always be unique, broke.

   - and a new option was added which started with the '--pop'
        prefix, breaking the code.

   - and no one has run those tests in a while, probably not since
      10-Feb-03 when moshez added the following option.

        ["pop3s", "S", 0, "Port to start the POP3-over-SSL server on (0  
to disable)."],

Again, I realize this has been changed.  Just wanted to note
that system warnings about API differences are wanted, as well
as warnings about deprecations, etc.

That didn't answer my question of why it needs to be pickled.
I suppose it's part of the App, which saves complete state via
a pickle?  Err, it can't, because that's a module variable.

In any case, the cleaner way to fix it is to have a specialized
replacement called instead of the native open call, and
have it store the arguments so that the unpickling gets the
correct calls, and allow backwards compatibility with
   if isinstance(logfile, file):
     logfile = PickleableFile(logfile)

I'm just working my way through the example, and it doesn't
use twistd, so I didn't.

As mentioned, I don't like how system settings are changed
on an import, much less without documentation which says
this will happen.

If everything server related should be done in the context
of twistd, then that warnings.showwarning replacement
should only be done when twistd is used, which is why
the patch I sent only made the switch when startLogging
was called.

The solution I see now, which is that showwarnings calls
the errlog instead of the msg log, still isn't the right
behaviour, IMO, if only because you are changing the
format of the error messages.  At the very least you should
call warnings.formatwarning instead of building your own
warning message.

Oh, and the code should be that if file is not None, to
use the file handle passed in to showwarnings, and not
the error log, that is, replace twisted/python/log.py from

def showwarning(message, category, filename, lineno, file=None):
     err('''\
WARNING: %s::
%s
file: %s; line: %s
''' % (category, indent(message), filename, lineno))

to

def showwarning(message, category, filename, lineno, file=None):
     m = warnings.formatwarning(message, category, filename, lineno)
     if file is None:
       err(m)
     else:
       file.write(m)

Finally, I noticed that other part of my patch were not accepted.
For example, the use of os.linesep is incorrect.  The log file is
opened in text mode, so "\n" will be converted to the appropriate
byte representation for the given platform.  In other words,

         logerr.write(str(stuff)+os.linesep)
should be
         logerr.write(str(stuff)+"\n")

I also did some things to clean up the code, like getting
rid of unneeded module imports (like string) and replacing

import cStringIO
  ...
StringIO = cStringIO
del cStringIO

with

import cStringIO as StringIO

I noticed none of these were accepted.

What should I do to make these sorts of changes more acceptable?
After all, the point of a good unit test suite is to make it easy for
people to refactor and clean up existing code.  All the tests passed
identically before and after my changes.

I could, for instance, have split up the patch into several parts.
However, part of what I did was to replace the warnings.showwarning
code only once, which required a test against a reload (as is
done in two other parts for the code) so I moved those into a
single change and fixed the comments for why it was done.

Yes, they only get run during releases. Jean-Paul fixed the --pop issue
in CVS I think.

Some of the failed tests look like timing issues, yes.

Gar. I wonder why this isn't showing on the Max OS X buildbot.

Typo - fixed in CVS.

Any bugs we can reproduce and are easily fixable will be fixed by next
release, e.g. the dom one.

The idea was to have more informative messages. Can you put in something
comparing the two formats?

Not really, I just didn't get around to reading the patch. I did some of
these in CVS.

They were not bad, it seems, we just don't have time to deal with all of
them... I have a huge queue waiting for me :(

We do appreciate your efforts.

Yes, but behaviour was changed I think? Possibly in a better way, but
changing behaviour takes more mental work on our part.

I think it's useful to have a callAt function in the reactor.  Itamar 
mentioned that one of the design goals of the reactor is to have a 
minimal interface.  However, IMHO it should be added to IReactor due to 
the utility (log rotation, scheduled events, etc.) of such a 
convenience function and the fact it takes a newbie a lot longer to 
find something hidden away in a utils package (for example, today, 
neither Itamar nor I knew that there was a function in t.i.utils to 
start a process and return a Deferred with the stdout of that 
process!).  The implementation is very simple, it looks like this:

     def callAt(self, when, f, *args, **kw):
         """See twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorTime.callAt.
         """
         return self.callLater(max(0.0, when - time()), f, *args, **kw)

Well, I was the one who made this change, and there's no particular
philosophical reasons behind it. I agree moving it to twistd would be
good.

I'm a new developer in twisted. I want test twisted writing an ftp server.

Can anyone indicate an example or doc for developing ftp server? In twisted
distribution I didn't find it.

Thanks

mm.. because twisted already has an ftp server? see module

	twisted.coil.plugins.ftp

(just guessing from the API, never used coil myself.)

Yes, there is an ftp server.

In API docs:

....
Package twisted :: Package protocols :: Module ftp :: Class FTP

An FTP server.
....

...
twisted.tap.ftp

I am the support module for making a ftp server with mktap.
....

....
twisted.coil.plugins.ftp

Coil plugin for FTP server.
...


but I can't find any examples, or how-to, or implementation reference.

twisted.protocols.ftp has code for a FTP server that serves files from
the filesystem. It's not pluggable, and needs a lot of work, but it
could be used as a basis for a cleaned up refactored server.

Or, you could skip FTP (it's a really sucky protocol) and build a WebDAV
server instead.

Usage and behaviour of a PullProducer isn't clear to me.  Does
PullProducer.resumeProducing mean that it should call consumer.write
exactly once?  Or is the amount of times consumer.write will be called
undefined or context-dependent but merely guaranteed to be finite?

A PushProducer delivers an undefined quantity of data to consumer.write
some unknown time after resumeProducing is called.  A PullProducer
delivers an undefined quantity of data to consumer.write some unknown
time after resumeProducing is called.  So why two interfaces?  Why don't
pulling consumers just use pauseProducing upon getting a .write?[1] 
Then we can ditch one of the interfaces and the 'streaming' argument to
registerProducer and the conditionals that go with it...

If it is a different interface, can we give the method a different
name?  I think it strange that you call "resume" on these when producing
has never been "paused".  And that "resume" in this case does not signal
a return to an ongoing process from which it has been interrupted, but
is a single  request for a discrete amount of data.  A name beginning
with "get" or "next" seems more fitting.

 - Kevin


[1] "...just use pauseProducing upon getting a write()?": One answer to
that could be "it's more message traffic"; every write in a
pull-producer implemented on PushProducer this way would involve
p.resume();c.write();p.pause() as opposed to just p.resume();c.write(). 
But that alone doesn't convince me the interface confusion is worth it.

Yes, but it's there for historical reasons...

Idon't think the two interfaces should be merged - they are different in
intent and usage.

This is also similar to the 'flow' module by Bob Ippolito (etrepum)
and somewhat distantly related to my flow module; only that mine is
more 'push' like.  Both are attempts at bringing an async 
producer into play, where the producer could at any time block.

Message-ID: <E190cRJ-0003PJ-00@pyramid.twistedmatrix.com>

It is often convenient in protocol implementations to just .read() as
much as you want to. However, it is impossible in Twisted, becase .read()
is a blocking operation. Happily, we can make blocking operations seem
non-blocking with the use of deferred. The following protocol does just
that:

class ReadProtocol(protocol.Protocol)

    toRead = 0
    until = ''

    def rawDataReceived(self, data):
        pass

    def dataReceived(self, data):
        while data:
            if self.toRead:
                read, data = data[:self.toRead], data[self.toRead:]
                self.buffer.write(read)
                self.toRead -= len(read)
                if self.toRead == 0:
                    self.deferred.callback(self.buffer.getvalue())
                    self.buffer.close()
            elif self.until:
                idx = data.find(self.until)
                if idx == -1:
                    self.buffer.write(data)
                    data = ''
                else:
                    read, data = data[:idx], data[idx:]
                    self.until = ''
                    self.buffer.write(read):
                    self.deferred.callback(self.buffer.getvalue())
                    self.buffer.close()
            else:
                self.rawDataReceived(data)
                data = ''

    def readUntil(self, c):
        self.toRead = 0
        self.until = c
        self.buffer = StringIO()
        self.deferred = defer.Deferred()
        return self.deferred

    def connectionMade(self):
        self.readString()

    def readString(self):
        self.readUntil(':').callback(
        lambda s: self.readLength(int(s)).callback(
        self.stringReceived).callback(
        lambda _: self.readLength(1).callback(
        lambda x: x==',' or self.transport.loseConnection()).callback(
        lambda _: self.readString))

I'm pretty sure startLogging is called at some point on import? Or how

I suspect it will be waaaaaaaay slower than the equivalent netstring

Just to bring generators back up..  Note that of course, the wrappers 
for read and the actual flow.BufferedProtocol class don't exist.. but 
their implementation is possible with the given syntax.
I'm imagining that a "flow" version of Int32Receiver could be coded 
like this:

class NetstringProtocol(flow.BufferedProtocol):
	def connectionMade(self):
		pass

	def handleConnection(self):
		self.connectionMade()
		reason = None

		# the string receive loop
		while 1:
			# read int32, size of int32 is 4
			result = self.read(4)
			yield result
			if result.isFailure():
				reason = result.get()
				break
			strlen, = struct.unpack('!I', result.get())
			if strlen <= 0:
				endFailure = Failure(ValueError('Zero length strings are not 
valid'))
				break
			# read string
			result = self.read(strlen)
			yield result
			if result.isFailure():
				reason = result.get()
				break
			self.stringReceived(result.get())

		# exception caused connection to drop, or connection dropped on its 
own
		self.connectionLost(reason)

	def connectionLost(self, reason):
		pass

The twiddling of warnings is done during import, and the
logfile is set to NullFile.  The code looks like this (including
the indentation level)

import warnings
warnings.showwarning = showwarning
   ....
# Prevent logfile from being erased on reload.  This only works in 
cpython.
try:
     logfile
except NameError:
     logfile = NullFile()
     logerr = sys.stderr


The patch I submitted changes matters so that twiddling
doesn't occur until startLogging is called.

I'm new to Twisted, so please forgive me if this is obvious.  I read the

relevant.

I would like to use a protocol with SOCKS.  For example, ircLogBot.py calls
reactor.connectTCP().  How would I make it connect through SOCKS?  If
Twisted does not currently have this functionality, how would I go about
implemented it the correct way?

I notice from expirmentation that reactor.stop() seems to sever any ongoing
network connections.  Is there a way to temporarily stop then restart the
reactor without losing a network connection?  Or would I need to write my
own reactor?

I'm writing unit tests, where I want to script a sequence of events.
Currently I have a (pyui) loop calling twisted.internet.main.iterate(), and
have my code accept a startup flag telling it whether to stop for procederal
input after remote PB calls.

This is a bit awkward, and so I'm hoping someone has dealt with this before
in twisted.

I notice that there is a "newjelly.py" in twisted.spread, which appears to
have changed the code relavent to the error I was getting.  However, I
couldn't easily tell from the commit email whether this was finished, or how
one would use it...

Am I correct in guessing newjelly.py is intended to be renamed to jelly.py,
but isn't ready yet?

PS  I've got a kludge to the 1.03 jelly.py and flavors.py that avoids the
"storing a _Derefence into a __dict__" error I was getting.  If anyone's
interested I can post it, although there would be little point if newjelly.py
will be ready soon.

Yes, I have tested it also, and needed the activeState solution. Some

Yes, It's similar to the flow module. I 've seen the source in sandbox on 
cvs, flow will be very usefull in network processes (like treatments on 
database results). Please finish it !

The way you use it is by replacing the imports at the top of pb.py and 
flavors.py to say "import jelly as newjelly" or "from newjelly import 
...".  Please do this and see if your problem is solved.  (better yet, 
contribute a unit test so we can make sure future changes don't break 
this either...)

The real issue is that this is a protocol-breaking change, and we're 
not quite prepared to deal with the fallout from that.  Brian Warner 
and I hacked on this at PyCon, and he has some ideas for backwards 
compatible version negotiation, so we may want to keep the old 
implementation around anyway.  When we figure out if and how we're 
going to do backwards compatibility, we'll make the changeover.

Also, the idea behind this implementation was to simplify things so 
that some new kinds of optimizations are possible -- the implementation 
is still really grotty (though it should be functional; I've made the 
aforementioned change to my pb.py and flavors.py and the PB unit tests 
pass), and I want to make sure that these optimizations *are* actually 
made possible, and we haven't just shuffled things around for no reason 
:-)

I just took the shortcut of replacing jelly.py with newjelly.py, as I didn't
want to hunt down imports to change.  I got several errors, and hence
wondered if it was finished, e.g.

I get this Traceback when sending from Perspective -> Client
...
  File "...jelly.py", line 536, in _unjelly_tuple
    if preTuple.resolvedObject is None:
exceptions.AttributeError: _Tuple instance has no attribute 'resolvedObject'

After this error I get a similar error (when sending from Client ->
Perspective) where a local variable that is set on my Perspective before
calling a "remote" client method is later missing when the client calls a
"perspective" method.

I haven't looks more closely than this though.


I posted a test case demonstrating the "circular ref" bug a couple of
messages up this thread, but didn't work out a unit test.  I'll try to get
some time to do that, although I understand twisted uses something other than
pyunit so I'm not sure what's involved.

A cursory glance at newjelly.py makes me think it can't possibly have the
same problem, as "references" and "derefences" now seem to be treated in the
same manner, and presumably your unit tests cover simple references. ;-)

Isn't all the Jelly/Unjelly code pretty well encapsulated, so that others
needed really care how it works internally?

For what it's worth (after a cursory glance), the reference/dereference
cleanup part of your changes looks like a clear improvement, but in
understandability and correctness. :-)

1. Never ever use twisted.internet.main. Please. It is waaaay
deprecated.

2. You can use reactor.iterate().

3. For unittesting, reactor.crash() does exactly what you want - stop
reactor without closing anything.

First thing I notice is that the introductory demo doesn't work, because
twistd.py won't run as a script (it has no "if __name__ == '__main__':
run()").  I obviously could fix that, but it seems so basic that I worry
that I'm just missing something (like I'm not supposed to be using the
scripts in /scripts directly).

Next question is what happened to support for a FieldStorage-like api in the
protocols.http.request module?  Googling shows that 0.99.3 had it, but 1.03
doesn't.  Is it coming back, or to be replaced by something else?  I'd like
it for file uploads in a very simple web-based photo album, to share some
family shots.

Thanks in advance for the help, and again, great job at PyCon.

In my unit tests I often do the following.

You're not supposed to be using the scripts in site-packages/*/scripts
directly.  I'm told the Windows installer puts the runnable scripts in
something like C:\Python22\scripts\twistd.py

Happy twisting,

It was in, but had to be taken out since it broke other code. Eventually
it will return - meanwhile you can still access the same data, just less
efficiently using existing APIs.

The files in twisted/scripts are not the ones you want to run... you need
to run the ones that were installed under c:\python22\scripts, or wherever
they go on your own machine.  Those basically do an imported from the 
twisted.scripts.xxx modules and call xxx.run(), so it amounts to almost
the same thing.

FieldStorage, as in the cgi module?  What don't you like about the request.args
field that is nicely parsed for you from the HTTP GET or POST request?  (Note
that the fields all come in as lists, so if you expect only one instance of
any given field you need to grab request.args['fieldname'][0] to get the
actual string value.)

I'm a rookie at Twisted, but I've just "been there" on both issues... good
fodder for a tutorial/FAQ I suppose... or a wiki.

reactor.crash is better for tests since you can call reactor.run again
afterwards.

  We use twisted.trial, which presents an interface that's almost identical
to pyunit, so if you're familiar with one, working with the other should be
fairly easy.

  That said, I've added a TestCase to test_jelly.py that seems to tickle
this bug. :)  It's simplified even more from your example, but I think it
still catches the essense of the problem.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] What's twistd doing on Windows?
Message-ID: <3E8CB2A2.5010908@norfolkgraphics.com>

Hi all,

First of all I wanted to say thanks to all the Twisted guys that gave 
talks at PyCon 2003.  I was going to use Zope for an upcoming project, 
but the demos you all gave made me think that Twisted might be a better 
fit for what we're doing.  So I had to have a look once I got home. :)

So far it's looking good; getting Twisted installed and a web instance 
running was a snap on both Windows and Debian.  I had zero knowledge of 
Twisted prior to PyCon, but I was able to start from scratch on Saturday 
and put together a simple web interface to some of our existing Python 
apps by Sunday afternoon.

I did notice something that I'm curious about: I've been running two 
Twisted web instances, one on a Win2k machine (1.4GHz P4, Python 2.2.2) 
and one on a Debian machine (266MHz PII, Python 2.1.3) for a few days 
now, and the Windows instance has accumulated almost an hour of CPU time 
wherease the Debian instance has only used 2 seconds.  What's the Win32 
instance doing while it's idle? (It's not a big deal, I'm just curious)

Thanks!
Alan McIntyre

My first guess would be that the system calls involved (e.g., select)
are more expensive than on linux, but that's just a wild guess. I
doubt profiling would be much help, but maybe you (or someone) could
write a simple test that just recorded the time it takes to run an
immediately-returning select() a few thousand times.

If this doesn't show any useful information, I also realized that
Twisted has some code to handle Windows' wacky select() semantics;
maybe there's something munching a little bit of CPU in those special
cases.

IIRC, the Twisted select reactor has a "background process" that gets 
triggered once a second or so when running on windows just to break the 
select() call (I don't believe it actually does anything).  I believe 
this is because processes in windows don't respond to signals (like 
ctrl-c, for example) during a select() call, so this 
convenience/workaround was put into the codebase.

In any case, an hour of CPU time over a few days is pretty negligible, 
but worthy of note for comparison's sake I suppose.. On a more heavily 
used Twisted daemon, it really wouldn't make any difference, since the 
select() call would spend less time idling.

A simple test shows that select() on 100 sockets, 
1000 times takes 1.313s (Windows XP, P4, 1.5GHz).  
Iterating on just one socket (which I think is 
what happens when idling) takes about 3/100 of a 
second.  To get an hour of CPU time, this would 
take 115 million select()s.  Whether or not that 
many select()s actually happen is up to other 
people. :)

how do you use it with adbapi ?? I mean, how do you use callbacks with your
flow ?

How does it work if a bloc has several inputs ?
I want to do this :

DS1 ---> FS1 ---+
                +--->  FS3
DS2 ---> FS2 ------->  FS3

Two datasources provide some data. Data are used to run Fuzzy Inference 
Systems (FS1, FS2, FS3).

FS3 must wait until all its inputs are ready. Is it possible with flow.py ?
Will it be possible ?

Ah. Judging from your unit tests, It looks you can just import
twisted.trial.unittest as unittest, and existing pyunit tests should just
work.  D'oh!

Thanks!  It was probably a good idea to remove all of the pb baggage from
my test case. ;-)

Yah, I saw a note to that effect in main, but I was following an

Much better.

Ah, I see it now.  The name threw me off, as "crash" doesn't exactly

Just one more thing to say about this:  the installer for Twisted on
Windows provides icons in the start menu for a few things, one of which is
"Twisted Command Prompt".  This prompt runs a very thin batch file which
makes all the commands run on Windows "just like unix"; that is, typing

c:\>mktap

will do what you expect.

This even works sometimes. :-)  

I'd report a bug, but it happened while I was still in the pre-newbie
stage with Twisted, and we have an unusual Python installation (network-
based) so I wasn't ready to blame the Twisted installer.  As I recall,
it was something like win32com.shortcut that was missing, and it was
needed by something that was like "win32_postinstall.py" (I really 
don't remember the name, and can't find the file right now).

The symptom, other than a failure right at the end of the installation
process (after the .pyc files are generated), was the lack of a Windows
start menu entry and any shortcuts...

If there's a concern about this, I can keep my eye out for what it was.

Message-ID: <1049480936.10270.52.camel@troglodyte.funhouse>

Our release schedule, or lack thereof, is getting to me.  I'm reluctant
to deploy new releases of CVSToys because I'd be asking people to depend
on an "alpha" version of Twisted.  At least one person has come in to
#twisted asking if there was going to be a release soon, or if he had to
ask his users to get Twisted from CVS.  

Our last *alpha* release was was five weeks before PyCon started; there
have been over five hundred commits since that time.

I know we've all been busy, I know our release manager has had to devote
his attention to people who will help him pay his bills -- I'm not
concerned with any of that now.  All I want to know is what we have to
do to get another alpha release out.

Tests we're having problems with:

 * testSignal in test_process.PosixProcessTestCase, fails regularly
under buildbot for python2.2, but not 2.1.  I cannot reproduce this
failure.

 * testStor in test_ftp, intermittent failures.

 * ThrottlingTestCase in test_policies has intermittent failures, they
may be spurious timing issues.

 * test_imap is under heavy development, failures changed fresh daily.

 * test_jelly.CircularReferenceTestCase, Jasper's bug.

How many of these do we have to turn green before we can build the next
alpha release?  Is the jelly bug going to wait on newjelly?

Since I'm the one raising a stink, I'll volunteer to manage the next
release should Chris remain unavailable.

(Now why did saying that start the music of foreshadowing doom in my
head?)

Thanks everyone for the quick response.

The command prompt is VERY helpful, given the sorry state of Windows command
line life (and \python22\scripts is not added to PATH by the windows python
installer, so I didn't think to look there).  Sorry I didn't see the
question previously posted.

As for Peter's question about the need for a CGI.FieldStorage type api, it's
really only an issue when you're doing huge multipart mime posts (e.g., file
uploads).  The idea of passing around those results (potentially multi
megabyte) as strings is kind of frightening.  That said, I have no grasp on
what issues are raised when handling these things asynchronously (the cgi
module is all synchronous).

Thanks again.

What is it about passing around multi-megabyte data as strings that scares
you?  The data is only needed temporarily, I would think, until it is written
to a file.  Servers have gobs of memory, and massive file uploads are 
rare... or if they're not, surely the server can have adequate capacity
to handle the load (memory-wise).

Maybe I'm too naive, but unless I was expecting, say, greater than 10MB
or 20MB files on a regular basis, I wouldn't think twice about just using
strings.  Much simpler than trying to juggle temporary files and references
to them and removing them when appropriate etc.

Is your concern a case of premature optimization?

This is indeed an issue and the reason FieldStorage support will return
at some point.

It's not premature optimization, it's proper design for an async 
framework.  If for no other reason, large strings take non-trivial 
amounts of time to process.  For example, on my laptop (which has a gig 
of ram): ('a' * 2**20).replace('a', 'b') takes about 0.35 seconds.. 
Twisted is not threaded, so that's a bad thing to do.  Processing 
chunks with file-like interfaces is scalable, large strings are 
definitely not.

  Thanks for bringing this up.  I've been wondering about it a bit myself as
well.

  I wouldn't be unhappy if imap4 were left out of the next release, if that
release is done before 1) the protocol support is somewhat stable 2) there
is a mailbox implementation in Twisted proper (I currently have one, but not
in Twisted).

  Of course, I also wouldn't be unhappy if it were included, assuming it is
in reasonable condition when someone actually does go ahead with the
release.

  Speaking of newjelly... Is it definite yet whether this will be backwards
compatible with the current jelly yet?  I assumed it would not be, but I've
heard some rumors...

  Since our numbering scheme is currently "* glyph rolls dice.", maybe this
doesn't matter, but I think it *might* be nice if the next release was
1.1.0, if jelly compatibility isn't going to be maintained.

You definitely have a point there.

Zow.  I hadn't counted.  This is pretty bad.

Neither can I.  does anyone have a theory as to what's causing it?

This should be fixed eventually, but it's been having problems forever. 
  We shouldn't hold up the release based on it.

The tests are written incorrectly.  They assert things that should 
usually be true, but aren't necessarily.

JP should get these to pass, but similarly they should not hold up the 
release.

>  * test_jelly.CircularReferenceTestCase, Jasper's bug.

I'll pick this one up, since it's really my fault.  I should be able to 
look at it on Sunday.

The jelly bug shouldn't wait on newjelly because this involves breaking 
compatibility not only with old Twisted, but also with every other 
language implementation of PB that currently exists.  These should 
eventually be fixed, but I think at this point that we just can't 
ignore compatibility in the meanwhile.

Let me give you some advice, from the last time I volunteered to do 
this.  Corner Chris on IRC, get him to explain everything that needs to 
be done, and then take it over.  Don't wait for him to agree that he 
won't be available :-).

It's actually not that much work, now that most of it's automated.  The 
only thing that's really time-consuming is having to re-do it all every 
time somebody checks in a fix, and twice when moving to final-RC to 
final-release.

I think we should stick with 1.0.4, since I think we should do the 
release ASAP, and not wait until we have enough time to test newjelly 
with all the applications that might need it.

And everyone can help by making sure they add changelog entries for any
new features/APIs they added since 1.0.3.

If your queries are returning small results, ie, 
non-incremental, I would just set this up as a 
chain of Deferreds and not bother with flow as
it might be overkill for your needs.

In other words, in the twisted.enterprise.adbapi
when you run a query, it returns a deferred.  So
DS1 and DS2 would be those query results.

Your FS1 and FS2 should be deferred operations
as well, but fired via the 'addCallback' on 
DS1 and DS2 respectively.

Then FS3 is a DeferredList taking FS1 and FS2.

...

If you can use generators, for more complicated flows, 
etrepum's (Bob Ippolito's) approach may be better approach
to this, although I'm not sure how it would handle more
'fluid' flow through the process.  I need to understand
what he's doing better.   At first I thought his approach
is very different than mine, but I think (although I'm
not quite yet able to explain) that they are isomorphic;
only that I'm using a temp stack and he's using the 
event queue via a linked-list. 

...

As for the stuff in flow.py, right now it uses a thread
for each database connection.  Eventually for PostgreSQL,
I'd like to move over to a non-threaded driver.  Gerhard
was working on such a thing as I remember.  Also, it may
be renamed since extrepum was using "flow.py" before me.

Anyway, the database connection is done through a 
QueryIterator which basically sends a set of rows
(via fetchmany) on to the next stage.  So, the connection
from DS1 to FS1 and DS2 to FS2 could be done using 
a simple flow for each.  The problem in the flow module 
has to do with merging the two flows.  This can be done 
by using the 'context'.

In short, it would work, but I'm not sure that it's
your best option; and I'm still not quite happy with
flow.py myself (although it is in production).

Message-ID: <1049574011.1503.45.camel@qutang.gnubian.org>

I'm attempting to implement a simple database application (again) using
twisted.enterprise.row.  Perhaps my failure to do so successfully in the
past should be a hint that I should give up, but the concept seems
really cool, and I keep getting closer.

I'm running into an issue that no doubt has something to do with my lack
of understanding of t.e.row.  I've been wanting to try it for a while,
and decided to design a simple database with the goal of implementing a
simple application using t.e.row.  In any case, it seems I am angering
row.  My first attempt at using it was to try and create/insert a new
row, and i received the following exception:

<- snip ->

the primary key because it is a postgres serial column - that is, it
should automatically increment the pkey each time a new row is
inserted.  If I use setKeyAttr("ZONE_SOAID", 1), the AttributeError
comes up for the next attribute that is not being given a value.

I read the row documentation a little more, and it doesn't appear to
like what I'm trying to do all too much.  I can use python to fill the
object with default values, but the database will do that for me, and
with less work on the part of my application (plus, the KeyFactory class
says it is not thread-safe, I know that my postgres series is).

Is there any way for row to allow me to insert a new row with some empty
values, and simply ignore them (allowing the database to use its'
default)?  If not, any idears on where/how this might need to be done? 
Perhaps this is a good time for me to foray into twisted hacking..

TIA,

Subject: [Twisted-Python] twistctl - start/stop/restart revisited
Message-ID: <20030405231416.GA97462@doublegemini.com>

Toward the end of the discussion this past morning, we seemed
to have come to the agreement that start/stop/restart behavior
does not belong in twistd.  So, I've taken my original submit
and rephrased it as 'twistctl' which is a wrapper on twistd
providing those features.   

To get twistctl to work nicely with twistd, a few refactors
in twistd were needed:

  1.  refactor runApp to factor out the signal code into
      'signalApp' so that killApp in twistctl could use it.
      In general, runApp is quite huge and could use 
      a few breakdowns anyway

  2.  refactor the code to get the passphrase (if the
      application is encrypted) and the code which 
      parses options in run() into a 'parseOptions'
      method so that it can be called from twistctl

  Neither of these changes affect behavior, they only
  expose chunks of reusable code for twistctl

This is a first pass of this, and I'd like to do two
things in the repository: (a) commit the twistd.py.diff
changes, and (b) to put twistctl into the sandbox so
that people can play with it over the next month or
so and after we have a better idea of how it should
behave, we can then add it to the scripts directory.

The twistctl script needs help in many areas: 

  1. Moshez objected to the killApp implementation,
     when I get time I'll look at it.  But right now
     it works on my platform just wonderfully.
     The beauty of open source projects is that people
     can hack at it till it works for everyone...

  2. The restartApp and startApp behavior are not 
     exactly clear as to how they should use -shutdown.tap
     and a bit more research and experimenting is
     needed before this should be formalized.  Really,
     I'm still too new to taps to grok this fully.

In particular, Moshez said that he thinks this script
should *call* the twistd script via OS methods and
thus the refactor above is not needed.  I respectfully
disagree with his assertion.   Calling python from python
via python call mechanism is far superior as it allows
for better error handling, is less platform dependent,
and numerous other factors; such as being able to 
send a passphrase between the two modules easily.

Anyway, please comment.  And Glyph, I'd like permission
to commit the twistd.py.diff as specified below.

No, that's not a beauty.
Let me explain: checking something which "works for me, usually, when
my machine is not heavily loaded" is the worst thing that you can do.
Intermittent failures are *worse* than deterministic failures. Do you
seriously want something that you can't rely on?
It's not that hard to have an algorithm which is correct. Find one,
and code it.

Let me explain: the interface to twistd is well defined. It's documented
in the manpage. We are commited to maintaining backwards compatibility with
it. What you're doing with the refactor is forcing parts of the internal
twistd implementation to stay static. This is insane. We should not add
extra interfaces where existing ones will do. If "twistd" is not on your
path, just fix your Twisted installation. I fail to see how catering
for broken installations is in any way a good idea. Also, if you call
twistd via the OS, then on such places where both twistd2.1 and twistd2.2
scripts exist, *your script* only has to be available once, since it can
receive the name of the binary which has to be run. I'm not going to even
start talking about how most of the twistd flexibility is not needed,
since in real daemons which run from init scripts, the tap cannot be
encrypted anyway, since the key would have to be available to the script.

If you write the twistdctl, and it is actually working on more than one
platform, *and* there is a significant advantage in making it directly
Python->Python, then you can start thinking of adding more places where
we have to promise backwards compatibility in order not to break stuff.
Notice that this is an especially sore point for stuff like twistdctl
which is naturally harder to test in unit tests.

I think your diagnosis is correct. The current t.e code does not handle
default values in the database schema, afaik. Given that, and the fact
that the reflector wants to cache rows by primary keys, it can't support
leaving primary keys unset before you create a new row.

What I have done with postgres is to generate the primay key using
the nextval function on the sequence used for the serial column, setting
the row object's primary key, and then inserting it. This makes the t.e
code happy and you often need to know the new key anyway.

It would be nice to make t.e allow for default values and db-generated
primary keys, but that code would almost certainly need to be 
per-database since different databases handle serial/autoincrement
columns differently.

Yes, you convinced me that the implementation sucks.  This is
why I'm proposing to check it in to the *sandbox* which has 
explicit warnings about broken code.   Once it is there it
can be worked on incrementally... perhaps by people other
than me.  If it stays private then we will have N people
working on the same thing without a chance of collaboration.

I would hardly call it an extra burden, calling it insane is a
bit over-the-top...  in any case, the refactor makes sense even
without users -- runApp is quite large and the code to fetch
the passphrase really belongs more up-stream.

I'm not defending twistd, but it does seem to have a wee
bit more functionality than making twisted applications
into daemons.   Perhaps you should refactor it by moving
what *you* think twistd should be into its own module
and make it callable from twistd.   Something like
twisted.python.daemonize would be clean.  No?

Best,

Clark

Subject: [Twisted-Python] coding standard: plurals for database table names
Message-ID: <20030406175304.GA756@doublegemini.com>

I noticed  in the Twisted Coding Standard that...

   "Database tables shall be named with plural nouns"

I'd like to question this standard for several reasons:

  1. There is not one single rule for forming plurals.
     In particular, some plurals have the same spelling
     as their singluar, 'deer'; furthermore some plurals
     have different forms, 'people' instead of 'persons'.
     Sometimes it is 's' or 'es'.  These differences are
     especially hard for those who have English as a 
     a second language.
     
  2. Tables are to rows as classes are to instances.
     We name Classes singluar, and as such tables should
     also be singluar.  This makes mapping rules easier.

  3. It is helpful to name foreign key columns as the
     same name as the table that they are coming from.
     And it makes little sense to use plurals for 
     column names, for example, when the person table
     may have a 1-M relationship with address, it could
     have a 'address' column name, which is obviously
     a foreign key to the 'address' table.   If you used
     plurals for the table name it brings up the 
     question... do you use plurals for the column name?
     I've seen it done.  *ick*

  4. I often use the double underscore method for link
     tables which represent M-M relationships.  In this
     case good names are hard to find.  For example, a
     link from a person to their address... how do you
     name this?   I use person__address.  If you use
     plurals then this becomes persons__addresses, 
     dooable but ugly.

  5. While there are astechic reasons for this (above)
     the resons become all the more important when 
     you want to build automatic tools for searching 
     over schemata, etc.  In this case, using plurals
     only adds one extra (unnecessary) step in the
     automated translation of plural table names to 
     singluar column and or class names.

In short, I'd recommend singluar nouns, with M-M
link tables as one__two where one and two are 
tables being linked to.

Best,

Clark

What if you have more than one foreign key to the same 
table?  A very simple example (from my app ;^):  the 
attributes "owner", "creator", and "modifier" all point 
to the "persons" table.  As a rule of thumb, it's usually 
best to name the foreign key column after the role that 
the foreign key entity plays in the referring table.

I didn't think it was all that difficult.  I can send you
the O-R mapping I use, if you like.

One could reasonably argue that it is not important to have 
a table-naming rule in the coding standard.  I don't really 
care either way, but I happen to like using plural names for 
tables, and I'll use it regardless of what the Twisted coding std 
says anyhow, because I use my own O-R mapping instead of t.e.row 
(mine is different from t.e.row in many ways, but it does map plural 
table names to singular object names ;^).

Cheers,
- Steve.

A combination of both is best - i.e.

CONT_Contact
  CONT_ContactID FirstName LastName CONT_ContactTypeID

CONT_ContactType
  CONT_ContactTypeID Name

CONT_Organization
  CONT_OrganizationID Name Address

CONT_xref_Contact_Organization
  CONT_ContactID CONT_OrganizationID

CONT_ContactTypeID is a primary key on CONT_ContactType, and a foreign
key on CONT_Contact.  The xref table CONT_xref_Contact_Organization is
obviously a relationship between Contacts and Organizations, and
CONT_ContactID is obviously a foreign key to CONT_Contact.

If you structure tables / references like this, it's very difficult to
miss a bug where the wrong fields are being joined.  This still falls in
line with the recommendation that table names should be singular.

I agree that the Table-Row relationship is similar to the Class-Instance
relationship.  I think that the existence of object relational mappers
like t.e.row support this paradigm.  It is easy to understand the
mapping of programmatical information into the structure of the database
if you can name a class after a table.  Then you have instances of
CONT.Contact and references to a CONT.ContactType instance and one or
more CONT.Organization instances.

You can create higher level objects to further the abstraction, having a
Contact with an organization and type attribute.

I would like to see the O-R mapping that you use, simply to compare
ideas..  I still think singular table names are more logical ;p

well, I beleive it's in the coding standard for the purpose of modules
that rely on a database schema of some sort.  It never hurts to develop
your code in line with the standards of a large framework you're using,
and if it doesn't make sense, you could question it (as we're doing
now).

I'm working on a patch that may allow this for key columns..

This will work but imho is a bit silly and not generally the way that I
expect a database application to work.  If I set the default value on a
column, I shouldn't have to handle that in my code.  Additionally, if
you have a large development team with a DBA who manages the DB schema,
changing the default value for a column shouldn't require a db change
_and_ a code change.. that's inefficient and bug prone..

> It would be nice to make t.e allow for default values and db-generated

I don't really see how allowing key columns to be ignored on an insert
would be database specific..  Ideally, whether or not a default value is
supplied by the database could be kept in rowColumns.  You could then
set a value to allow or disallow setting of key columns with a default
value provided by the database.  This would prevent twisted from
encountering errors, so long as you define your schema correctly. 
Additionally, it would be better for referential integrity's sake..

Anyway, I'd appreciate any comments on my ideas.  I'm evaluating
twisted, including t.e.row, as part of a proposal to migrate our entire
python toolkit to soap or xml-rpc using twisted.  Getting t.e.row to
work in such a way that our large database (515 relations, including
sequences) will not be at risk will be an important part of this task.

Cheers,

-Justin

You don't have to use t.e.row with Twisted. You can use any other
object/relational mapping system, or a custom one. That being said, the
row maintainer is no longer working on it, so if you want to take it up
and work on it that would be nice.

I would very much like to do this.  I've been digging around the code
and I feel pretty comfortable with it.  When you say that row has been
abandoned, does that include the reflectors and such as well?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] epydoc-breaking microdom bug
Message-ID: <20030406224043.GA22604@mumak.net>


I've just attempted to generate API docs for twisted using epyrun, which uses
microdom. 

This fails when run with CVS latest, giving a "TypeError: unhashable instance"
when trying to hash a tuple of microdom.Element and something else.

At Moshe's suggestion, I removed the __eq__ methods from microdom in my local
copy, and generated the docs again. It generates the docs fine, but tests
break. Further, I was told that including the __eq__ methods makes the
behaviour of microdom incompatible with that of minidom, and that this is a
really bad thing.

I'm too zonked to patch things properly atm; could someone please fix microdom
and test_xml to not use / rely on __eq__ methods?

cheers,
jml

How do you fire it exactly ? Moreover, the tutorial about deferred isn't so

3 flows  ? (1 for DS1 to FS1, 1 for DS2 to FS2, and one the merge the 2

I was thinking of using only one flow. It's weird to seperate this process
in several flow, isn't it ?

Hmm, what's the point of this? I thought any files you create get
stored in the _trial_temp directory (because trial os.chdir()s, or
something), which is explicitly left around for post-mortem
debugging. Or were these tests creating files explicitly in other
locations?

I think all that needs to be done is to add a __hash__ method. Just
make it return id(self) (which is how all instances are hashed by
default -- unless they have an __eq__, for some reason).

I don't know what's up with the microdom/minidom compatibility,
though.

The one in CVS is a bit better, bu t it still isn't by

Yes.  In my original version, when you see 'flow' think of
a pipeline.  It was the first approximation.  I'm not totally
happy with it...

Well, your diagram sort of implies a parallel nature, which 
wasn't part of my original requirements.  I have that need
now, so flow needs to be updated to respect this.

If you want to go over this via phone, and you are in the US
or Canada I'd be happy to drop you a line... just send me
your phone number and a good time.

Both test_journal and test_logfile use tempfile.mktemp(), which creates new
directories in /tmp. Neither one removed the generated files (test_logfile
had code to do it, but it was commented out). pyramid had nearly a thousand
spurious /tmp/@1234.5 directories, all owned by me because the buildbot was
creating another dozen or so each time the test suite got run.

Those two tests could probably be modified to create temp file in the current
directory, but that change seemed like it had a higher probability of
failing.

cheers,
 -Brian

PS: folks who have run tests on pyramid, please check /tmp/ (and /tmp in the
sid-chroot) for leftover @1234.5 directories and delete them. You'll have to
do a 'chmod a+rwx' on them first because of a bug in the old cleanup code
(chmod(777) instead of chmod(0777)).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] [PATCH] row / reflector / sqlreflector - case insensitive
 tables/columns
Message-ID: <1049689666.6953.355.camel@qutang.gnubian.org>

Attached is a patch (cvs diff -u) to twisted.enterprise.row (and related
code).  Specifically, it affects the following files:

twisted/enterprise/row.py
twisted/enterprise/reflector.py
twisted/enterprise/sqlreflector.py
twisted/enterprise/util.py

The purpose is to allow for case-sensitive table/column names.  For me,
there are two parts to this:

(1) lots of comparisons in twisted use string.lower
(RowObject.__getattr__(), etc..).  There, theoretically, shouldn't be
any column names that are the same except for their case, but it still
seems logical to allow for case-sensitivity.  This change depends on the
RowObject's case_sensitive_relations attribute (which must be set by
child classes).

(2) I use postgres, and postgres requires you to enclose mixed-case
relation names in double quotes.  Thus, twisted needs to quote table
names, column names, etc..  This change depends on the sqlreflector's
quote_relations attribute, which can be passed as a keyword paramater to
sqlreflector.__init__().

I have given this some basic testing, but am mostly posting it for
scrutiny whilst I continue to work on it.  I think there are some areas
that can be improved, but it works and is pretty clean.

I think that this would be an appropriate time to state my intent to
become the maintainer of the row code, since it has apparently become
abandoned.  I have several other changes in mind, including the ability
to insert new rows without setting their primary keys and such, but I
thought that I should start submitting patches for little stuff to make
sure that the code I'm writing is sane for twisted.

TIA,

-Justin

I don't think I fully articulated my thoughts. Currently the 'reflector'
code caches the rows you create. So, ideally, if the database is going
to set default values on a new row, you'd like the reflector to update
the row object with whatever values the database chose to maintain
consistency between the row object and the database. I haven't
thought about it too closely, but it seems to me that there's no
way to implement that in a database-independent way, but maybe I'm
just missing something.

What do you think?

One strategy I used was to subclass SQLReflector for postgres
databases like so:

class PGSQLReflector(SQLReflector):

    def newRow(self, row_class, template=None):
        return self.runInteraction(self._newRow, row_class, template)

    def _newRow(self, transaction, row_class, template=None):
        row = row_class()

        if template is not None:
            for column, _ in row_class.rowColumns:
                if (hasattr(template, column) and
                    not getKeyColumn(row_class, column)):
                    setattr(row, column, getattr(template, column))

        for key, _ in row_class.rowKeyColumns:
            sql = "SELECT NEXTVAL('%s');" % row_class.keyGenerators[key]
            transaction.execute(sql)
            val = transaction.fetchone()[0]
            row.assignKeyAttr(key, long(val))

        return row

This requires that you specify the names of the sequences used
to generate the keys in the row class. Obviously this code isn't
very general, since it assumes keys will always be generated by 
sequences.

For your extensions which allow defaults, it might be better
to insert the row and then use the 'lastval' function to find
out what key was assigned to the row.

2) I made a pure python (2.2.x+) implementation of itertools, but I 
stole 99% of the code from the "Equivalent to:" text in the

Welll...

I think that if you insert a row and allow the database to assign the
pkey, you can select out the pkey.  I'm not sure this is more efficient
than selecting nextval() before insert, but it would be more
database-independent..

Can you subclass KeyFactory to do something like this I wonder?

Not a bad idear - I missed this before sending my last post.  I beleive
that what I may do is allow for this in an abstract, db-independent way,
and then provide an example PSQLReflector that is db-dependent.  We
shall see ;p

Thanks again!

Some databases have an efficient way to get the key for the last row that
was inserted.  MySQL, for example, has mysql_insert_id() and
LAST_INSERT_ID():

Yes. Looks like we could use this as a basis for a cReactor, and
automatically get platform specific high-performance I/O. There might be
some benefit in a python reactor using a C extension, but that is less
certain.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted systems talking to one another
Message-ID: <200304071500.09093.mclay@python.net>

Are there any examples of having two twisted servers exchanging information. 
The scenario I need to automate is one in which an Original Equipment 
Manufacturer (OEM) negotiating a contract with an Electronic Manufacturer 
Systems (EMS) company. The EMS would procure parts and build a product, such 
as a generic personal computer, a router, or some other type of electronics 
that are mass produced, but with very short product lifecycles.

In this scenario the OEM would use PerspectiveBroker to publish the content of 
a Request for Quote. The contents of the product data package would not be 
entirely revealed to potential bidders. The data would be gradually made 
available based on the state of negotiation in the contracting process. This 
pattern parallels the gradual disclouse of information about the virtual 
world in a MUDD game. 

The trading partners who may wish to bid on the RFQ would copy the initial RFQ 
announcement to the local server where they could run an analysis program 
over the basic contract requirements. If the initial requirements look 
promising they would submit a request for additional information, passing in 
their qualifications in exchange for the added information. A non-disclosure 
agreement would be part of this exchange. Then eventually goal would be to 
respond to the RFQ with a quote and receive a contract to build the OEMs 
product. Between the initial receipt of the RFQ and the sending of the quote 
the two servers would engage in a series of moderated transactions for 
negotiating the terms and conditions for the contract, as well as negotiating 
the schedule for delivery and the potential to substitute parts in the 
assembly process. Some of the transactions between the two companies could be 
totally automated, while others may require human intervention in the 
decision making process.

According to the PerspectiveBroker documents I think this process could be 
made to work. One problem will be in setting up a universal authentication 
mechanism. This may just require using LDAP at all trading partnet sites and 
then federating the LDAP servers into a trading community. I haven't done 
something like that before, so that might be a bit of a challenge.

There are standards for the informationthat need to be used during the 
transactions (RosettaNet and OAG define that XML representations of documents 
such as an RFQ; and IPC defines representations for bills of materials of 
parts to be used and full product data packages), so I won't need to make up 
that part of the system. The rules governing the negotiations are partially 
defined in the workflow definitions of the document standards. I think most 
of the effort will be in building Gtk user interfaces and building the 
business logic to support the interaction between the trading partners. Each 
stage in the negotiation process needs to be scripted and a user interface 
needs to be created. 

So back to my original question. Are their examples that do something similar, 
perhaps in a different context. Do TwistedMatrix MUDD worlds talk to each 
other, do characters and materials shift between worlds, or is each world 
operating in isolation?

I can envision how the operation of the trading partner community could be 
created as a game, or manufacturing simulation environment. Once the bugs 
were worked out the simulator could be used to build and manage a real world 
virtual manufacturing community. Anyone care to estimate how long it might 
take to build the game version of the system using Twisted? I'm too new to 
the software to have a clue on what will be involved.

If there is more than one role, I usually use 'role_table'

only a person table but also an employee table, etc.) in
that case, 'creator' isn't good enough in some cases, you
may mean 'employee_creator' as not all person objects 
may be possible of creating.

I disagree.

While I don't feel particularly strongly about it one way or another, 
pretty much anything that isn't language-mandated ought to be 
standardized so that newcomers to the codebase at least get a common 
feel for certain kinds of naming.

Keep in mind that your personal coding standards need not adhere to the 
Twisted one - that standard is only for code actually checked in to the 
Twisted tree.  It may even be useful for products to diverge, so that 
someone reading code, schemas, or whatever can easily guess which 
components are from which codebase.

That would only work if twisted is the only process adding rows,
I think.

I feel almost embarrassed to bring this item up, as it seems so
trivial... but I think it deserves to be reviewed.

Everything else in the coding standard is very clear and resonably 
justified.  This particular item just stands out from the rest as 
quite arbitrary -- and based on my experience, giving addititional 
complexity without any commensurate advantages, especially for
those who do not have English as their primary language.

The English language can be quite complex, and Plurals and
their rules are a good part of this complexity.  For example,
plural nouns often sound the same as posessive nouns, and this
makes learning them more difficult.  Furthermore, plurals have
irregular forms, or use s or es, sometimes dropping one or more
letters before the modifier.  Even the notion of plurals themselves
is not really a universal construct, as I understand some 
languages use an adjective meaning 'one or more' in conjunction
with singluar nouns to make them plural rather than modifying
the word itself.  Some words are used as both singluar and 
plural.  And lastly, plurals enter into the whole range of 
collective nounds, which differ in their singluar/plural treatment 
depending if you are English or American.  In short, it's just ugly.  
And there isn't any advantage to *requiring* them; especially
when Internationalization is important.

The only somewhat-convincing argument that I've heared for it,
is that "SELECT * FROM people" seems to make more sense than
"SELECT * FROM person".  However, even this advantage falls
apart as soon as you add a where clause...  
   SELECT first_name FROM people 
   WHERE people.last_name = 'Evans'

I like person.last_name myself...

I feel that too much standardization can be a bad thing,

The Twisted implementation lives in 
twisted/protocols/oscar.py.  If you've got any 
questions on how it works, you can get int touch

from a non-native english speaker perspective... i don't understand why.
a WHERE clause can select more than just one persone, i.e., people.
using plurals seems correct and beautifull to me.

i don't seeany complexity in using plurals.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Windows <strike>i hate it</strike> Process API
Message-ID: <20030408024919.GG956@radii>

So, I've discovered[1] something new about Windows. Basically, there's
no such thing as `argv' in win32-land, and each program has to parse
its command-line manually (I had known that they had to do wild-card
expansion manually, but not parse the entire damned string). This
isn't so much the problem as there is no sane Win32 API for starting a
process with a sequence of arguments. The reason this is a problem is
that Twisted's Process API uses sequences of arguments.

In light of this, I have a few somewhat-orthogonal proposals to make,
but I think they should all be done (well, except, perhaps, the last):

 * Add a method to the Win32 Process Interface (IWin32Process?) that
   accepts a string rather than an executable and a list of args. We
   should allow people to use the (unfortunately) sanest method
   available for starting processes on Windows.

 * Add a warning to win32eventreactor.Process.__init__ (in the case
   that the user passed in a sequence of args) that tells people about
   this problem.

 * Add some auto-quoting evilness[2] to
   win32eventreactor.Process.__init__, for when arguments are passed
   as a sequence. What we have there absolutely sucks (" ".join), and we
   should probably at least try to make the existing API as reliable 
   as possible.

 * Perhaps make the string "command-line" API available on
   PosixProcess as well, so people can use either the string or the
   sequence API and expect at least some bit of cross-platformness (but
   I'm fine with telling people to just use the sequence API if others
   don't like this, especially considering this either requires
   calling out to a shell (gah), or doing some unfun argument-splitting.)

*whimper* :-(

It also doesn't use twisted.cred at the moment, so not only are the
resources it serves not pluggable, neither is the authentication.

I'm planning on doing an FTP server rewrite "soon", based on the new
infrastructure that the FTP client now uses (thanks to radix for helping me
with that!).  Given my track record at doing things "soon", I probably
wouldn't hold my breath, though :)

Unless the implementation has changed significantly since I last looked at
it, this is the correct answer.  The select call under win32 times out every
second so that Ctrl-C/Ctrl-Break and other things (like stopping a Twisted
program running as a WinNT service) happen in a timely fashion, rather than
relying on network activity to wake it up.

This is a new test, but an old problem.  The bug here is in the FTP server
(even though we wrote the test to test the new client support for STOR,
which seems to work just fine), and it hasn't changed for months.  On the
other hand, the failures are intermittent, and I suspect it's only a problem
in the test case (it's some sort of timing issue with having the same
process on either end of the socket, I think).

In short: the testStor test failure shouldn't hold up the release :)

Do you have a use-case where the current string-joining breaks?  And if a
Twisted user really cared about passing arguments on Win32, wouldn't it be
easiest to just let them take care of it, e.g.:
    if sys.platform == 'win32':
        args = ["one big string"]
    else:
        args = ["one", "big", string"]
    ...
    
?

I'm not sure that adding lots of platform-dependent infrastructure to
Twisted can offer anything better than that, anyway, so we may as well keep
it simple.

I'm willing to be proved wrong, though -- it's not like I use Win32 anymore
:)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I was talking with Kevin Turner at the pub last night after the "Porpig"
meeting, and he mentioned having the same problem with circular references I
was having, so I offered to post the klu... err, patch I had for the problem.


In short, it checks for _Dereference's (corresponding to dictionaries not yet
available) that are destined to be (erroneously) copied into the __dict__ of
an object that is then returned.  When one is found, it is returned instead
without a containing object, and a method object is scheduled to be run
via postUnjelly.

Later on (in crefutil.py), after the _Derefence has been magically replaced
by it's corresponding dictionary, the dictionary is taken and stored in
the __dict__ of a newly created object.  Even later, the postUnjelly
scheduled earlier is called, which sets the __class__ of the manually
created object.


This is a pretty hideous fix!  But it is minimal, and I think unlikely to
have side effects.  Then again, I do not have a broad understanding of
twisted, and haven't tested it extensively...  Clearly what newjelly.py is
aiming for is superior, and so I haven't been inclined to invest any further
effort.

The cvs -u for the two files affected follows.  Use them as you wish, and
critique is always welcome.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] incredibly minor "fix"
Message-ID: <3E933CCA.3000508@enflyer.com>

	I know, I couldn't have possibly found something smaller. The warning was 
annoying me. This is a patch to FormErrorModel to add the request argument to 
the wmfactory method.

	Also, I was the one in #twisted this weekend asking about woven.guard. I pretty 
much figured it out, it seems so easy now. I have some ideas for making it easy 
(subclassing PerspectiveWrapper) to use any resource to display the login prompt 
(not the auto-generated FormProcessor). Is this something I should submit, or 
does it already work that way and I was too dense to see it?

*Ahem*.

Ok, so it took slightly longer than that...

Thanks to working on this with Chris at PyCon, there is now STOR support for
the FTPClient, currently only in CVS, but it will be in the next release.

Yes. I was passing an arbitrary filename as one of the arguments to a

I didn't think of this. This is a fine alternative to having a
separate API method for it. So, that gets rid of proposal for a new
method. I'm still thinking about implementing that warning, though, as
well as the auto-quoting.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Default reactor without signal handling
Message-ID: <3E9384C4.4D26E913@engcorp.com>

In twisted.internet.reactor, a call to twisted.internet.default.install()
is made automatically.  That call constructs a SelectReactor with
signal handling enabled, without any option for avoiding this behaviour.

What's the recommended approach for installing a reactor without the
signal handling behaviour turned on?

(For the curious, I'm trying to refactor an existing Zope-based 
application which has a "back end" server using a proprietary 
protocol on a non-standard socket.  Currently we just use 
the Zope asyncore and built our stuff on top of that.  We're
trying to move away from Zope, and this looked like the low-hanging
fruit for getting us onto Twisted...   Everything worked fine
when we spiked this, except we had to manually patch the above
call to do "reactor = SelectReactor(0)" instead of what it does
now.

Thanks.

In 1.0.4 and CVS (soon to be released, we hope), you can do:

   reactor.run(installSignalHandlers=0)

Not sure. But I think this should be changed, it is useful for certain
things (e.g. trees of Resources) and we'll need it for WebDAV if we use
Resources for that.

I for one would really like it if this change were made. I have a base 
class that I always subclass instead of resource that does nothing but 
what this patch does.

It seems to be a little bit different from the cvs sandbox version !?
I remember a longer version in cvs. Anyway, I'am going to test it today, and

If you'll re-read what you quoted of me, you'll see that I was
proposing auto-splitting of the arguments, not passing the thing to a
shell. Concatenating is only required in win32; we've already _got_
the arguments in a list (or as my proposal went, in a single string)
from the high-level API.

But you're right about it being a bad idea :) I've decided (in absense
of any others' opinions) to just do auto-quoting-with-a-warning in
win32's case.

Actually, I guess my wording here was a little off. Instead of "gah",
that should be "hello no". >:)

[Recap:  Last night, Bob was complaining that the order that services
were started and stopped was undefined, saying

Bob> well if you have service A dependent on service B
Bob> and you don't want service A to actually start service B
Bob> like let's say you have a database service or something
Bob> and you have another service that wants to persist stuff using the
Bob> database service

so he made the order in which services are started defined as the order
in which they were added to the service collection, and the reverse for
stopping.]

Bob, I fear this solution is too fragile if your services really depend
on one another.  While it will work for now when installing services is
something that happens once in mktap, I fear it'll break down with more
dynamic service management.  Example::

    application.addService("dataStore", StupidStorage())
    application.addService("dataMaker", FooService())

    # ...later, decide we have outgrown StupidStorage:
    application.removeService("dataStore")
    application.addService("dataStore", RealStorage())

With your ordering, the new dataStore will now stop before dataMaker
does.

Instead of introducing ordering dependencies into the flat top-level
service namespace, I think the right answer to your problem is to do as
Chris suggested: Use a hierarchical structure by making dataStore a
MultiService, and adding any dataMaker services at its children.  That
way your dataStore can always make sure its children shut down before it
does.

Does this work for you?  If so, I would like to revert your changes
making Application.services an OrderedDict before the (imminent!)
release, just because anything that requires a change to the
persistnceVersion is a big potential spot for trouble.  We have no
inter-version testing framework at all.

(This whole thing would have passed without comment had I not
encountered an error in upgradeVersion13 in the acceptance tests.  I
*think* I fixed that bug, but I haven't yet found out what triggered it
in the first place (it *should* have been *generated* with version 13,
why was it upgrading?), and who knows what other uglies are hiding in
the dark corners of application persistence.)

Applied, thanks. If anyone else finds any of these in base twisted, 
please let me know.

Well nomatter what, unless it uses 
application.getServiceNamed("dataStore") everywhere, you just broke 
dataMaker.  If you're changing the storage you have bigger things to 
worry about than this little corner case.  You need to pause/stop 
FooService, export all the data from the existing storage, stop the 
existing storage, start the new storage, import all the data into the 
new storage, change FooService's reference to the new storage, 
resume/start FooService, and cross your fingers.

It is a good feature that services get started and stopped in a 
sensible order, there's no reason they shouldn't.  I didn't want to 
change the implementation to a list because that would've required more 
code to change, and had the capability to break existing stuff because 
there is no API iterate an AbstractServiceCollection (or the bastard 
Application class, which should be one but doesn't mixin IIRC).

That's only an issue if you use persisted Application objects, I don't. 
  What if you want to stop the storage without stopping it's children?  
In some cases, my ApplicationServices only depend on the storage for 
initialization anyways, so it wouldn't make sense to force them to shut 
down when the storage does.

You can take out the version upgrade if it doesn't work.  I used an 
OrderedDict for that reason, it has the same interface as a normal 
dict..  so no change to the code (other than stopping in reverse order 
of keys, which will still work on a regular dict, and __init__ of 
course) were made.  The upgrade was purely so new services added to old 
application objects would have their start/stop order preserved.

work in progress on my understanding of extrepum's flow... not
in anyway near perfect

-------------

''' Flow -- async data flows

    This is a flow module which is used for async data flows, 
    in particularly those coming from databases where blocking
    behavior is common.   Implementations will typically use
    generators (or anything implementing the iterator protocol)
    for each stage of the flow.

    Basically, communication within the data flow is carried
    out using the yield statement.  Besides using 'return' 
    or throwing a StopIteration exception, there are several
    items which yield can return:

       flow.Yield      This (singleton) value should be returned when an
                       operation would block, it gives other micro-threads
                       a chance to do their work.

       flow.Callable   A callable object should be returned when a function
                       should be executed.  This adds another stage to the
                       flow. These objects have a 'result' attribute which 
                       is filled in with the output of the function, or a 
                       subclass of failure.Failure for exceptions.

       flow.Iteration  An iterable object, that is, a generator, or array,
                       or class which implements both next() and __iter__.
                       These objects, like Callable, have a 'result' 
                       attribute, but also have a stop attribute which
                       is true when StopIteration has been thrown.

       <anything>      Any other return value

Hello Clarck

Your post is in a wrong thread...

BTW, how do you test this ? It seems to be good (well written), but I'm
not sure to exactly understand what you wanted to do.

If I sum up (from my point of view) :

Callable  : may be a function bloc that run only once
Iteration : may be a function bloc that loop on something (like a
datasource)
and Yield : hum, what's the point of Yield ?


Anyway, this version if different from the one on your website.

The basic pattern, as put forth by extrepum in his post a while back...
http://www.twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2003-February/002808.html
is that you implement your Flow object using a generator...


   def mygenerator():
       print "dosomething"
       d = SubGenerator()
       yield d
       print d.result
       d = AnotherSubGenerator()
       yield d
       print d.result
    
...

 
''' Flow -- async data flow

    This module provides a mechanism for using async data flows through
    the use of generators.  While this module does not use generators in
    its implementation, it isn't very useable without them.

    A data flow starts with a top level generator, which has numerous
    yield statements.   Each yield can return one of several types:

        flow.Cooperate  This (singleton) value should be returned when 
                        the flow would like to give up control of the 
                        call stack to allow other events to be handled.

        flow.Generator  This is a sub-flow (iterator) to be executed.  
                        This object has a 'result' value which can be 
                        checked for each value yielded.   If the last
                        iteration of the sub-flow produced an exception,
                        then a failure.Failure object will be returned.

                        While the sub-flow is generating (it has not
                        returned or raised StopIteration), it will have
                        an 'active' state of true.  Once it is finished,
                        the 'active' state will be false.

       <anything>       Any other return value, which is not a FlowItem

	The path you are passing to mktap web for HTTP request log is somehow

Clark, this is just an alogithme I was thinking of, before I found flow.py

I had to manage different flows in one application.

DS1 ----> BLOC1 ---+
                   |
DS2 ----> BLOC2 ---+---- BLOC3 -----> DS3

is an exemple of what it could be. Every thing is a bloc. DSx are 
datasources (there are also blocs). BLOCx are some treatment bloc that 
operate with their inputs, and provide the result on their outputs.

this is the algorithm comming with :

all bloc are "inactive"
for bloc in blocs:
    if len(bloc.inputs) is 0:
        bloc is "active" # it should be a datasource/producer


gotData(bloc, lines) :
    for line in lines:
        fill in connected blocs's inputs with outputs
        connected blocs are active
        while connected blocs's inputs are set:
            wait # I know, this sucks
    bloc is inactive

while there are still active blocs  
    for bloc in blocs
        if all inputs are available (!= None)
            bloc.proceed().addCallback(gotData)
        

# Fin algo #################################

This doesn't work because we wait for blocs to finish their jobs, and never 
come back to main loop...

This means also that I have to define a mapping between inputs / outputs of 
blocs. I can't see such thing in flow.py, that's maybe why I don't 
understand it well.

I wish I was clear enough :p

Subject: [Twisted-Python] woven guard patch and example
Message-ID: <018e01c2ff72$eb3cf330$6501a8c0@richdesk>

The woven.guard patch attached contains one minor bug fix (changing a
reference in GuardSession.checkExpired from self.site.sessions to
self.guard.sessions). Also, it slightly modifies PerspectiveWrapper to make
using alternate resources for a login page easier.

The example file attached demonstrates using woven.guard with the patch
applied. If anyone wants I can post an example of use without the patch.

Ok.  So, basically, you have an input queue for each
code block, and when a particular condition on the 
queue is triggered, the code block fires.  For BLOC1,
it'd be any input from DS1, for BLOC2, it'd be input
from DS2.  For BLOC3, it'd be both input from BLOC1
and BLOC2.  

This is interesting.  With the new-improved flow 
(aka extrepum's method), this would be listed as
3 generators... plus 2 built-in generators.

DS1 = flow.QueryIterator("some query")
DS2 = flow.QueryIterator("another query")

def BLOC1:
    ds1 = flow.Generator( DS1 )
    yield ds1   # think of as ds1.next()
    while ds1.active:
        result = ds1.result   # value of ds1.next()
        //
        // process ds1.result, possibly
        // sending the result to the next
        // stage using:   yield result
        //
        yield ds1

def BLOC2:
    ds2 = flow.Generator( DS2 )
    yield ds2
    while ds2.active:
        result = ds2.result
        //
        // process ds2, calling yield result
        // to pass on value to next stage
        //
        yield ds2

def BLOC3:
    bl1 = flow.Generator(BLOC1())
    bl2 = flow.Generator(BLOC2())
    yield bl1; yield bl2
    while bl1.active and bl2.active:
        // do somethign with bl1.result and bl2.result
        yield bl1; yield bl2

d = flow.DeferredFlow(BLOC3)
d.addBoth(lambda x: print 'done')
reactor.start()

I'll make a test like this for the flow module so that
it's more clear.   This is such a *HUGE* improvement over
what I was doing... thank you _so_ much extrepum.

Best,

;) Clark

And thank you _so_ much Clark, this starts to make sence to me. When flow
will be finished, it would be a great part of Twisted, and a good
demonstration of generators. I habe great hopes in it :)

Just a question, where the QueryIterator is defined ? I can't find it in
your last post. (Flow just inheritate form object, QueryIterator would be
defined in object ?? hum...)

kind regards,
Philippe

"alpha" rather than "release candidate" is because
accepttests.runMailTest fails.

It is in the CVS version of flow.py... which may not perfectly work
till later this evening.     A copy included below.

''' Flow -- async data flow

    This module provides a mechanism for using async data flows through
    the use of generators.  While this module does not use generators in
    its implementation, it isn't very useable without them.

    A data flow starts with a top level generator, which has numerous
    yield statements.   Each yield can return one of several types:

        flow.Cooperate  This (singleton) value should be returned when 
                        the flow would like to give up control of the 
                        call stack to allow other events to be handled.

        flow.Generator  This is a sub-flow (iterator) to be executed.  
                        This object has a 'result' value which can be 
                        checked for each value yielded.   If the last
                        iteration of the sub-flow produced an exception,
                        then a failure.Failure object will be returned.

                        While the sub-flow is generating (it has not
                        returned or raised StopIteration), it will have
                        an 'active' state of true.  Once it is finished,
                        the 'active' state will be false.

       <anything>       Any other return value, which is not a FlowItem

Subject: [Twisted-Python] twisted.news cleanups and tests
Message-ID: <20030410213554.GA58576@mithrandr.moria.org>

Hi,

I'd like to know what people think about the following patch and tests.

These are my first tests for Twisted, so I'm not sure whether I'm
stepping over any style rules.

The patch fixes the unusability of NewsShelf due to dirdbm wanting to
try use directories as files.  It also stops us from putting '\n\r\n'
into the start of the body, and it puts '\r\n' termination on the last
line of the headers.  It moves placing the extra '\r\n' between the
headers and body in the one place it's necessary - articleRequest.

I haven't tested NewsStorage or NewsStorageAugmentation yet, but these
changes shouldn't be a problem.

The test cases detect the problems listed above, and perform some
general sanity tests.

Thanks,

Neil

Subject: [Twisted-Python] rewrite of flow.py completed
Message-ID: <20030411073834.GB11627@doublegemini.com>

Ok.  The complete re-write of flow.py based on the work of 
extrepum ("Bob Ippolito") is finished, with a test case
checked in.  This differs from extrepum's work [1] in 
some ways, but is almost identical in others.

1.  The implementation and test suite does not use generators,
    thus it is safe for 2.1 usage... although I can't imagine
    anyone using it without generators.   But the advantage 
    is that it could go into the current Twisted code base.
    The test suite uses iterators (with the corresponding
    generator commented out).

2.  This implementation has 4 distinct components:

    a) the core 'Flow' class and its supporting items, could be
       put into something like twisted.python.flow as they only
       depend upon other twisted.python stuff.  

    b) There is a DeferredFlow which uses Flow as a mix-in with
       Deferred, with behavior similar to DeferredList.  This 
       could go into twisted.internet.defer

    c) There is a ThreadedIterator which depends upon DeferredFlow, 
       and can be used to merge blocking behavior into the 
       framework.   This could go into twisted.internet.threads

    d) There is a very small class which builds upon ThreadedIterator
       that uses a pool from twisted.enterprise.adbapi; however, 
       in this context the async features of adbapi more or less
       get in the way.   So, perhaps this is best left as an example.

    In particular, extrepum's work build on top of Deferred, which
    I think is unnecessary; thus quite a bit of simplification 
    occurred when stripping out the Deferred stuff, and instead
    treating DeferredFlow as a cross product or mix-in of 
    Flow and Deferred.

3.  Extrepum's work was more 'flat' and didn't take recursive
    use of the technique into consideration; or perhaps I just 
    didn't understand how it would handle recursive usage.
    In any case, this implementation allows generators to call
    other generators and provides a nice stack unwinding, etc.

4.  I'd like to eventually look more at extrepum's work to 
    see if he had additional aspects that I've missed.  If 
    those aspects are generally useable, then I'll include 
    them.

Anyway, that's about it.  I'm now rebuilding some of my internal
code to use this module and ripping the old flow.py out.  This 
flow overall has been *greatly* simpler usage -- and I can't
thank extrepum enough for pointing me to his usage of generators
to create async flows within Twisted.

I'd also like to thank Itamar, Moshez, Radix, and Exarkun for
helping me along and pointing me in the right directions.

Best,

Clark

""" Flow -- async data flow

    This module provides a mechanism for using async data flows through
    the use of generators.  While this module does not use generators in
    its implementation, it isn't very useable without them.   A data flow
    is constructed with a top level generator, which can have three 
    types of yield statements:  flow.Cooperate, flow.Generator, or
    any other return value with exceptions wrapped using failure.Failure
    An example program...

            if lst.stop or nam.stop: 
                return
            yield (lst.result, nam.result)

    def consumer():
        title = flow.Generator(['Title'])

Jasper: thanks so much for investigating this one!

I think Glyph finally nailed this bug in some code that went into CVS a few
days ago. It should be in the latest release (1.0.4a2). Could you give that a
try and see if it fixes your original bug? The test case that exarkun added
now passes, but I'd like to make sure your code is now working too.

thanks!
 -Brian

I didn't have much choice, as the objects I'm transporting are circular. ;-)

Unfortunately it doesn't work for me. :-(

The simple test case at the end of test_newjelly.py _does_ work, but the
orignal more verbose test I posted (using pb) doesn't work, getting the same
__dict__ error as before.

So I tried replacing jelly.py with newjelly.py, with my fingers crossed.
Both the unit test and my "acceptence" test then work, but my code still
doesn't work...  Arg!

The error is from the assertion on line 40 of crefutil.py:
class NotKnown:                                   |
    ...                                           |

Here're updated versions of the patch and the test case.  We also pass
test_nntp now...

Well nomatter what, unless it uses 
application.getServiceNamed("dataStore") everywhere, you just broke 
dataMaker.  If you're changing the storage you have bigger things to 
worry about than this little corner case.  You need to pause/stop 
FooService, export all the data from the existing storage, stop the 
existing storage, start the new storage, import all the data into the 
new storage, change FooService's reference to the new storage, 
resume/start FooService, and cross your fingers.

It is a good feature that services get started and stopped in a 
sensible order, there's no reason they shouldn't.  I didn't want to 
change the implementation to a list because that would've required more 
code to change, and had the capability to break existing stuff because 
there is no API iterate an AbstractServiceCollection (or the bastard 
Application class, which should be one but doesn't mixin IIRC).

That's only an issue if you use persisted Application objects, I don't. 
  What if you want to stop the storage without stopping it's children?  
In some cases, my ApplicationServices only depend on the storage for 
initialization anyways, so it wouldn't make sense to force them to shut 
down when the storage does.

You can take out the version upgrade if it doesn't work.  I used an 
OrderedDict for that reason, it has the same interface as a normal 
dict..  so no change to the code (other than stopping in reverse order 
of keys, which will still work on a regular dict, and __init__ of 
course) were made.  The upgrade was purely so new services added to old 
application objects would have their start/stop order preserved.

The reason it's marked "alpha" rather than "release candidate" is
because accepttests.runMailTest fails.

Dear Twisted Users,

In the last few months, Twisted seems to have become exponentially more 
popular.  I need to create more graphs and charts that show this in a 
systematic way, but I can certainly tell you that my bandwidth has been 
utilized more than it was in the past.

As many of you know, I host twistedmatrix.com in my home, on a 
"business DSL" line.  All of the Twisted developers use this machine, 
for running tests, running their own development servers, and checking 
their email.  It also runs the twistedmatrix.com web site and CVS 
server.  I like this set-up since it makes it relatively easy to make 
backups quickly, upgrade the hardware on this machine to meet demand, 
and "eat our own dog food": use various Twisted services in production.

With increased popularity comes increased traffic.  While the CPU of 
our development system remains at near-idle load, the bandwidth here is 
clearly inadequate.  Also, although I do nominally run a business here 
(a few *very* small odd hosting jobs) that's certainly not paying the 
full cost of keeping business DSL running.  I also don't really have a 
good enough set-up to set up a sensible contribution plan like the 
http://www.gnu-darwin.org/ site.

So, if you would like to see better performance out of the 
twistedmatrix.com site, I've finally gotten a personal PayPal "donate" 
button working that you can send contributions to.  You can find it on 
my personal website:

	http://www.twistedmatrix.com/users/glyph/scribbles/

Please include "bandwidth" in the "special instructions" field that you 
see when you send a contribution.  Also, please don't contribute 
anything if you're struggling yourself.  The developers should be 
beneficiaries of such contributions, not the donors.

Be advised that if I were to somehow become fabulously wealthy from 
these contributions, it would definitely be a good thing for the 
project as a whole ;-).

In related news, we are working on a plan to recognize folks and 
companies who have contributed to development of particular areas of 
Twisted.  As-yet-unacknowledged sponsors include Zoteca, Divmod, and 
Ninjaneering.  If you'd like to be a sponsor of a particular area of 
Twisted development, I'd like to hear from you.

Sometime soon there will definitely be a more structured way to 
organize such efforts, but until then, every little bit helps.  I 
encourage other Twisted developers to get other similar "donate" 
buttons - I would like to put up a "tip jar" page at some point where 
users can select a developer and contribute something.

Thank you so much Clark ! 
BTW, I'd like to test flow.py for my own student projects, but documentation
is in several threads on the newsgroup. Moreover, they are sometimes for
deprecated versions of flow.py. The best would be to write a little
tutorial, and include it in the HOWTO documentation. flow.py would be so
clear for most people.

I'd like to sea some real exemples with QueryIterator and the way to manage
several flow in an application.

If you need some help to write it, maybe I can write some specific parts.
But due to my poor english, this will be painful for me :-p

Just some questions : 

- will flow.py be included in Twisted 1.0.4 (rc) ? 
- Did you write some unit tests ?
- could you add the outpout of your exemple (at the beginning of flow.py) ?


- In QueryIterator :

"
            self.curs = conn.cursor()
            if self.data: self.curs.execute(self.sql % self.data) 
"
but :

>>> 'cursor' in dir (adbapi.ConnectionPool)
0

I think you want to use a 'standard' pool corresponding to API DB 2.0
twisted.entreprise.adbapi.ConnectionPool doesn't have a cursor method.
NTL, it's just the right use of flow, because we don't want a deffered here
(because of thread use).



kind regards
Philippe

  Niel,

   Thanks!  I've neglected t.news for too long.  It looks like there are
some good fixes in here.

    I notice there's a fix for parsing headers with continuations included
here too, which is cool.  I don't think I was even aware of such things when
I wrote the code originally - what seems apparent to me now, though, is that
Article either shouldn't exist at all, or that it should grow into (and move
somewhere appropriate for) a fully-fledged, asynchronous message parser that
can be used throughout Twisted wherever email-like messages need to be dealt
with.

    In the test cases, you also used assert_() (but just once, I assume it
was an oversight), which shouldn't be access directly by tests cases, so I
changed this to a failUnless().  Also, I personally make it a point to turn
string module calls into string method calls when cleaning up code, and so
have done this as well.

    All in all, nice work.

  Jp

says who?  why not?  I've always thought it was just an alternative
spelling of failUnless, and that it has the dangling underscore simply
because 'assert' is a keyword in Python.

  Says me!  Rar!  I thought we only still supported it because PyUnit had
it.  In any case, it *is* bound to the same function as failUnless, so it
makes no practical difference, and I'm certainly not the authority for
Trial.  Multiple spellings for the same thing sucks, though, and given a
choice between the two, I'd pick failUnless() any day.

IIRC, Trial's unittest module has multiple spellings for a lot of 
things.  What we should probably do is make a decision on one set of 
spellings and issue DeprecationWarnings for the rest.

If you look, the conn is created from self.pool.connect() which
returns a standard API DB 2.0 connection.  I would have rather had
the constructor take a connection, but this won't work as the
Twisted ADBAPI uses the current thread to find the connection, thus
pool.connect() must be run in the appropriate thread, which is
not the thread where the constructor for this class would be executed.

QueryIterator uses the ThreadedIterator.  ThreadedIterator basically
is two iterators that are 'linked' together, one in the main thread
and one in the thread which is allowed to block.  The two iterators
communicate with a shared list which holds intermediate output, ie,
it is the message queue from the iterator in the secondary thread 
to the primary thread.   Anyway, the iterator in the primary thread
is a simple 'proxy' like iterator, which raises Cooperate if there
isn't any data available from the secondary iterator.

Here is a simple example of how to make a ThreadedIterator...
note that the sleep(.1) call is not executed in the main 
thread -- that's the whole point of the ThreadedIterator.

        class CountIterator(flow.ThreadedIterator):
            def __init__(self, count):
                flow.ThreadedIterator.__init__(self)
                self.count = count
            def next(self): # this is run in a separate thread
                from time import sleep
                sleep(.1)
                val = self.count
                if not(val):
                    raise flow.StopIteration
                self.count -= 1
                return [val]
        def res(x): assert([5,4,3,2,1] == x)
        from twisted.internet import reactor
        f = flow.DeferredFlow(CountIterator(5))
        f.addCallback(res)
        reactor.callLater(2,reactor.stop)
        reactor.run()

Anyway, I made a bunch of checkins about a day ago to clean
up some of the documentation and to add the test_flow.py

""" Flow ... async data flow

    This module provides a mechanism for using async data flows through
    the use of generators.  While this module does not use generators in
    its implementation, it isn't very useable without them.   A data flow
    is constructed with a top level generator, which can have three 
    types of yield statements:  flow.Cooperate, flow.Generator, or
    any other return value with exceptions wrapped using failure.Failure
    An example program...

            while 1:
                yield lst; yield nam
                if lst.stop or nam.stop: 
                    return
                yield (lst.result, nam.result)

Speaking of such message-unifying work:

Moshe and I were recently on IRC, discussing a unification of several 
disparate message representations within Twisted.  We're not exactly 
sure where this is going, but in a future release, the .mail, .words, 
and .news packages should all be unified, probably under the heading of 
"words", in order to present a coherent messaging API for things like 
bots which don't care whether you're talking to them through email, 
netnews, IRC, AOL IM, or whatever.

What this really means is that words is going to grow a 
"store-and-forward" mechanism as well as a "store-and-check" mechanism. 
  Also, a higher-level POP3 and IMAP client will be integrated for 
retrieval of messages.

twisted.im also needs to be refactored, in order to make its API more 
coherent and easier to register observers of.  However, it remains 
unclear whether this kind of functionality actually deserves a separate 
package (that .words will use) or whether it will go into .words 
directly.  Moshe has me mostly convinced that it should remain an 
independant package, since real-time-client code is going to look 
significantly different to abstract-message-processing-and-forwarding 
code.

Thoughts?

I'll be watching this with interest. I'm not going to say it's 
impossible or crazy, but I'd like to see how all the inherent 
difficulties in making a "generic messagey thing" are overcome.

 From the top of my head:
  - IMAP and NNTP have a bunch of folders, POP3 has just one.
  - IMAP lets you create folders and move messages about, NNTP doesn't.
  - Instant messaging apps have no folders, but you could no doubt 
synthesise an 'inbox'. Some IM systems let you have 'categories' of 
buddies, which you might present as message folders. However, then IM 
has the restriction that a given folder can only contain messages from 
one recipient, which is not the case with IMAP or NNTP.
  - POP3 and NNTP need to be polled for new messages, IM protocols alert 
you when a new message comes in. I'm not sure which way IMAP goes.
  - Email and usenet messages generally have a variety of interesting 
and useful headers that end-user applications are going to want to look 
at, IM messages do not.
  - IMAP and IM are stateful protocols, POP3 is not. I'm not sure about 
NNTP.
  - Email and usenet messages have message-threading, IM does not.

I can't see any sort of 'core feature set' and 'extension feature set' 
in the above list, more like every protocol and format cherry-picks the 
features it wants from a central store.

Another idea - of the various communication sources I personally use, 
they generally fall into 'IM-style (ICQ, IRC)' and 'email-style (email, 
usenet)' interfaces. One message source that I read in email-style that 
I have not yet seen mentioned is RSS. That would be an interesting 
thing to add to  a Universal Messaging client, wouldn't it? :)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Would this do it?
Message-ID: <20030413160743.GA8677@matilda.southern.edu>

Enlightened ones,

I'm trying to develop a small server for a checkers tournament that we
are trying to host in our school.  Students will submit their entries
that talk on stdin-stdout.  Our idea was to make a socket server that
receives all the connections and then makes them all play a tournament.
I've been thinking about doing it from scratch, just using an array of
connections somehow, but this has proven to be way more difficult than I
anticipated.  For one, I've had a difficult time trying to figure out a
way of 'managing' the server real-time.  I've come across twisted just a
day ago, and I'm wondering if I could make it work for me.  Is twisted
applicable to my problem?

I'd appreciate any an all input anyone can give me.  I am quite the
beginner in python, but I'm willing to read up anything that needs to be
read :)

Thanks a ton.

dansan.

But from a client perspective, everything but the inbox ends up 
locally.. so you could have the UI be just like IMAP or NNTP, you would 
just augment the POP3 account(s) with a local datastore.

So perhaps you just raise exceptions if you try and move messages on a 
NNTP server?

AIM has a "chat room" feature which would allow multiple participant 
'folders'

So you have a unified "notification center" type API.  Whether it gets 
notified async or needs to poll to generate notifications is just an 
implementation detail for each protocol.

IM messages have sender/recipient addresses and timestamps.. A chat 
room could have a bunch of "CC's".  What headers other than 
from/date/to/subject/etc are ever really that useful?

That's a protocol implementation detail.  Twisted is very good at 
stateful protocols.. just because POP3 isn't completely stateful 
(although it does keep state as to whether or not you're authenticated) 
doesn't really change anything.

>  - Email and usenet messages have message-threading, IM does not.

IM is sort of threaded.. each conversation with each person could be 
considered a thread.. It's certainly not like a conversation with a 
particular person is a set of completely unrelated messages (although 
it can be :).

  This is easy, POP3's single folder is IMAP4's "INBOX", and NNTP lives in
an entirely different namespace from regular IMAP4 folders.

  A related point: what isn't clear to me is how to handle the difference
between the practically required download-all-messages behavior of POP3, and
the complete opposite of IMAP4 and NNTP.

>  - IMAP lets you create folders and move messages about, NNTP doesn't.

  IMAP is allowed to reject these operations, so NNTP and POP3 could
just have this error behavior in all cases.

  Hmm.  No ideas from me here, yet.

  This is a kinda neat coincidence.  IMAP4 does both.  So we need both
behaviors, but POP3/NNTP will only use polling and IM will only use
notification.

  I'm not sure what the right answer is here.  One solution might be to add
headers to IM messages when exposing them through this API.  The information
for most of the common ones is available: From, Sender, Reply-To, To, Date
are obvious, CC and BCC are probably mostly empty (but ICQ used to support
multi-person chat, I don't know of any other protocols do, or if ICQ still
does); Subject is tough, and Message-ID I guess we'd generate ourself. 
Those are all the official "envelope" headers that are required to exist,
Subject being the only one that we really don't have information about -
perhaps giving users a way to tag exchanges with some value, or just leaving
it empty?

  OTOH, it makes sense to view IM messages in groups, not one at a time.  I
don't see how you could coherently add headers to more than one IM message.

>  - IMAP and IM are stateful protocols, POP3 is not. I'm not sure about 
> NNTP.

  NNTP isn't, unless you go into pipeline mode (which Twisted doesn't
support [well?]).  Can you go more into why this might be a problem?  I
think the protocol code should handle any issues raised by this, and present
a unified front to the messaging API.

>  - Email and usenet messages have message-threading, IM does not.

  I think you could do some neat stuff with temporal analysis and trainable
neural networks, but I've got exactly zero practical experience with either
of these techniques, so I won't say this isn't a potential problem :)

  Some problems I foresee:

  - With email, you should always [according to standards documents, anyway]
    have a pretty good idea of what kind of data you're being handed. 
    Content-Type and other MIME headers make it easy enough to decypher what
    someone just sent you, but afaik, no IM protocols that support file
    transfer deal with this.  What's the correct way to handle a file with
    no meta data?

  - PGP; we can verify signatures, but security conscious users will want
    this done client-side - that means preserving the exact structure of the
    message somehow and then sending it on to them.  This doesn't play
    nicely with the idea of being able to receive one kind of message and
    send it off as another kind.

but I would like to discuss it and other patches like it.  Not to pick 
on bob here; there isn't really a policy on avoiding bloat in Twisted, 
so it can't be said that this is a violation of anything in particular. 
  I just think we need one.

First, my question is: do we have more than one or two users who 
actually need this functionality?  If it's a real, present need for a 
wide variety of applications, then much of this criticism does not 
apply.

Addition of stuff like this strikes me as similar to the addition of 
complicated preference panels to GNOME to work around core usability 
problems, which only created a new usability problems.

This patch is a band-aid on an already crummy and huge interface 
(twisted.internet.app is nasty; ask anyone who has had to work on its 
internals) which makes it even crummier and huger.

Huger: it inflates the interface by one more potentially redundant 
class, so that we have that many more places to insert deprecation 
warnings when we refactor the whole mess into something usable.

Crummier:

"utility" patches like this will invariably fail to take edge cases 
into account well.  I wouldn't say it's immediately obvious how 
edge-cases *should* be taken into account, personally, but I would 
guess that half-changing the semantics of the ordering in case of 
failure is not the correct thing to do.

My concern is that some ill-thought-out parts of Twisted (twisted.cred, 
twisted.internet.app) will become calcified behind a wide and fragile 
interface that prevents any hope for refactoring.  So far, development 
on these kinds of problem areas has been fairly dynamic, because they 
have been kept small and simple.  However, the inevitable weight of 
history is already slowing down more improvement.  I would like to not 
increase that weight any more than necessary.

I'm using twisted's Perspective Broker for a generic turn based game engine,
and it works smoothly.  Using PB allows you to write your api almmost as if
networking wasn't involved, excepting only that you'll need to use "callRemote"
for client/server calls instead of normal method calling (and connect your
client/server of course).

The Perspective Broker section on this page was usefull to me:

I may be missing something, but this seems like a non-sequitur ...
isn't the putative crumminess and/or hugeness of its interface 
independent of the nastiness of its internals?  (Or at least, 
shouldn't it be ...?  But maybe that's part of what you're

This does not make me feel warm and fuzzy.  ;^)  Okay, 
I admit to having had bad thoughts about cred ... how much 
work do you see it needing?  (Because I'm fixin' to use it 
in the near future ... :^)

Jp, I realize Twisted unittest is either slightly older than the standard,
or perhaps slightly evolved from it, but I'm not sure why you think 
assert_() shouldn't be used directly by TestCases.  According at least to 
http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/testcase-objects.html it's merely
a synonym for failUnless(), as all the other assertXxxx() variants are 
synonyms of their respective failXxxxx() methods.  I think it is intended
to be a perfectly valid exposed method.

Yes, sorry... my response was already obsolete before I posted it.
Shouldn't count so much on my (also obsolete) mail reader's threading
capabilities to tell me when I'd read all messages on this topic.

(By the way, I think there's actually a place for both forms of the
assertXxxx() and failUnlessXxxxx() methods.  Sometimes the logic
just seems clearer to write it (and read it) one way, or the other.  
Perhaps that's a sign of smelly programmer thinking, but all I can do 
is report on what I've experienced personally...)

Yeah, the problem is that the interface is sufficiently ill-specified 
and lacking in features that folks will depend upon the internals for 
complete semantics.  The goal is to have as few intermediary versions 
of the internal semantics before we arrive at something well-specified 
and good :).

If I knew exactly how much work it needed, then the work would probably 
have begun :).

However, cred is in an acceptable state at the moment.  Most of the 
cruddiness has to do with backwards-compatibility hacks to a 
significantly worse version of itself.  When these get removed (circa 
Twisted 1.1), there are still a few semantic holes that need to be 
filled, such as the real utility of MultiService, but all in all it 
works as-is.

It's in a much less bad state than twisted.internet.app, at least in my 
opinion ;)

Do we have more than two users that _know_ they need/want this 
functionality?  Probably not, yet.

Here's a use case.  Let's say you have some sort of service hierarchy 
that resembles a system startup.  The way Darwin does this is that it 
has plist files bundled with the actual "rc" scripts that determine 
which services get started and in what order by SystemStarter.  Here's 
an example plist file (in NeXT format, because XML is retarded) for the 
LDAP service:
{
   Description     = "LDAP";
   Provides        = ("LDAP");
   Requires        = ("Network Configuration", "DirectoryServices");
   OrderPreference = "None";
}

In this case, in order for LDAP to start, the services that provide 
Network Configuration and DirectoryServices must already be running.  
It doesn't care which ordering bucket it sits in (OrderPreference can 
be Last, First, etc.), and it provides LDAP functionality to other 
services that want it.

DependentMultiService is a very crude basis for such a mechanism, 
because I don't need that kind of functionality yet.  However, it does 
provide a pretty decent base class for a future Twisted "SystemStarter" 
equivalent... which we *should* want to have someday.

Thinking like this could potentially make things such as tying 
authorizers to pb services and whatnot easier, if they're done in a 
service collection manner rather than just tied to the same parent.  
However, as you said, app and cred are already nasty and need a major

Basically, it's not at all obvious what you do if you have a failure in 
a collection of interdependent services.  On startup or shutdown, if 
one fails, you obviously aren't going to be able to say that whole 
collection is started or stopped properly, so I make the remainder of 
the running services shut down immediately.  The only difference in 
semantics is that once a failure happens, the service stopping is no 
longer chained (the rest of the running services get stopService called 
immediately).  It really depends on what kind of services you have to 
determine whether you want to try and chain this or not.. but in most 
cases, startService and stopService don't return deferreds anyways, and 
in even more cases, you don't expect them to fail.  I'll go ahead and 
add an __init__ option that lets you decide which behavior gets chosen 
in the case of a failure.

Also, the fact that I'm returning a deferred here either way means that 
it's probably possible that you could even set a timeout.. which is 
kind of cool, but I've said before that the Deferred timeout API can 
cause some issues (it can't actually make something NOT happen.. which 
is really unfortunate).  I really think there should be an API to 
cancel Deferreds, and the methods that return them should be refactored 
to respect a cancel whenever possible.

  I think I need this, but order is such a hard topic, I've mostly ignored
it and relied on luck to keep my app working instead of coming up with a
good solution.  I'm not entirely sure (and I won't be devoting time to the
project where it's needed in the near future) DependentMultiService solves
my use-case, but if not, something like it probably would.

As some of you know, I'm developing a Twisted application called Hep. 
Hep is a multiprotocol message server that lets users set up connections
to various messaging systems (currently: RSS, POP3, SMTP, Blogger API,
and local maildir storage) and then read/write to those connections
through various protocols (currently: POP3, SMTP, NNTP).  Hep also has a
web server with a basic web interface for managing things.

Anyhow, since I've been working on this project I've been thinking a lot
about abstraction layers for messages.  So here are some incomplete
late-night thoughts:

* First, I define 'message' very loosely: a short text communication
written by one person for one or more other persons to read.

* Formats, protocols, and storage are loosely coupled.  rfc822 is a
format for messages.  So is RSS.  So is HTML (if you want to look at it
that way), or plain .txt. SMTP, NNTP, IMAP, or POP3 can all be used to
transfer rfc822 messages.  HTTP is typically the protocol used to
transfer RSS and HTML.  You can store messages in plain directories,
specialized directory layouts like maildir, file formats like RSS and
mbox that support multiple messages, databases, etc.

* All types of messages, by definition, have a body (although it may be
left blank).

* Almost all messages can be looked at in terms of "from" and "to". 
Even personal-use text files on the local system.  Even web pages,
although the "from" might be unkown, and the "to" might be "anyone in
the world who happens to be interested in this"

* Most, but not all, message formats support the idea of a
title/subject.

* Messages can contain other messages.

* You can't rely on getting a (correct) mime-type along with the message
- I've had to resort to letting my format handlers try to figure out for
themselves whether they can handle a given file if the mime-type is
unknown.

* For messaging protocols, the basic operations are "scan" (and/or
"fetch"), "post", "edit", and "delete".  Fetch is almost universal,
although the way this works varies a lot from system to system.  My
messaging library currently has a single function that every protocol
supports, scan().  You run connection.scan(messageHandlerFunction), and
the connection will try to get whatever messages might be available
there, and run messageHandlerFunction on each message.  scan() returns a
deferred, which will be called back if the scan has completed, and there
won't be any more messages found unless scan() is called again. 
Although I haven't implemented it my idea has been that for
always-connected systems like IMAP and instant messaging, scan() would
continue to run until the connection was terminated.

* post() is pretty easy to abstract across various systems, and works
well for SMTP, IMAP, NNTP, various blog APIs, instant messaging, and
local message stores.  It even works with vanilla HTTP, sort of.

* So far I haven't put implemented edit() or delete() on anything except
local message stores, so no comments there.

* Folders and chat rooms are basically the same thing - a place where
messages are posted to and read from.

* I'm using URLs to describe places you can access messages.

Anyhow, I'm not sure what level of support for all this you want to have
in Twisted.  If you really wanted to go all out it's possible to create
a layer of abstraction that would let you read/write to a local mbox
file, a NNTP newsgroup, an RSS file accessed through HTTP, and a folder
full of text files, all using the same API.  That's the direction I'm
going in at the moment, but it's probably too wide a scope for the core
Twisted APIs.


If anybody here is interested in seeing my attempts at creating a system
that implements these kinds of ideas, you can check out the code from
CVS:

:pserver:anonymous at cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/hepserver

The two modules are "messaging" (the messaging abstraction layer, which
is usable on it's own - see examples/copymessages.py) and "hep".  If you
want to run Hep you'll also need the Lupy text indexer from divmod.org. 
You might also to read my weblog entries from last week at
http://www.fettig.net/.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] The Woven Way?
Message-ID: <uwuhx4wa9.fsf@yahoo.com>

First off, the cliche (but nonetheless genuine) thanks for the awesome set of tools!

Is there any way for a Woven resource script to retrieve the uri with which it was called, similar to passing arguments to a CGI script via the url?

Say I have a twisted server that I'd like to monitor via Woven pages.  One of the pages looks something like:

Port1  Up    Details...
Port2  Down  Details...
Port3  Up    Details...

where the "Details..." items are links to another Woven page.  If I were doing this with a CGI script, the links would contain something like href="details.rpy?port=1", or href="details.rpy?port=37", and details.rpy would grab the uri and generate the desired page.  I suspect I'm looking at this all wrong by thinking in terms of passing arguments via the url, but don't know what would be a more naturally Woven way to do this. Any guidance would be most appreciated.

Thanks,


Eric.

Ok, after more careful searching and discussion with Glyph I think we nailed
it. The fix we put in earlier wasn't being used when PB calls jelly, but only
when jelly was run by itself. I've added the necessary code (and a new unit
test). It should be fixed now. The clientBug/serverBug scripts you attached
to your earlier message now run without error for me.

Thanks for your patience, and for the great bug report. That test script was
exactly what we needed.

Note to other bug submitters: following Jasper's excellent example will
greatly improve the chances of getting your bug fixed quickly :).

The one I've recently decided was good is "If there's no other code in

YAGNI.

More specifically - maybe we will eventually need such a thing.  In the 
process of building a real "SystemStarter" equivalent, however, we may 
find that DependentMultiService actually isn't that useful, and we 
instead want to use some other intermediary dependency management 
strategy.

In a more optimistic case, we're merely maintaining an interface to an 
implementation detail that people shouldn't be using.  In a worse case, 
we have another twisted.python.observable on our hands - dead code that 
one or two things are using because we haven't had time to update them 
to use TwistedStarter instead.

In fact, I think that TwistedStarter sounds like a good idea - it 
provides a high-level interface to some functionality that may be 
tricky to implement correctly.  If you would go all the way and 
implement that I would probably be less unhappy than if this stayed in 
:-).

However, this is just an advice, not an "MDFL pronouncement" - the 
final call on that module is Itamar's, and if he's not going to stop 
you checking it in, then I'll concede.  I was mainly using this as an 
example, not as a particularly egregious thing that really needs to go. 
  I want Twisted developers to consider things like continuing 
maintenance before checking things in.

Your analogy is broken. If you have some code that needs
DependantMultiService, then you can check in DependantMultiService at
the same time as your code. If it's only application-code (i.e., an
application that is not contributed to Twisted) that needs it, leave
it in your application for now.

Of course, maybe there can be exceptions to this occasionally, but I
think any exceptions need to be thought about very hard, for the
reasons Glyph pointed out.

Also, sandbox is appropriate for such stuff. e.g., flow.py.

Twisted's head CVS version also works for my actual code.  Thanks!

  Does Ldaptor use NNTP?  I remember thinking "I'll do pipelining when
someone asks for it..." when I did the implementation, and no one ever
asked...

IIRC, the module is called pyPgSQL.PgSQL.. I think you want this:

dbpool = adbapi.ConnectionPool("pyPgSQL.PgSQL", host='localhost', 
user='fig', db='fig')

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Forcing adapter re-registration (patch)
Message-ID: <20030415110038.GH27721@mumak.net>


Woven code uses registerAdapter alot. When developing Woven code, it's
extremely handy to have a couple of 'rebuild' calls in your RPY. (If these
aren't there, the web server must be restarted for code canges to take effect)

However, registerAdapter and rebuild don't play nicely together. On a rebuild,
registerAdapter tries to re-register stuff, and throws an exception. 

Below is a patch that adds an optional keyword parameter 'force' to the
registerAdapter method. If force is set to a true value, registerAdapter should
happily re-register stuff. Otherwise, the current behaviour holds.

The tests work, and I'll quite happily commit if no-one has any problems.

cheers,
jml

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Multiple simultaneous SelectReactors?
Message-ID: <3E9B6206.D3C1C701@engcorp.com>

There appear to be serious problems in several areas of twisted.internet
if one tries to create multiple SelectReactors to use at the same time.

Why would one want to?  For acceptance testing, when it can be desirable 
that the code under test run in the same process as the test code, but
it's not appropriate to share the Reactor.

I'm working on a few fixes, some of which appear to be latent bugs of
various kinds, but I'm still extremely new at Twisted and won't 
immediately be able to provide nice patches and such.

For now, I mainly have these questions:

1. Is Twisted expected to support this in principle, if not currently
in practice?

2. Are the globals "reads" and "writes" that are used in 
twisted.internet.default there solely for optimization purposes, or is
there some more nefarious purpose?  Is it considered absolutely critical
that this optimization is in place?  (If so, it probably makes it 
impossible to fix this limitation of Twisted.)

3. Is it well-known that the abstract.FileDescriptor class does a quiet
little fallback to the global reactor if you don't pass it a reactor reference, 
and that Port fails to pass in its own reactor reference when it creates
a Server object in doRead()?

We've strung together a variety of little changes in the process of 
figuring this out.  Once we're more confident of what we're doing,
I'd be happy to supply the fixes, but I'm not going to waste my time
if everyone thinks SelectReactor.doSelect() absolutely must do those
optimizations.

Also note: I'm working on the most recent released version, not CVS.
The slightest hint that this stuff is significantly changed in CVS 
will send me there, but until now we weren't confident enough with
Twisted to work from unreleased code.  (Actually, attempting to 
resolve this has slightly lowered my confidence in Twisted, but 
only just a bit.)

I think you're approaching this the wrong way.

Rather than forcing it in a particular place in the code, you want to 
force it at a particular time; i.e. when a module is being rebuilt.

Could you instead have a module flag "allowDuplicates" which would be 
set by rebuild and unset when it was finished?

That would be putting it mildly.

I'm aware of this use-case, but it was difficult to write for a variety 
of reasons.  History plays a large role in Twisted's, um, history.  We 
try very hard to support backwards compatibility for many versions, so 
that early adopters do not get burned by quicksand interfaces, and 
sometimes a bit of ugliness results.  This is one of those cases.

As someone new to Twisted, your time would probably be better spent 
coding your acceptance tests to use spawnProcess and actually invoking 
different Python processes for the different components.  It's 
relatively easy to communicate between them once this is done.

> 1. Is Twisted expected to support this in principle, if not currently
> in practice?

Yes.  If you read the CVS logs, you'll notice a trend that more things 
these days take a "reactor" argument than they used to.  We have been 
slowly refactoring towards this for a while.

I would prefer that this optimization remain in place (changes to code 
this far down into the core is a severe problem), but it wasn't 
originally an optimization.  It's present there as a 
backwards-compatibility hack for twisted.internet.main, which is so 
deprecated that you will get sick and die if you even look at it.  It 
can probably be changed at this point.

Yes.  Trust me, this was the best compromise at the time :-).

I would be happier with a simple subclass that was 
slightly-slower-but-multiple-reactor-capable.  However, if you were to 
supply a patch that actually caught all these nuances and fixed them in 
a sensible way, I seriously doubt I would turn it down if you undid a 
tiny (and dubious) optimization :).

The unreleased code doesn't fix this in particular, but it does include 
a LOT of bug fixes.  We are currently struggling to get a release out, 
thanks to the heroic efforts of Kevin Turner.  Hopefully it won't be 
much longer now :).

Sorry to bother you again but I don't understand how to link a QueryIterator

even with a simple exemple, I can't have QueryIterator to work :


  dbpool = adbapi.ConnectionPool("MySQLdb",
                                host=host,
                                db='MYDB',
                                user='USER',
                                passwd='PASS')
  sql = """SELECT nom FROM dbo_questionnaire limit 0,50""" 
  queryIt = QueryIterator(dbpool, sql)

  def res(x): print "Results : ", x
  from twisted.internet import reactor
  f = flow.DeferredFlow(queryIt)
  f.addCallback(res)
  reactor.callLater(2,reactor.stop)
  reactor.run()

Just give me this ouput :

Results : []

sorry, this was a connexion problem. NTL, I can't use QueryIterator with a
consumer. I need a little more help, flow isn't easy to use if you aren't
familiar with deferred, reactors, generators, etc.

This is weird, any exception is raised (try to change a function name in
a consumer).

Thank you..... I 've tried all the day to make it work, but I didn't
succeed :(

But the code above blocks and never exits.

Yes, this works (I've found it this morning). But it's still hard to use
with several producers and consumers.

A little howto would greatly help :)
I can help you, if I understand every thing someday !

Thank you again for your help

This isn't a clear policy.  The primary reason... Twisted is
a framework, and not an application (right?).  Therefore, 
applications shouldn't be part of Twisted (even if they were 
contributed).  So, it really is a chicken and egg.

Perhaps a better policy, if Glyph agrees, then it is in, 
otherwise the necessary conditions for a module to be
added to twisted.* are:
   
   1. the module has three or more end-user applications, from
      at least two different authors, where one of the applications
      (how ever trivial) must be open source so that it's usefulness
      can be highlighted; and

   2. the module complies with the coding standard, and comes
      with a complete coverage test suite; and

   3. the module comes with a documentation and tutorial so
      that it's usage can be understood by others; and

   4.  the module has at least two additional (committer)
       sponsors who think that it is useful to Twisted; and

   5.  the module 'floats' around on the list for at least
       a month or so so that enough people can 'chime' in
       any objections, or so that Glyph can register a veto.


Anyway, it's kinda strict, but it would make for a good basis
for the kind of quality level that we should probably have for
new modules.

But this still doesn't solve the 'bootstrap' issue, that is,
unless the module is checked into CVS, and the documentation
is clearly available, it makes it *very* hard to find users,
and thus to meet the first requirement.

| Of course, maybe there can be exceptions to this occasionally, but I
| think any exceptions need to be thought about very hard, for the
| reasons Glyph pointed out.
| 
| Also, sandbox is appropriate for such stuff. e.g., flow.py.

Yes.  I've found that the sandbox is a great place for this,
as the code isn't officially part of twisted; but yet is in
the CVS and distributed.  

...

However, there are problems with the 'Sandbox'.  The flow.py
file is really three items:

  1.  A new flow.py file in twisted.python
  2.  A small addition to twisted.internet.defer
  3.  A small addition to twisted.enterprise.adbapi
  4.  A small addition to twisted.python.compat (already applied)

So, I'd like to see the 'Sandbox' restructured in such
a way that it takes on a 'recursive diff' shape...

  Twisted/sandbox/flow/twisted/python/flow.py
  Twisted/sandbox/flow/twisted/internet/defer.py.diff
  Twisted/sandbox/flow/twisted/enterprise/adbapi.py.difff
  Twisted/sandbox/flow/test/test_flow.py
  Twisted/sandbox/flow/doc/howto/flow.html

And then having a 'make apply_flow' which will apply the
patches and copy over what would be the result when 
adding flow to the new tree.   In this way people can go
into the sandbox and 'enable' any new additions that they
want.  

I know it's not great, but it would then be clear to 
everyone what a given proposal is.  Most modules in 
the future may not be a simple file... flow isn't, 
despite it's very small size.

Best,

Clark

The error handling is not a strong point of flow.py yet, but
it eventually will be.   Sorry about my last example, you
can't use QueryIterator or ThreadedIterator without using
the reactor... my bad ;)

  dbpool = adbapi.ConnectionPool("MySQLdb",
                                host=host,
                                db='MYDB',

                                passwd='PASS')
  sql = """SELECT nom FROM dbo_questionnaire limit 0,50"""

      query = flow.Generator(QueryIterator(dbpool, sql))
      while 1:
          yield query
          if query.stop: break
          print query.result

  from twisted.internet import reactor
  def finish(result): print result
  f = flow.DeferredFlow(consumer())
  f.addBoth(finish)
  reactor.callLater(2,reactor.stop)
  reactor.run()

Clark,

I think your policy suggestion is a good one.  I don't have an 
immediate yea or nay, but I'm thinking about it.  As to one of the 
things you asked, though:

On Tuesday, April 15, 2003, at 03:26 PM, Clark C. Evans wrote:

> The primary reason... Twisted is a framework, and not an application 
> (right?).

Yes, but then, the things that we characterize as "applications" these 
days are really frameworks.

In the ideal world, Twisted would start up and take over all 
UNIX-networking-y services that you ask it to; a webserver, a mail 
server (POP and SMTP), an IRC server, a rendezvous client and server, 
and a generic PB port that would provide access to all this 
functionality through a better protocol.

Applications would then hook into this environment and provide either 
enhanced versions of infrastructure - say, database-backed message 
storage rather than maildirs - or more frequently, domain objects that 
would do things completely unrelated to infrastructure.  For example, a 
message board, a chatterbot, a knowledge management system, etc.  These 
applications would then hook multiple URIs.  A chatterbot might have an 
IRC nickname as well as an email address, and would respond similarly 
(but not identically) to either.

By having the actual protocols taken over by the infrastructure like 
this, multiple applications (some of them running in different OS-level 
protection domains) can all talk to the same core services at once.  
Two chatterbot instances owned by different users might even converse 
with each other over the core infrastructure layer, either on the same 
host or on different hosts.

The existing codebase obviously doesn't implement terribly much of 
this, but you can see some of it.  Some people consider a web-server an 
"application", but 'mktap web' starts up and serves web pages.  'mktap 
words' starts a chat server.  'im' starts a chat client.  Over time 
these will become more unified and integrated.

To put it simply, "yes, Twisted is a framework, which means it's an 
application".

A release candidate for version 1.0.4 of twisted is now available for

mirror for release distribution; our apologies if our web site gets
slow.

Barring any major problems with this code, it will be released as 1.0.4
final before the end of the week.  Testing on the Windows platform has
been much less extensive than others, so Windows folks, if you could
hammer on this release candidate a bit and report back what you find,
we'd appreciate it.

I solved the problem. It was a missing import (QueryIterator). But any
exception is raised when using flow. It's too hard to debug, even for few
lines of code.

Joe,

Count me in! I've been looking everywhere for code and a tutorial like 
this, so I would very much appreciate a gander at your code.

I am building an application on top of a socket server that speaks 
Flash-friendly XML. Even with my minimal knowledge of Twisted I have 
built a working example on top of the simple echo server. I have a 
nagging feeling that I should be looking at PB instead.

The next step is to add persistence with database calls. Working in a 
strict asynchronous framework is all new to me. But exciting!

Thanks for all the good work,

Doug Goodwin

Hi all,

First of all I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Erik Bakker and i'm a
student at the university of Twente in the Netherlands. I'm working on a
project, in which we would like to use Twisted-python. We are making a
distributed 3D world using OpenGL in python. And we like to use Twisted for
the distribution. We don't need to distribute lots of data, in fact we only
need to distribute the 3D camera position (and only if the 3D camera
changes on input from the user). We would like to broadcast the camera
position to all clients but how is the big question. I can't find anything
in the documentation about broadcasting (except that it is possible:). Now
was our idea that it should be possible with the module UDP from the
internet package, but we can't get it to work.
Now my questions are if it is possible to broadcast using twisted and how.
I'm a bit a newbie in Twisted (yet;-) anybody got any idea's, examples?

Many thanks in advance!

Erik Bakker

It's actually an API-compatible (or near enough) re-implementation, called

There is fledgling Multicast UDP support in Twisted, but I don't think 
anyone has really tried to use it yet.  Are all clients expected to be 
on the same subnet?  If not, multicast or broadcast is probably not 
going to be appropriate.

As far as implementation goes, take a look at the UDP howto, and 
echoclient_udp.py and echoserv_udp.py in doc/examples.  I haven't used 
UDP since the API for using UDP changed, so I can't really help you any 
more than that.

Ok.  I define an Application as a service which provides or

are canidates for inclusion into Twisted.

Right.  Are these applications considered part of Twisted?  For
instance, I can picture an 'Baseball Stat' application which
uses an IRC bot, plus a HTTP interface, etc.   

For contrast, let's say that a IMAP implementation which is part
of Twisted comes with a maildir backend; but then, someone provides
a generic database back end, a layer which maps database structures
onto IMAP requests.  As long as it is 'generic', in that it can work
with more than one set of user content (and thus possibly different
table structures, or with a single but generic table structure),
then I'd consider the database back end Infrastructure.

However, if this database backend maps only to one set of tables,
perhaps specific to a problem domain, I'd consider it part of
the Application.

So, the question is, when does a software component which is 
part of an Application become a canidate for inclusion into
Twisted... I'd say, when it is used by 3 or more Applications,
one of which is open source (which may be trivial, but is used
as an example)

Ok.  I don't really consider the generic web server as an Application,
IMHO, Apache is *not* an application.  Apache plus a content directory
and a given configuration file is an Application.  In this respect,
the configuration of the Webserver is the 'program'.

| To put it simply, "yes, Twisted is a framework, which means it's an 
| application".

A line has to be drawn, I like the idea of calling the stuff outside 
Twisted the Application.  If you define Twisted as an Application, 
then we just need another name for what is outside the line.  I'd
rather not find another name... and the purpose of this discussion
is to draw a distinction for what is in and what is not in Twisted.

For instance, a particular IRC chat client (/w a user interface)
should not be part of Twisted, as it will probably include lots
of specific assumptions as to how a given user would chat.  However,
just about everything that a chat client needs could be a 
canidate for Twisted.

Perhaps what we need is a 'apps' directory in the top level
of Twisted directory (but not in the twisted.* package) where
people can drop in Applications which they would like to share
with the community; but are not necessarly maintained by
the Twisted Community.  

Best,

Clark

Or at least a set of links on the webpage that are more prevalent and 
better maintained than the success stories..  And then there's the 
hybrid of the two, where a sourceforge-like facility could (eventually) 
be provided to open source Twisted applications... but god knows that's 
a pain in the ass to setup.

Maybe when Twisted can host svn, has its own wiki and the bugtracker 
gets better.. who knows?  It'd certainly be a damn good demonstration 
of Twisted if it could run nearly the whole intranet (mail, web, dns, 
bug tracking, source code management, forums, wiki, instant messaging, 
ldap, etc.) of a software development company "out of the box".  I'd 
sure as hell use it, our exim + cyrus + openldap + ldapdns + apache + 
cvs + gforge... etc... setup is a real pain in my ass.

In the webware-sandbox CVS (webware-sandbox.sf.net), in
Sandbox.ianbicking.TwistedWebware, I've put some code to run Webware
under Twisted.  This mostly subsumes the Webware AppServer, with Twisted
handling the threads and sending requests directly to
Application.dispatchRawRequest.

There's certainly some cludges.  There's a minor change to
MiscUtils.Funcs.hostName to accomodate Twisted, so the CVS version of
that file is required.

It's an experiment, because it doesn't actually offer anything we don't
have already.  It would be more interesting if we can use some of the
other protocols that Twisted supports.  I don't yet know how to do that
in Twisted, though.

The flow module should be much better in 'debug' land now
as I think I'm capturing exceptions correctly.  By default,
the DeferredFlow object catches exceptions and uses 
deferred's errback.    It also allows you to pass a 
callable which creates a generator, in case you
forget to use () to invoke.  

If you want the old behavior (compatible with the default
behavior of DeferredList) then use failureAsResult to 
treat failure objects the same as any other result,
returning a list of results to the callback.  

Best,

I have been trying to get the examples in section 2.4 of the HOWTO to work. It 
looks like the documentation is out of date with the current state of the 
software in the CVS. starting with 2.4.2, the "app.theApplication" returns 
the error

I had problems with the examples in section 2.4.3 and 2.5 as well. In section 
2.5 the telnet localhost 4040 command returned a different module location 
instead of twisted.protocols.telnet.ShellFactory and when I ran dir(__main__) 
the list of names did not come close to matching what was in the example. No

I like Interface inheritance, and I don't think anyone has really objected to
it yet.

Maybe you were thinking of the objections to _inheriting of Interfaces_ of
superclasses?

I have :-).

The problem is that currently, it doesn't do what you think.  What most 
people want an interface inheritance to do is make

     class IFoo(Interface): pass
     class IBar(IFoo): pass
     class Bar:
         __implements__ = IBar

be more or less equivalent to

     class IFoo(Interface): pass
     class IBar(Interface): pass
     class Bar:
         __implements__ = IFoo, IBar

Currently this does _not_ happen, because

Does this "DWIM" in Zope?  I have been hesitant to make 
python.components handle it this way, firstly because we didn't realize 
it at first and so it would now be a change in semantics, and secondly 
because it's not clear what effect this would have on registerAdapter.  
Would

     registerAdapter(Bar, Baz, IBar)

also register an adapter for Baz for IFoo?  Why or why not?  What if a 
different adapter was already registered?  I could see that taking 
interface inheritance into account here could be sometimes convenient, 
but it could also be sometimes wrong.  I really have no idea what the 
right answer is, and so leaving it "inconvenient but simple" was easier 
for the time being.

Thank you for the documentation Clark. Here's a little doc patch that just
add some titles and a new part on QueryIterator (which is not good at all

Alex and I have proposed a completely different alternative
to Interfaces, which I think is more Pythonic, and perhaps
may be more generally useful.  I'm not a big fan of Zope's
approach.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] feedback requested -- flow.py goes beta
Message-ID: <20030417160957.GA31818@doublegemini.com>

Abstract: >

   The flow module implements cooperative multi-tasking using
   iterators (easily created with generators) and Twisted's 
   event reactor.   The flow module also includes support for
   incrementally returning query results from Twisted's 
   database connection pool.  While this module does _not_ 
   require generators (a python v2.2 feature), applications 
   of the module are best demonstrated with generators.

Status: >

   The flow module (flow.py) is currently checked into CVS in
   the sandbox directory.  It is unlikely that any large 
   changes to the module will happen.   The documentation 
   is partial, but currently in development.

   General feedback from the Twisted Community is requested.
  
Deployment: >

   If flow was accepted into twisted, I was thinking 
   of spreading its functionality over several files.
   
   1.  Adding a base implementation module, twisted.python.flow,
       which only depends upon other items in twisted.python

   2.  Adding a (fairly small) Flow class to 
       twisted.internet.defer which takes the base
       implementation and uses the reactor and inherits
       from Deferrred.

   3.  Adding a ThreadedIterator class to twisted.internet.threads
       which depends upon twisted.internet.reactor and 
       twisted.python.*
  
   4.  Adding a (fairly small) QueryIterator class to 
       twisted.enterprise.adbapi which depends primarly 
       on ThreadedIterator, but provides for query 
       functionality from a ConnectionPool

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Problem with twisted.web log files
Message-ID: <20030417143134.GC2096@polynode.com>

I'm seeing some strange behavior from twisted.web.

After running "mktap web --logfile=web.log ; twistd -nf web.tap", I get the
following traceback:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/mesozoic/dev/Twisted/bin/twistd", line 31, in ?

  File "/home/mesozoic/dev/Twisted/twisted/web/server.py", line 408, in _openLogFile
    return logfile.LogFile(os.path.basename(path), os.path.dirname(path))

  File "/home/mesozoic/dev/Twisted/twisted/python/logfile.py", line 38, in __init__
    assert os.path.isdir(self.directory)
AssertionError

This does _not_ happen, however, if I run "mktap web --logfile=./web.log"

This problem has only surfaced recently, although I can't say precisely how
long ago.  I am using Twisted out of CVS.

  In this vein, what is the policy on things that are now in CVS but that
are no longer used by anything?

  I know this is trickier, because apps might be relying on them, but we've
got some *really* obscure stuff :)

  For example, twisted.python.reflect.{Settable,Promise,Summer} - completely
unused, except for their tests.

  It'd be nice if we could lose some of this baggage - not right away, but
maybe start with some deprecations now?

Message-ID: <200304172119.44319.jon@totient.demon.co.uk>

When building twisted 1.0.3 on solaris using the sun 'cc' compiler, several of the c extension modules fail because 
of the prescence of '//' for a comment in the code. 

grep -n "\/\/" `find . -name "*.c" -print`

./twisted/internet/cReactor/cDelayedCall.c:126:    // self.time += secondsLater
./twisted/internet/cReactor/cDelayedCall.c:170:    // self.time = time() + secondsFromNow
./twisted/internet/cReactor/cReactorTCP.c:159:    char buf[3*20+3+1+100]; // for good measure
./twisted/internet/cReactor/cReactorTime.c:93:        return NULL; // TODO: set exception?
./twisted/internet/cReactor/cReactorTime.c:125:    //return cDelayedCall_cancel(call, NULL);



please can these be replaced with the /* */ to keep the compiler happy?
I'd fix it myself but dont have CVS access.

I think the gnu compiler is more forgiving, unfortunately solaris cc is not.

cheers

Message-ID: <Pine.SOL.4.44.0304172305520.3390-100000@rac1.wam.umd.edu>

Hey everyone, newbie question:
Are there any Python/Twisted idioms for doing blocking? More specifically,
in a client I have a method to send a query to the server and another
method that gets called when the query is answered. Is there an easy way
to say "send the query then wait x seconds for it to return in this
function"?
It seems like blocking is taboo in twisted and if anyone has an
alternative I'd be glad to hear it. I guess I could do this
asynchronically but it would be a pain I think.
Thanks,
Konrad Rokicki

  Like this, probably:

    d = queryFunction()
    d.setTimeout(x)
    d.addCallbacks(handleAnswer, queryTimedOut)
    reactor.run()

This is what Deferreds are for.  Your client should look something like
this:

    from twisted.internet.defer import Deferred
    from twisted.protocols.basic import LineReceiver
    
    class MyClient(LineReceiver):
        """A very simple protocol that sends one line 'queries', and
        receives one line answers in response.  An answer that startswith
        'Result:' is considered a successful response; anything else is an
        error response."""
        
        def sendQuery(queryString):
            self.sendLine(queryString)
            self.queryDeferred = Deferred()
            return queryDeferred
    
        def lineReceived(line):
            if line.startswith('Result:'):
                self.queryDeferred.callback(line[7:])
            else:
                self.queryDeferred.errback(line)
            self.queryDeferred = None


This is obviously a rather stupid protocol.
    
Then, to perform a query:

    # Assume we've already got a connected MyClient instance in the variable
    # 'myclient'.
    
    # Define a callback and an errback.
    def printResult(result, query):
        print 'Result of query %r is: %r' % (query, result)

    def printFailure(failure, query):
        print 'Query %r failed:' % query
        failure.printTraceback()

    # Send the query
    query = 'query string'
    deferred = myclient.sendQuery(query)

    # Set a timeout
    deferred.setTimeout(10)

    # Attach callback/errback to handle the result
    deferred.addCallback(printResult, query)
    deferred.addErrback(printResult, query)
    
    
See http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/defer for more details on using
Deferreds.  See also the "Writing a Server" and "Writing a Client" howtos.
This is pretty basic Twisted stuff, so the existing docs cover it pretty
well.

  So, there's maybe half a dozen interfaces in twisted.internet.interfaces
that inherit from something other than component.Interface.  Shall I go
ahead and clean these up?

Well, as far as I know, cReactor doesn't really work yet.. and the 
other C extensions don't exhibit this issue.  I'm sure it'll get fixed 
by the time cReactor is actually supposed to work, though :)

Here's my feedback Clark :

I'm testing flow currently. The results I've got with it are wonderful. And
I couldn't do anything without your documentation. This is an important
part of flow. Maybe we should provide a concreate exemple (like Twisted
Quotes) to explain it ?

A little more tests, and flow would be considered as " stable ". I really
hope to see it in Twisted 1.0.5.

I have one question : why did you delete the addBranch method ?

I see the point of Merge (merging 2 or more flows), but what is its opposite
? I mean, if you look at this :

DS1 ----> BLOC1 ---+
                             |
DS2 ----> BLOC2 ---+---- BLOC3 -----> DS3

DS1 and DS2 point the same server, the same db, and the same table. Why use
too connexions instead of one like above ?


DS   ----> BLOC1 ---+
       |                      |
        ----> BLOC2 ---+---- BLOC3 -----> DS3

Maybe it's already on your todo list !? :)

thank you

Detailled information about mappings:

(this is the previous schema)

DS   ----> BLOC1 ---+
       |                      |
        ----> BLOC2 ---+---- BLOC3 -----> DS3

In this exemple, DS has the role to provide data. For that, I use a query.
Let's say:

"Select field1, field2, field3, field4 from MYTABLE"

all field are numerical values.

BLOC1 has to work with field1 and field2
whereas BLOC2 has to work with field3 and field4.

I can split the datasource in 2 connexions. But this a really simple
exemple. If I have 100 BLOCS after the datasources, I may have 100
connexions * Number of Users. Crash ! :)

Am I clearer ?

Message-ID: <20030418150231.GB34406@doublegemini.com>

I've got a user interface question to ask... there are several user
interface improvements possible in flow's operation, here are the 
options:

currently:

  producer = flow.wrap([1,2,3])
  while 1:
      yield producer
      res = producer.getResult() 
      // handle success

  # or, if you wish to handle failures...

  producer = flow.wrap([1,2,3])
  while 1:
      yield producer
      if producer.stop: break
      if producer.isFailure:
          fail = producer.result
          // handle failure
      else:
          res = producer.result
          // handle success
      
We can reduce one line of code by making wrap return
an iterator... which always returns iself.   Thus, the
creation+while loop can be collapsed into a single 
for line.  Unfortunately, this isn't all that intutive
since the item being looped over isn't the result

   for producer in flow.wrap([1,2,3]):
        # same as above, use either form

Another option, which uses for construct,

   producer = flow.wrap([1,2,3])
   yield producer
   for result in producer:
       // handle success
       yield producer

   producer = flow.wrap([1,2,3], raiseFailures = 0)
   yield producer
   for result in producer:
       if producer.isFailure:
           // handle failure
       else:
           // handle success
       yield producer

I'm not sure if this is better... but it does
use the for loop correctly.   There is a variant
which could save one line of code in the yield...

   # done once at the top of the file
   import flow
   flow = flow.Flow()   # create a 'global' flow object


   # done elsewhere...

       yield flow.wrap([1,2,3])
       for result in flow:
           // handle success
           yield flow

This example keeps the 'producer' in a sort-of global
variable so it can be reused.   If you had more than
one producer, you'd have to fall-back on the previous
mechanism.  But for items with a single flow, this
perhaps could be useful.  I don't know, I haven't thought
it through very much.

Another advantage of this second form, is that producer
could sprout a 'peek' method to look at the next result...
but a problem of this method is that each wrapped producer
won't release the current value till the next one is
acquired (or the end of the iteration).   This could be
a problem.. I don't know.

Best,

Clark

Is Glyph's Deferred talk from PyCon online yet?  That might also be 
useful.

krad - You should've just gone to PyCon man, it was right in DC at GWU 
and there were god knows how many talks about various pieces of Twisted.

The only time threads are used in Twisted is if an API that only 
provides a blocking interface must be used.. for example, 
twisted.enterprise uses a threadpool to dispatch queries to DBAPI 
compliant databases, since DBAPI is synchronous and blocking.  The only 
other way around this is to have a pool of worker processes instead of 
worker threads, but you don't really have anything to gain with this 
approach b/c it uses more memory/resources and IPC is slower than 
thread communication.

But yeah, what you want to do is definitely the kind of thing that you 
should be using Deferreds for.. Also, due to the chaining behavior, you 
can do something practical like this:

from twisted.web import microdom, client
# Start webpage fetch
d = client.getPage('http://example.com/somewebpage.html')
# If webpage fetch takes more than aFewSeconds, raise error
d.setTimeout(aFewSeconds)
# Take the web fetch result, and parse it into a DOM tree
# equivalent to saying: microdom.parseString(webFetchResult, 
beExtremelyLenient=1)
d.addCallback(microdom.parseString, beExtremelyLenient=1)
# this will get triggered if the timeout happens, or if there's a parse 
error
# however, with beExtremelyLenient, there usually won't be one.. it can 
parse some f'ed up html
d.addErrback(yourTimeoutOrParseErrorHandler)
# If everything goes OK, or if for some reason 
yourTimeoutOrParseErrorHandler returns a non-Failure result
# call yourPageHandlerThatUnderstandsDOMTrees(result)
# because microdom.parseString was called on the result, it is now a 
DOM tree instead of a string
d.addCallback(yourPageHandlerThatUnderstandsDOMTrees)

Another convenient thing about deferreds is that if the result of some 
callback is a deferred, then it will automagically be chained as 
well... for example, if yourPageHandlerThatUnderstandsDOMTrees wants to

Message-ID: <20030418180733.19039.qmail@green.zadka.com>

Summary:
In PHP 4.3, /usr/bin/php4 is not CGI compatible. Twisted assumes it is.
Currently, the current version in Debian is 4.2, which is why is was not
a problem for most of the core Twisted developers. Others, more "edgy",
operating systems like Gentoo have already begun to feel the repercussions.
I talked to Adam Conrad (infinity on Freenode), who is the Debian PHP
maintainer, about this issu, and relayed his thoughts to glyph.
We actually do need to solve this problem.

Following are the detailed conversation transcripts, mildly edited by
me for formatting.

[re 4.3, on #debian-devel]
<_moshez> but my understanding is that now the default binary thinks it is not a CGI
<_moshez> so doesn't give CGI headers by default
<_moshez> and you need to build with magic flags to force the binary to give CGI headers.
<_moshez> now, when Twisted runs /usr/bin/php <php script>, *it really wants those headers*
<infinity> Twisted should be running /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php4
<_moshez> infinity: does /u/l/c-b/p4-cgi exist in all 4 versions?
<infinity> "All 4"?
<_moshez> infinity: yes. 4.2.xs
<infinity> Oh.  Yes.
<infinity> It exists all the way back to potato's 4.0.3
<infinity> _moshez : Various dists may package it differently, so if this an upstream thing, I'm not sure how best to deal with it.  But in Debian, it always has been, and always will be in /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
<_moshez> infinity: I'll see what my upstream thinks, and if necessary I'll change it in my scripts
<_moshez> infinity: the important thing for me is to be woody-compatible
<infinity> _moshez : In fact, with 4.3, /usr/bin/php{,4} will be even less
+CGI-compatible than it is now, so make sure to use the CGI one. :)
<_moshez> infinity: I know that :)
<_moshez> infinity: this is why I wanted this cleared before 4.3 :)
<infinity> _moshez : Well, if this is for an httpd, a suggests might be nice,
<_moshez> infinity: I may use Suggests: in twisted-web, then.

[on #twisted]
<_moshez> glyph: <infinity> Twisted should be running /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php4
<_moshez> glyph: this is only guaranteed to be the location for Debian, though
<_moshez> glyph: I can deal with it in my scripts, or we can change it upstream
+then.  (I wish Enhances worked, I'd use it all over)
* _moshez notes nobody commented yet on his ITP
<glyph> _moshez: If you need to change it, upstream should have a way to configure it.  I imagine this is sufficiently variable that it should be an argument to mktap web
<_moshez> glyph: *you're* upstream
<_moshez> glyph: whatever you decide is fine by me...
<glyph> _moshez: I'm not going to fix PHP scripting right now, I do have more valuable things to be doing with my time :)
<glyph> _moshez: but that's what I recommend the solution to be.
<_moshez> glyph: if radix decides it's not worth his time, he should decide to either "leave as is" or "change to Debian default"
<_moshez> glyph: either of those would satisfy me
<glyph> _moshez: okay
<glyph> _moshez: could you write about this to the list, actually?
<glyph> _moshez: I think that we should have the issue talked about there, good raw material for a FAQ

I did a little bit of research into the issue yesterday, when someone 
asked on IRC.. basically what happened is that PHP now has two types of 
executables.  Unfortunately, the one that goes into /usr/bin is to be 
used to write actual PHP applications in -- under NO circumstance will 
these PHP binaries will print headers, regardless of argv.  The other 
one is to be used from cgi-bin.  The other binary, which may or may not 
exist, WILL print headers by default, but can suppress them if -q is on 
the argv.

IMHO, this is *retarded* and the PHP developers should be smacked 
upside the head for this.  Why not add a flag that ALLOWS headers to be 
printed?  At most, it scrapes some modicum of support code out of the 
binary, and 4 CPU cycles out of the option parsing.. what are they 
smoking?  Why does PHP need TWO binaries?  Couldn't they have just made 
the commandline one have a different name, symlink to the cgi binary, 
and have the cgi binary check argv[0] to see if it should assume -q or 
not?!?

Ok.  Thanks to extrepum's suggestions, flow can now use the
for loop.  Also, it handles exceptions in a cleaner way.  
For more details, see

   http://clarkevans.com/flow.html

flow.py, test_flow.py, and flow.html are currently 
checked into the Twisted CVS.

Best,

Clark

Hey, you broke my code!  Fortunately, you did it after the release
candidate, so I don't have to kill you.  Sorry I didn't have a unit test
in for it before, I do now (test_util.GetPasswordTest).  The behaviour I
was depending on *was* fully specified by the docstring though, which
you blatantly changed.

I can understand why for conch you would want a way of grabbing a
password from the terminal while leaving stdin undisturbed, but that's
not what this function did.  It allowed for a password to be passed in
to stdin so that scripts could set passwords without doing it on the
command line, because command line arguments show up in the process
table which is way too public on many systems.

I'm going to revert your change to python.util, please feel free to add
this functionality in another way (perhaps with a new function or
parameter) that does not break documented behaviour.

Thanks,

 - Kevin

Speaking of PHP support, are there any plans for FastCGI?  Seeing at least a
10x performance increase in PHP would be nice.

#
# Why flow?
#
#   The flow module provides a mechanism for delivering incremental
#   results and performing long computations in a manner which 
#   cooperates with other simoutaneous requests.
#
#   In this example are two data sources, one of which simulates
#   a long-computation which is made to cooperate with other 
#   requests, and the other which blocks, perhaps simulating a 
#   database result that delivers content in small chunks as it 
#   pages through the query results.
#
#   Using these two data sources is a simple HTML web page,
#   which weaves the data together onto a single output
#   stream, via request.write  
#
# Why not Deferreds?
#
#   One could use deferreds, however, in the first, cooperative
#   example, one would really have to use a thread or break the
#   computation down into very small deferred chunks (where one
#   really isn't necessary with the flow module).   And, in the
#   second, either you'd need a deferred for each row (or chunk
#   of rows), or the results could not be incrementally delivered.  
#   And, further, the HTML page generation would have to be broken
#   up into several 'stages' which were executed after each
#   other.   Furthermore, if more than one 'database' query
#   was to be used, the deferreds from them would have to
#   be synconized; or, you could not execute the queries
#   in parallel (one on a different database node, for 
#   example).  In any case, I don't think it'd be as 
#   pretty as this...  or am I missing something?

It shouldn't be too hard to write if you're interested in it.
Read the twisted/web/twcgi.py code to see how all of this is done
now. If you do write, we may integrate it into Twisted -- but
note that Twisted works just fine with 3rd party Resources and modules.
Most of the Twisted do not use CGI enough that this become a problem.

If we are going to sit around talking about everything for which this 
is true, we could be talking about PHP for a long, long time :).  
Thanks to those of you who did the research to get this working again.  
It's unnerving that the behavior of these versions is different, 
however, if we're going to have to start inserting options about which 
binary to use, FastCGI support, et. al. for PHP, perhaps we should have 
a --with-php=... option for mktap web?  Debian can provide a sensible, 
working default, but I have a feeling that other installations 
(/usr/local/bin seems popular for PHP users, especially if they *were* 
using apache and are *now* using Twisted with their PHP setup) will 
have problems.

Wouldn't most Apache users use mod_php4?  Personally, my PHP lives in
/zeus/php/php.fcgi :)  I keep the CLI version as /usr/local/bin/php.

When to use flow?

  For simple processes which can be broken down into
  a small set of chunks, then Deferred is the best way
  to go.  To make it worth while to use flow, you need
  one of the following:

    a) incremental results: for example, a big or slow
       executing database query that needs to process
       results as they become available.
 
    b) merging or splitting: for example, having two
       database queries running in parallel, the
       results being merged together

    c) complicated chunking: if your deferred chunks
       start to get numerous or have non-trivial logic
       in them, then flow would be useful.

    d) intensive computations: if your process has
       computations that need to be broken into
       chunks, then flow may be better than deferreds.

Recent changes:

   I renamed flow.ThreadedIterator to flow.Threaded,
   as it is now a wrapper (you don't inherit).

Fellow twisters,

I have finally read all that seemed necesary to get a good feel of
twisted! and I have finally been able to implement a few 'play'
programs.

I have a project I'd like to write, and I have always tought about it in
the normal "use a library" fashion (in oppisition to the "use a
framework").  My idea is to create a program that is a tournament
manager, it works kind of like this:

	* Accepts connections (there are 2 types, admin, regular).
		* Listen to the admin connection
			- Start tournament at admin's command 
			  This would create tournament brackets and actually give the
			  connected players the "play" command.
			- View current games
			- A bunch of other things :)

Then when the admin starts the games, the program would spun a new "game
thread" that would have the game logic, and that would keep track of the
game (check legality of moves), tell player A to go, tell B what A play,
tell B to go, decide on the winner, etc.

But now I find my self trying to think twisted. I am no longer in
control of the main program loop it seems.  I see how I can keep some of
my static info (having my Protocols register them in the Application).
What I'm having a hard time with is envisioning how to get my games
started, and how to keep track of them.  
* Where does my game-logic go?
* Do my protocols check for valid moves... if so, who keeps track of the
  board? The board is a share resource between 2 players of a short
  amount of time, and there are potentially many games going on at the
  same time.
* How can I implement timeouts?  So that players have to play within 
  given time-limits?  (like, X seconds per-move kinds of deals?)  I
  thougt about starting a timer in my Protocol when a "MAKE A MOVE"
  command is sent to the player, and then checking that time when the
  move is received... but this seems to involve threads?

Anyway, I'd really would appreciate your thoughts on this.  This
'higher-design' stuff is keeping me from getting dirty :)

Thanks.

I'd say there's two types of *users*.  There's no need to listen on
different ports, it's just a matter of who they authenticate as.

I think you want a TournamentService, see
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/pb-cred for details of using
Services in the context of PB, but hopefully you can get something out of it
even if you don't use PB.  See doc/examples/pbecho.py for an example of a
simple service.  Basically, it's:

    from twisted.internet.app import Application
    from twisted.cred.service import Service
    from twisted.cred.authorizer import DefaultAuthorizer

    class TournamentService(Service):
        """Game logic goes here"""

    myApp = Application('Tournament')
    auth = DefaultAuthorizer(myApp)
    svc = TournamentService('Tournament', myApp, auth)
    myApp.listenTCP(1234, YourProtocolFactory(svc))
    myApp.run()

I'd have a TournamentService keeping tracking of all the games running at
any time in a dict mapping players to a board.  So when a player sends a
move, the service looks up the player's board, and tells the board what that
player X wants to play move Y, and the board then accepts that or raises an
exception.  It's the board that knows what moves can be played at any given
time; the protocol's job is merely to pass messages to and from the player
on the network.

There's plenty of stuff built into Twisted for doing timeouts already, that
doesn't involve threads or anything icky.

You can use reactor.callLater, as described here:
   http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/howto/time

Depending on what you're doing, you may also find the setTimeout method of
Deferreds to be useful.

I hope I've made it clearer for you.  Let us know if you're still unsure
about something.

[I think someone wrote a tic-tac-toe example, which might help a little
here... does anyone know where that is?]

Sorry about that.  There are two ways to make Threaded the threaded
wrapper operate.  In one case, the default, the wrapper yields for
every time that the wrapped iterator has returned.  In the other,
it assumes that the wrapped iterator returns a lists, and then 
yields for each item in those lists.

When I split QueryIterator and Threaded, there wasn't a way to 
let Threaded know that QueryIterator wants the second behavior,
so to do that you need to use the 'extend' option:

   flow.Threaded(flow.QueryIterator(...), extend = 1)

Anyway, I assume you are using the defaults, fetchall=0 for the 
QueryIterator, and extend = 0, for the Threaded wrapper.  In this
case, you could get N yields with M rows in them.  This is probably
the most efficient mechanism, as you spend less time in the flow
module, yet the results are incremental.

Right, and if your result set had more rows you'd get...

Although, to make it easier for programming, the 
extend = 1 option would make it return results...

Subject: [Twisted-Python] UDP servers and socket queues
Message-ID: <20030421142657.GB7900@wildfire0.net.ic.ac.uk>

All,

I'm porting an app over which had it's own async job thingy, similar to
Twisted's most basics - I now want it to run as a long-running server
with multiprotocol support, and Twisted is the logical choice.

The core of the app is a UDP-based RPC client (bespoke stuff) which does
a periodic flurry of activity (plus on-demand stuff - that's the plan
for later anyway).

The problem is that the flurry of activity fills the UDP socket queue,
and I think some simple changes to SelectReactor (which I've done
locally via a nasty/messy subclass) which could be useful to others will
fix it:

from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.internet import client

class RPCProtocol(protocol.DatagramProtocol):
    def __init__(self);
        # setup some icky stuff for retries etc here

    def datagramReceived(self, data, addr):
        pdu = self._decode(data)
        dfurred = self.outstanding[pdu.uuid]
        del self.outstanding[pdu.uuid]
        dfurred.callback(pdu)

    def sendPDU(pdu, addr):
        self.outstanding[pdu.uuid] = defer.Deferred()
        self.writeMessage(pdu.encode(), addr)
        return self.outstanding[pdu.uuid]

class endpoint:
    def __init__(self, protcol, host):
        self.protocol = protocol
        self.addr = resolve(host)
        self.actions = load_from_config(host)

    def go(self):
        pdu = self.create_pdu(self.actions.pop(0))
        self.protocol.sendPDU(pdu, self.addr).addCallback(self.handle)

    def handle(self, pdu):
        func = self.actions.pop(0)
        func(pdu)
        pdu = self.create_pdu(self.actions.pop(0))
        self.protocol.sendPDU(pdu, self.addr).addCallback(self.handle)
        
Anyway, you get the idea. The code fires up, and you get:

proto = RPCProtocol()
for host in hosts:
    ep = endpoint(proto, host)
    ep.go()

...the problem is that the responses come back too fast - they overflow
the UDP socket buffer after a couple of hundred packets. So, try this:

proto = RPCProtocol()
for host in hosts:
    ep = endpoint(proto, host)
    reactor.callLater(0, ep.go)

...except that the default SelectReactor will always execute any
pendingTimedCalls before calling doIteration (where the select() call
actually happens).

Ok, so inherit from SelectReactor and override mainLoop - except that
doIteration will only execute one doRead for each ready socket (there's
one socket - there are potentially thousands of hosts and I don't want
to overload either select()'s performance characteristics with the
number of fd's or the fd limit).

My old code did this:

while running:
    while 1:
        rs, ws, xs = select.select([self.fd,], [], [], self.timeout())
        if self.fd in rs:
            self.doRead()
        else:
            break
    for p in self.pending:
        p()

...i.e. empty the socket queue before doing *any* callback activity. I
can do this with a suitable reactor - it's just messy. Is it worthwhile
a flag in the core SelectReactor to change the preferences for
network/callback behaviour and the rate of network activity?

Just a thought.

Twisted is excellent work - keep it up!

Phil

Have you tried doing reactor.callLater(smallFloatButNotZero, ep.go)?  
If you use a small number it typically won't happen in that iteration.

I'll take a look at trying to fix this sometime this week. The solution
will be to do up to X reads of UDP packets in each iteration of the
event loop, instead of reading only one packet in each iteration.

I figured something like that. Does anyone know if the various socket
readiness abstractions (select(), poll(), kqueue, RT signals, etc.)
given you sufficient information to know when you can do multiple reads?

The other option I guess would be to for connection-less sockets to do:

while 1:
    try:
        data, addr = self.socket.recvfrom(65535)
        self.protocol.datagramReceived(data, addr)
    except socket.error, se:
        if se.args[0]==errno.EWOULDBLOCK:
            break
    except:
        log.deferr()

...in doRead (line 91, twisted/internet/udp.py)?

On second thoughts, (having just tested it) that alone won't be
sufficient, although it does make things a lot cleaner. The problem also
is:

proto = RPCProtocol()
for host in hosts:
    ep = endpoint(proto, host)
    reactor.callLater(0, ep.go)

...the in mainLoop of SelectReactor (or rather the subclass which reads
from the network *first*):


while self.running:
    try:
        while self.running:
            # Still need to reverse the order of the read
            # versus the call of functions
            t2 = self.timeout()
            t = self.running and t2
            self.doIteration(t)
            # Advance simulation time in delayed event
            # processors.
            self.runUntilCurrent()
    except:
        log.msg("Unexpected error in main loop.")
        log.deferr()
    else:
        log.msg('Main loop terminated.')

...the runUntilCurrent will execute *all* the callLater's that are
queued, which takes a couple of seconds (say) - however, halfway though
the runUntilCurrent, a sufficient number of replies has been returned to
overflow the socket input buffer - so you still need to somehow limit
the amount of work done in runUntilCurrent.

Now, I could put "reactor.callLater(when, ep.go)" then "when += 0.1" but
as the process runs more callLaters will happen, will pile up against
each other, and eventually the same problem will likely occur.

Interesting behaviour though!

Hi.  I intend to become a Twisted novice.  At the beginning of the road, I

Yeah, you weren't logged on, so there was no currentAccount (i.e., it was set 
to None). If you want, you can add a check to say "if not self.currentAccount"
and pop up a nice dialog with an error message :-)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted 1.0.4 - `html' .vs. `xhtml'
Message-ID: <oqof2zjtuo.fsf@titan.progiciels-bpi.ca>

Hello.

In the `doc/' hierarchy of the Twisted 1.0.4 distribution, some `.html'
files have links to `.xhtml' files, where apparently `.html' files by the
same base exist.  Should `.html' rather point to `.html' files whenever
possible?  Here are possible points to visit:

* `doc/index.html' has references to `howto/index.xhtml', 'man/index.xhtml',
  `specifications/index.xhtml' and `vision/index.xhtml'.

* `doc/howto/woven.html' refers to `listings/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.html'
  correctly, yet the text says `Listing 2: HelloWorld.xhtml...' which does
  not exist; it also refers to `listings/TwistedQuotes/WovenQuotes.xhtml'
  and says so in the text, yet sadly, there is no corresponding `.html' file.

* `doc/howto/domtemplate.html' refers to `TwistedQuotes/WebQuotes.xhtml',
  while the text which announces `Listing 2: WebQuotes.html...', and sadly,
  the reference is correct while the text is not.

* `doc/howto/lore.html', `doc/api/private/twisted.lore.default.html' and
  `doc/api/public/twisted.lore.default.html' also seem to indicate that
  `lore' will generate `.xhtml'; I am not familiar with `lore', and cannot
  say if it should or can generate `.html' instead.  If it can, it most
  probably should for generated documents to pointed to by `.html' files.

P.S. - I'm using `links' by preference (fast startup and reasonable image
support), which `links' does not seem to support `.xhtml' files.  Given that
`.html' is pretty widespread and reasonably understood by all Web browsers,
while `.xhtml' is more recent or specialised, would not it be a good idea to
aim `.html' as a uniform standard base for interactive documentation, (given
it ought to go through Web browsers), and offer `.xhtml' merely as an extra?

Hi, people.

In Twisted 1.0.4, file `doc/howto/domtemplate.html' has this line:

I was expecting a demonstration of some sort.  `links' gave me a traceback,
which is likely not the correct output.  For this message, I wanted a copy
of that output (`links' does not seem to support mouse cuts), so I tried:

For my own taste, the first (latex2html) is a bit more legible, because it
has less distracting boxes, and the diagrams are more neat.  The navigation
bars at the beginning and the end give a bit of decoration, outside the
text, which is OK.  We should stay aware that "good looking" is only of
secondary value for documentation, legibility always goes before art.

By saying so, you reveal a prejudice towards the second (Lore).  :-)

I'm a newcomer to Twisted, and `im' is suggested right in the `README', that
is, really early in the adventure of discovering Twisted.  It would probably
be worth that Twisted polishes the first impressions it creates, or else,
that explanations like above be added to the `README' file. :-)

In that respect, what I want is a somewhat irrelevant.  Let's use some good
horse sense.

Yes, the '.html' should link to '.html'.  They '.html' files are the source

This is actually a known problem (someone else reported this a couple of

Lore's default behaviour is '.html' -> '.xhtml'.  If you are reading the
docs, just ignore the .html files and read the .xhtml, which are nicer
anyway.

I suspect links is probably having problems with the lack of <!DOCTYPE ...>
declarations in the .xhtml files, which is a bug in microdom.  Hopefully
this will be fixed soon.

Do we need something like <a href="foo.html" munge="Don't!">...</a> ?

Maybe, but so far, no.  Lore doesn't munge links with / in them at the
moment, which is usually plenty.

I'm actually intending on changing that to munging all relative links, or
perhaps all relative links under the current working directory (but that
seems a touch too magical).  If I do that, then a class="no_munge" is
probably justified -- although I'd prefer a better name for it :)

Hello everyone! Newbie question. I need to make a blocking call in

So, in your opinion, any browser which does not grok `.xhtml' is not real?
Happily enough, my preferred non-real browser is very useful as it stands,
and it seems that `.xhtml' is still exceptional rather than the usual in
real life, for a tremendous lot of people.  Ah, religions, religions... :-)
I hope Twisted is its own goal, and not an occasion for random proletysm!

	It should do this already, in any case. It's a bug it doesn't.
	select/poll/etc only give a hint that the fd might be

Hmm. Without going into irrelevant detail, I'm certain the UDP is the
appropriate protocol for this application, for a number of reasons, but

Well, links could be more intelligent here, and it seems other browsers
manage to figure this out just fine.  Neither the presence of a <!DOCTYPE
...> declaration or the opening <html> tag seem sufficient for links to
realise that it is dealing with actual HTML.  Additionally, I wasn't able to
successfully configure my local links to recognise .xhtml as being
html/plain content, even though the menus seemed to suggest I could (it
happily accepted the entry, but the behaviour was unchanged).

I don't regard it as a major problem, though: in links you can hit "\" and
then it works.  Other browsers I've tried all seem fine -- as is links if
you are reading it off the website, which of course sets the Content-type
HTTP header.  Considering that you are the first person to report this
problem, I doubt this is worth the effort for us to "fix".  

You are welcome to locally rename or symlink the .xhtml files to .html if
you're really inconvenienced by this ;)

Or you can read the .ps or .pdf format -- or read it from the website, which
works around links' limitations.

> I hope Twisted is its own goal, and not an occasion for random proletysm!

The true goal of Twisted is to DESTROY THE SUN, of course.  Random proletysm
is merely a distraction we create so that no-one will stop us!  Muahahahaha!

:-) :-).  I begin to see that Twisted has (or nearly has) all the needed
machinery towards this noble goal.  There surely is a lot of stuff
in there!  Yet, I guess I'll have to read some more before I can figure
out how to cleverly connect various parts towards the goal.  Beware! :-)

Yes, you can return a Deferred from a perspective_ method and it will
do the right thing.

Also, you can do something like this

    def perspective_X(self):
        #doSomeOperation here returns a Deferred
        return doSomeOperation().addCallbacks(self.mungeIt, self.ohCrap)

... And implement mungeIt and ohCrap to take the result, munge it in some
useful way, and return it. The return value will be used as the result
on the client side (who originally did callRemote('X'))
This way you can do some processing on the result of your operation
before the client gets it, if you need to.

No no no no. getgrall could theoretically return a *huge* number of
groups, and/or individual groups could have *huge* numbers of members.
For a system with /etc/passwd and /etc/group only, this doesn't matter,
but think about a system with an LDAP (RFC2307) nameservice backend - I
just tested it on my machine, and getgrall results in over 48Mb of
LDAP queries based on our ActiveDirectory groups. Many tens of seconds.

However, calling initgroups results in a single query:

memberUid=foo

...and only returns the groupname and gid, so is efficient every time.
The "right" way to do this is the getgrouplist() call (see
http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=getgrouplist) and if you
look at the NSS code in e.g. glibc the NSS modules can provide
"efficient" hooks which initgroups() and getgrouplist() can implement.
initgroups() in glibc basically calls getgrouplist() on the NSS plugin
and so whilst the *result* is the same, you're taking the slow path.

This is important - don't use the sucky getgrent (in fact, I'm an
advocate of making the gr_mem member of the "struct group" always be
null. Just because other apps do it is no exscuse either :o)

	Certainly you are correct. The point you are missing is
	that we are programming in Python, not in C. And Python does
	not have initgroups.

	We could add initgroups into eunuchs
	(http://twistedmatrix.com/users/tv/eunuchs/), or use the
	initgroups module by one of the Twisted developers; the code
	could be rewritten to try importing the C part, and falling
	back to the dumb version. Then using the smart API would be a
	true optimization.

	However, before I touched it, the code did _NOTHING_ unless
	the C initgroups module was available. And that resulted in
	bad things.

	getgrouplist() is as much missing from python stdlib as
	initgroups(), so you aren't really helping there.

with merge :[1,Cooperate(),2] + [3,4] = [1,3,4,2]
with zip, it should be [1,Cooperate(),2] + [3,4] = [(1,3)(2,4)]


Hmm, By the way, Cooperate() isn't clear, even with the doc... :-(
could you explain me that please ?

thx
Philippe

I'm not yet a Twisted user, but intend to use it over two sites, (and maybe
a third withinin a few months).  All sites run Python 2.2.1 or better.

No, Python 2.1 needs to die, slowly and painfully.

Forgive my confusion, but why isn't this sort of thing entirely up to the
server? Shouldn't the client merely obey the Content-Type: header?

I'm willing to believe it's more confusing than that, both because I've seen
it break and because I've seen the zillion mapping preferences in web
browsers, but I'd love to know how it's *supposed* to work before all the
band-aids got applied. In-line magic numbers like <html> or <!DOCTYPE> are
what MIME was supposed to get rid of.

The problem they're talking about is when you `links' a *local* file, so no
mime-type information is available.

We currently are using Twisted (just upgraded to 1.0.4) along with Zope 2.5.1,
Zope for the "front end" (but only for as long as it takes until we can remove it)
and Twisted for the "back end" of our application.  Zope still uses Python 2.1
so we would be unable to do this with Python 2.2.  Since we will definitely
have excised all traces of Zope by the time anything really changes with
Twisted and 2.2, I'm not seriously concerned but I thought I'd note it as
an interesting data point.

Also perhaps interesting, though off-topic, is that we patched 1.0.3 to
run under Python 2.0 (just a few quick hacks) successfully, as we are
still using that on our network for development, even though this one
particular application deploys with Python 2.1.  It was rather simple
with 1.0.3 although I'm not sure whether we'll have better or worse
luck when we try this with 1.0.4.  Chances are the nested scopes have
propagated throughout more of the code now...

> 2. Do you have any Twisted success stories you'd like to share (besides

Eventually we will have something more official to report, but just for
this list, unofficially :-), for now, I'd like to report that Kaval
Wireless Technologies Inc (www.kaval.com) is integrating Twisted into a 
server application which is used to monitor equipment in wireless coverage 
extension systems.  (The monitoring links themselves are not wireless, so Twisted
is carrying only data which travelled as electrons, not as radio waves...)

Until now we'd been using Zope, but it was really not the most appropriate
choice since this isn't a content management system.  Twisted appears
more robust, lighter weight, and likely to prove much more amenable to
rapid development on our end, and as a hardcore XP team we highly
appreciate the XP approach of the Twisted team and look forward to
contributing as we learn more.  I don't want to diminish Zope, which
provided an effective platform at an earlier stage, but we've definitely
grown beyond it and are tightly constrained by its limitations and
difficult development model.

I am writing clone of my worknode in C++, so Twisted version is used
just until I complete C++ version. This is because of productivity
concerns, I have hit Python's productivity ceiling. After that I may
succeed in writing cluster kernel and web interface in Twisted. I.e.
still no success story, sorry.

Have you considered using something like BOOST.Python or Pyrex to do 
optimized implementations of the portions that have poor performance?  
Typically, rewriting the whole thing in C/C++ is a bad idea.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] newbie -- trying to do async ldap operations
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.51.0304221724530.3672@garp.ucs.indiana.edu>

First to set my perspective -- I never heard of Twisted before two days
ago.

I have an XMLRPC server built with the Medusa framework.  I am looking at
moving the methods to Twisted in order to take advantage of Deferreds, SSL
support, and based on my brief exposure, the overall framework seems
cleaner.

This is a simplification, but to keep this short I have an XMLRPC method
that returns results from an LDAP search.  Currently the searches are
synchronous but they are fast enough that it has not been a problem.  Now
I need to expand the search filter options which will (could) result in a
slower search.

The OpenLDAP API (and python-ldap) supports asynchronus searching.  Sounds
perfect.  A call to ldap.search_s() returns a message ID which is later
used in a call to result() to get the results.  ldap.result() takes the
message ID, and a timeout argument which if zero is in effect a poll.

So what I want is for my XMLRPC method to invoke search_s and get the
message ID.  Then create a defered and provide its callback and the
message ID to something that will poll ldap.result() until it returns
results (if results are not ready it will return [None, None]) and then
pass those to the callback.  Here's where I get confused; I think the call
to ldap.result() needs to be done by reactor somehow since ldap.result()
may need to be called repeatedly before results are ready) but I'm not
sure.

The whole deferred light bulb has not quite come on for me yet, so I
appreciate any guidance.  The defer HOWTO examples all use something like
reactor.callLater() to represent a "delayed result" which is not really
helping me.  The XMLRPC example of returning a defered just returns
defer.succeed("hello"), again not quite a rich enough example.

I thought about adapting the adbapi stuff for LDAP, but the notion is in
my head that I should be able to do this without threads since the ldap
API supports async operations.

Many thanks,

Allan

Arte you using them in the same process? Or as separate processes? Any
reason you can't install two versions of Python at once?

Eek, polling is terrible. You should check out Tv's Ldaptor for Twisted:
http://twistedmatrix.com/users/tv/ldaptor/
It's a natively-Twisted LDAP client library.

Also (it's moot if you'll use ldaptor, which I recommend, but..), returning the
message ID as the result of the Deferred, and requiring the caller to poll,
is a bad idea. You would do the polling yourself (every iteration of the
mainloop, with a reactor.callLater(0, pollIt) or somesuch), and once the
result is available, trigger the Deferred with it.

Message-ID: <20030422233938.GA4946@localhost.localdomain>

Twisted 1.0.4
Linux Redhat 9.0

I have evidence of the SerialPort class blocking.  

strace says write operations are blocking and always return the number
of bytes to be written.

The problem goes away if I set the file descriptor on the object to
non-blocking using posixy controls.

Test program below.

Cooperate() is called when an iterator would block, thus,
the flow module allows other tasks (connections, users)
to continue.   If you look at the source for flow.Threaded
you will see that it raises Cooperate() when the database
hasn't produced data yet.

  Here's something that might help (note that I am not familiar with the
python-ldap API, so I'm just guessing at how it is laidd out):

    from twisted.internet import reactor, defer

    class LDAPQueryTracker:
        def __init__(self):
            self._ids = {}

        # Wrapper around python-ldap's search function
        # returns a Deferred whose callback will be invoked
        # with the result
        def search(self, args):
            id = ldap.search_s(args)
            self._ids[id] = defer.Deferred()
            reactor.callLater(0, self.poll)
            return self._ids[id]

        # A method to poll any "live" queries,
        # and to schedule another poll if there are any
        # remaining outstanding queries
        def poll(self):
            for (id, d) in self._ids.items():
                r = ldap.result(id, timeout=0):
                if r is not None:
                    del self._ids[id]
                    d.callback(r)
            if self._ids:
                reactor.callLater(0, self.poll)

    # Two trivial callbacks to handle the result
    def printResult(result):
        print 'LDAP result:', result
    def printFailure(failure):
        print 'LDAP failed!'
        failure.printTraceback()

    # Make a tracker, perform a query, and add some callbacks
    qt = LDAPQueryTracker()
    d = qt.search("humm, I have no idea what an ldap query looks like")
    d.addCallbacks(printResult, printFailure)

    # Do it.
    reactor.run()


  Hope this helps,

Thanks, Jp, your example is helpful.  I will give it a try.

(Note to other readers -- ldap.search_s() is the synchronous (blocking)
method.  The async method is ldap.search().  I've been using
ldap.search_s() up until now and my fingers automatically typed that.)

I saw that and downloaded the latest .tar.gz, but it was not immediately
obvious how it worked.  There seemed to be no documentation -- did I miss
it?  I'll peruse through the code a bit more; I'm all for not reinventing
the wheel, but on the other hand I'm very happy with the python-ldap
wrappers for the OpenLDAP API -- they've worked flawlessly for me so far.

Yes, that's what I was trying to say.  I probably did not say it well.
Thanks.

I checked in some changes to UDP in CVS that may very will improve

there's any difference?

Code for a UDP throughput benchmark would also be much appreciated.

Perusing the code/design of iperf may be useful for whoever does this.
Those of us who routinely do very high speed data transfers (1GBit+
streams) use iperf regularly to ensure the end-to-end performance
characteristics of the path.

Just as a point of pedanticism, what happens if you configure your 
local links to recognise .xhtml as "text/html" rather than "html/plain"?

Good question.

Answer: still no luck.

(Incidentally, I tried "html/plain" because of the "Toggle html/plain    \"
entry in the View menu, which made it render the page properly.)

Same process.  Rewriting as two processes, communicating via

On Debian woody (stable), Python/GTK+ is available only for Python 2.1.
This means woody users would not be able to use the GUI clients in Twisted
(some of which are GTK+-based). In addition, other libraries which specific
developers might wish to use might be unavailable for Python 2.2. I can
probably conjure up a list of such libraries.

I've already made my position clear on IRC, but figured it should be
documented here as well :)

The book is a collaboration of many Twisted developers.
Andrew and I are responsible for making the book out of the various

My apologies - I thought the discussion was *about* the use or non-use
of the initgroups C module, rather than what to do in the absence. My
bad.

Has any thought been given to a PEP for adding initgroups() and/or
getgrouplist() to the Python standard "group" module?

You're right, those examples were ancient. I've updated them to match the

	There's no HOWTO-style documentation (because *I* don't
	usually want to read such, so I don't want to write it), but
	there current head of the tree actually has decent
	docstrings. Here's a few links:

	API Docs: http://tv.debian.net/software/ldaptor/api/

	Main site: http://tv.debian.net/software/ldaptor/

	See the latest code: http://ldaptor.bkbits.net/



	There's also *13* example client apps, as of now.

	The search utility should be reasonably obvious:

	You also have this great mailing list to ask questions on.

  I have some code I can use to test this, I'll post results when I get a
chance.

  An apparent problem, though.  On Windows, under Cygwin:

    File "C:\cygwin\home\amir\Twisted\twisted\internet\udp.py", line 39, in ?
      from errno import WSAEAGAIN as EAGAIN
    ImportError: cannot import name WSAEAGAIN  File "C:\cygwin\home\amir\Twisted\twisted\internet\udp.py", line 39, in ?

| Ho well. So, Cooperate() is a kind de defered (for flows) ?

Well, Cooperate is the whole reason for flow... otherwise you
could just use recursive generators.   Basically, in one of 
your generators (Threaded(QueryIterator())), your code would 
block waiting for a row, etc.  So rather than blocking, Threaded
returns Cooperate.   This return value is handled by the wrappers
all the way up the call chain.  At the top of the call chain is
Deferred, and when Deferrerd gets a Cooperate, it does a 
callLater(0, self), so that other processes can run.  


Suppose you have generator X -> Y -> Z, the picture 
then looks like...

     Wrap  <--  Z
      |
      v
     Wrap  <--> Y
      |   
      v
     Wrap  <--> X
      |
      V
     Deferred
      |
      V
     reactor

So, rather than X talking to Y, talking to Z, each of
your generators is talking to a wrapper instead, which
tries to be as transparent as possible.   The 
wrapper has the following behavior:

    0.  If a value is returned from a generator to 
        a wrapper, it is given to the previous generator
        in the chain; at the bottom of the chain it is
        added to an array which is sent to the deferred's
        callback.  Failures are handled the same way.

    1.  If the value returned is a wrapper, then it adds
        the new wrapper to the top of the stack and 
        starts to process it.

    2.  When Cooperate is returned from a generator, 
        it is sent all the way down the Wrapper linked
        list so that the reactor can re-schedule the
        processing chain (micro-thread).

So, I hope this helps.  Cooperate is the whole reason
for flow... without the need to 'pause' the whole stack
one wouldn't need the wrapper at all.

Actually, the diagram isn't quite right.  Here is a better one.

Suppose you have generator X -> Y -> Z, the picture 
then looks like...

     Wrap  <--  Z
         \ 
           \
             \

           \
             \
               v
     Wrap  <-- X
      |
      V
     Deferred
      |
      V
     reactor

Hello, Twisted people.

Out of the box (yet I already did `python setup.py install --prefix=/usr,

Should these be expected?  Reported?  This is over a SuSE 8.1 Linux.

Message-ID: <oqof2wx4u6.fsf@alcyon.progiciels-bpi.ca>

Hello, Twisted people.

In the manual found as `doc/howto/book.ps', some figures are inserted in
the text with a 90 degree rotation.  Despite this is not a great evil,
they would appear better if not rotated.  There is one on page 10 (1.1
High-Level Overview of Twisted); another on page 76 (4.6.2 Deferreds -
Visual Explanation); another on page 147 (6.3.3 The Diagram), and maybe
others, I did not try to be exhaustive here.

The figure on page 10 drops off the page, however, and this is more
serious, as one does not figure out how much of it is missing (I mean,
without looking at the HTML rendering of that section, which is OK).

All the source material for the Twisted PyCon papers and slides should
be in doc/historic/2003/pycon/.


Hey gang, what's the recommended procedure to make them pretty (i.e.
in-line the source examples, etc)?  Is that something that's supposed to
be part of the release process but we forgot to add to
admin/process-docs when we added these papers?  And if these papers are
really going to be static and unchanging, what do you think of
committing their rendered forms to the repository?

  Multicast is known to be broken in a few situations.  Can you describe
your network setup.  In particular, do you have a firewall configured, or is
the machine performing NAT?

Hmm, it means popen2 used french while reactor.spawnProcess used english.
That test clears the environment before running spawnProcess.. maybe we
should let it inherit the complete environment from its parent.

Could you try the attached patch and see if it fixes the problem?

I've seen that test fail on machines that don't have any external network
interfaces configured (just the loopback interface). My guess is that it has
to do with the 'MULTICAST' flag, which isn't usually set on lo.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted 1.0.4 - `mktap --help SERVER'
Message-ID: <oqk7dkx18v.fsf@alcyon.progiciels-bpi.ca>

Hi, still me.

After having quickly glanced over the manual, I'm reading it a bit more
carefully now, and if comments like this message continue to pop up, you
will observe my progression, or non-progression if I cannot find enough
time :-), without my real will.  Sigh!  OK, let not me be too shy...

Page 21 (2.2.3 mktap and tapconvert) says: "For a given server, `mktap
--help <name>' shows the possible configuration options.".  The following
shell script:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
#!/bin/bash
for s in coil conch dns ftp im inetd mail manhole news parent pinger ponger \
	 portforward procmon sibling socks telnet toc web words zoot; do
  echo $s =====================================
  mktap --help $s < /dev/null
done
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

seems to show that this is not completely true.

* For coil, dns, ftp, im, mail, pinger, ponger, portforward, socks, telnet,
  toc, web, words and zoot, I got no output at all, so I presume this
  may be interpreted as meaning that these servers use no option.  Yet,
  for all those, a `.tap' file was created, which is probably not what
  one expect from a mere `--help' option.  So maybe the `--help' did not
  work so well after all.

* I also got many DeprecationWarnings, which probably should not be there.
  Let's see:

  + conch yields:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->

----------------------------------------------------------------------<

  and for these three cases as well, a `.tap' file was created.  So maybe
  `--help' does not work as documented for these either.

* manhole did ask for supplementary information, like this:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Password: 
Confirm: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

  While sorting and cleaning out my various tries, I also found another
  case for `mktap --help manhole' which yielded the following:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
An error unexpected occurred:
  File "/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/tap/manhole.py", line 45, in opt_password
    self['password'] = util.getPassword(confirm=1)
  File "/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/python/util.py", line 154, in getPassword
    if password[-1] == '\n':
IndexError: string index out of range
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

  yet I do not find back the exact recipe I use for producing this.
  Maybe the traceback will give hints about another problem?  In any case,
  a `.tap' file was created.

* For inetd, I got:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
An error unexpected occurred:
  File "/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/runner/inetdconf.py", line 90, in parseLine
    self.parseFields(*line.split())
  File "/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/runner/inetdconf.py", line 174, in parseFields
    raise InvalidServicesConfError, 'Invalid port/protocol:' + \
InvalidServicesConfError: Invalid port/protocol:'3322-3325'
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

  At least, no `.tap' was created. :-)

* Both news and procmon provided the expected help output, and created no
  `.tap'.  However, the help was assorted with an error diagnostic,
  which is probably not appropriate for a mere help request.

  + news help output was prefixed with:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Usage Error: No newsgroups specified
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

  + procmon help output was suffixed with:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
Wrong number of arguments.
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

  Even if the errors were expected, they should _ideally_ be presented
  both before, or both after; and both have the `Usage Error:' prefix,
  or both not have it.

All in all, I'm left with the impression that `--help' does not work,
or at least, not as documented in the book.

It might be worth, maybe, adding another unit test which makes sure that
`mktap --help <name>' produces for all servers, some output (on standard
output ideally, not standard error), or no output at all, but surely no
traceback, and with an exit status that would be consistently zero.

  After looking at this for more minutes than it probably merited, I feel
that this usage should stay gone (rather than have mktap be fixed to
work as documented).

  It requires --help to be both a flag and a parameter, which usage does not
support directly.  It is also trivially achieved by reversing the order of
the arguments to be "mktap <name> --help".

  Any objections?  If not, I'll check in a doc fix tomorrow.

  Thank you for pointing this out.

  I agree.  There are effectively no unit tests for either mktap or twistd,
and the acceptance tests only test it in well-formed cases, which are nice,
but probably the least important ones to *test*, since that is how the
developers will all be invoked the tools (and so they will get plenty of
testing that way).

And / or, maybe, the overall testing environment (not the user) should
reset LANG, LANGUAGE, LC_LANG, LC_ALL and LC_MESSAGES before proceeding,
all to non set, or less ideally, set to empty, to `C' or to `POSIX'.

Wow!  All this from a mere "list index out of range"! :-)

There is indeed a firewall on the machine I use for testing Twisted, at
least on the network card facing the Internet, and masquereding is done
for internal machines forwarded from a second network card.  I would not
think beforehand that localhost as limitations against itself, however,
but am never fully sure, I do not often visit the firewall configuration.
I naively think that I can access localhost:ANYPORT without the firewall
being in the way.

I'm willing to revisit the firewall if you have a suggestion for me about
how to carefully open it, enough for Twisted to work reliably.

I surely could use, for testing Twisted, an internal machine which has
no intrinsic firewall, on some other internal network, but this might
not be where I want to run it in the long run.  Opinions?

Sadly, the new module lives only in my head at the moment.  I'd guess I'll
probably have it in CVS within a month.

Do you just want a simple FTP server that serves files from the filesystem?
If so, you may be able to use the existing code, but beware... it doesn't
have much access control beyond "authenticated" and "not authenticated",
which means that if you have anonymous access enabled, *anyone* use any FTP
command, including STOR, and so on.  If you want to use the existing code,
make sure to run it from a directory whose contents (including the directory
itself!) are read-only, even for the owner.  It *might* be safe to use then,
but I haven't rigorously checked that :)

What do you want to use an FTP server for?   :)

-Andrew.

The rotation is known bug.  Thanks for the reminder, though!

This works ok for me locally (using a copy of book.ps I built myself).  I
suspect the hack I use to make dia scale down the images when converting to
.eps is broken with some versions of dia.  I've been meaning to find a nicer
way to do this anyway...

Thanks for bug reports!

Thomas,

We should probably have those linked somewhere from
twistedmatrix.com.  Hopefully, that can be resolved soon.  Until then,
look in the doc/historic/2003/pycon directory for all of the papers
and most of the slides (I think).  This can be found in the 1.0.4
release or from Twisted CVS.

I was the one who gave the Twisted Web tutorial.  Unfortunately, I
didn't get a paper written.  I do, however, have slides.  They are
with the docs mentioned above or you can look at them at:

http://www.twistedmatrix.com/users/nafai/pycon-paper/

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  Sorry if the slides are
a little sparse.

I'm not using Twisted yet, but I expect to use it within a month or two. 
  I'll be porting an asyncore/chat based app developed using python 2.0. 
  I will definitely be adding some 2.2 features at the same time, so, in 
other words, no, I don't need 2.1 support :)

Not yet, but this application will see some serious usage starting in 
September.  It could potentially see peaks of 90k-200k clients 
connecting in a 24 hour span.  Hopefully I'll be able to report positive 
results to this list during load-tests.  Rewriting outside of 
python/twisted is obviously a no-go at this point, so if load testing 
comes up short we'll just throw more hardware at it!! :O

Side note: we're going to be using DNS round robin + Wackamole + Spread 
toolkit for server load balancing.  I haven't needed to use the python 
spread interface developed by Jeremy, Guido and Tim yet 
(http://www.python.org/other/spread/) but I'm wondering if anyone's 
tried to integrate that into Twisted?  I'd love for spread mailboxes to 
be processed through reactor like any other socket :)

no. But why don't wait somes month and switch directly to python2.3 ?

I did an online scrabble game. But i did'nt use a lot of feature of

You can use spawnProcess on windows by using the win32 reactor, see the
Choosing Reactors howto for instructions.

Well I don't think any of us have found that python 2.3 has significant 
new conveniences that can't be done adequately in 2.2 (i.e., it's 
possible to implement the itertools module in pure python, emulate the 
new dict creation behavior, etc.).  It seems to be mostly new modules, 
bugfixes, and performance enhancements.  Moving from 2.1 to 2.2 does 
have significant new features, though (mostly generators and new style 
classes).

Also, when 2.3 is released, hopefully in a few months, it'll probably 
take the better part of a year /after/ that for python 2.3 to come into 
common use (i.e. ISPs, linux distributions, etc.).

	This blocks right here; maybe it blocks in the ldap.initialize part, too.

	And it's error return mechanism seems to be by way of

I'm going to be hacking on DatabaseAuthorizer soon(er or later).

 * Is anybody using it? The current code is pretty crufty, so
   I'll probably just replace it once the hacking is done, unless
   it's actually being used.
 * Does anyone have a wishlist for it?

Right now I'm thinking of parameterizing what goes into the

perspective-class-specific state.

Python/GTK+ is only necessary for two arguably experimental portions of 
Twisted - im and manhole.  I think that it is acceptable to remove 
support in Debian woody for these, considering that more substantial, 
stable portions of Twisted (e.g. Conch, and twisted.web SSL) don't 
work, since they require libraries that are missing on woody.  Future 
GTK+ work is going to be using GTK2 anyway, considering that it is 
vastly more stable for the kinds of things we want to do, most of which 
involve displaying large, scrolling blocks of text.

PyQT is technically in Debian, but the version in Woody isn't very 
useful, and I haven't heard from anyone using it with Twisted.

There are no third-party programs that support Debian woody which 
require GTK to be working with Twisted.

As to other libraries - my primary concern was with database drivers 
which may have been incompatible with Python-2.2.  However, it appears 
that all DB-API compatible drivers that come with Woody have both 
python-2.1 and python-2.2 versions.

I've just spent the last few weeks working without the 2.1-support 
constraint, and I can see why all the Twisted developers have been 
clamoring for 2.2 :-).  While I have some concern that moving along 
with rearrangements of Python's basic semantics encourages the 
development of useless, whiz-bang infrastructure, the fact is that the 
new object model is substantially more amenable to necessary features 
like those implemented in twisted.python.components and 
twisted.python.reflect.

The results of this survey appear to indicate that most Twisted users 
are not using Python-2.1, and those that are plan to stop in the near 
future.  Also, as far as I can tell, nobody on the development team 
uses Python 2.1 any more, and so test failures related to 2.1 
incompatibilities are always caught after the fact.

I think it would improve our development speed and the general attitude 
of the team, so I propose we cut over to 2.2 immediately.  For the 
reasons I gave above, I don't think the GTK situation is important 
enough to prevent this.  If anyone else would like to give reasons for 
not going ahead with this, please speak now or forever hold your peace 
:)

(This does not mean "everybody check in 2.2-only code".  It means "get 
ready to check in 2.2-only code".  I will hopefully announce open 
season on 2.2 features later this week.)

I use 2.2 in my production environment.  However...

Python 2.1 was the "blessed" version of Python that Guido had
said would be supported for a _long_ time out (like 1.5 was).
It is also, as Moshe points out, the Debian standard and I know
many debian people who won't be upgrading.    This may play
a role in 'hosted environments' where people would like to 
deploy Twisted, but really can't reinstall Python. 

Also, with etrepum's recent patches to twisted.python.compat, 
much Twisted can still use the iterator protocol (compatible 
with 2.1).   Re-writing generators as 2.1 iterators is tedious,
but quite straight forward.

I can see some places where the use of generators is too much of
a goodness to pass up.   Why not mark those modules explicitly,
and make them 2.2 only?  For example, Woven could probably really
use 2.2 features.   In this way those users who insist on 2.1 can
use the bulk of (but perhaps not all of) Twisted, in such a way
that we don't compromise future development.

Also, someone posted that it didn't take too many changes to 
make Twisted 2.0 compatible.  Perhaps we should consider 
committing those changes.   Nested scopes are nice, especially
in application code, but they certainly arn't essential 
to library development.

Best,

Clark

'Twas I who said something like that, but I have to caution
that it was definitely not a case of making all of Twisted
run under 2.0.  All I did, as a spike, was to repeatedly run 
our little test program, which imported about three things from
twisted.internet, and patch -- in the most hideously ugly but
direct manner that I could -- anything which complained.  

I think there were about three complaints, two of which were
nested scope warnings.  To fix these, I simply removed the
"from __future__" statement and ran again.  I think the other
thing needed a stub/mock of some kind, with no functionality.
I supposed the code involved is either not being invoked (but
was giving syntax errors or warnings), or is managing to function 
normally or near normally in spite of being invoked without nested 
scopes working.  

There are probably a *lot* of latent problems, but for our purposes 
it seems to be adequate.  There's no way I'd translate this into 
a suggestion any of these changes should be checked in though! :-)

Template, widgets, woven or resource templates ), for implementing a form.

Someone has a link?

There will be a whole bunch of new, up-to-date docs on Woven in CVS within a
week.  I believe this includes a general tutorial and stuff about using
forms.

If you can, wait until we've got those docs ready.  Otherwise, you could try
asking for advice on #twisted on irc.freenode.net, which is currently the
best place for Woven docs (until the new docs get checked in...)

no. i wrote my own authorizer because DatabaseAuthorizer was not up to
the task.

put service and perspective names in database and allow for the client
to request for service/perspecitve in his keyring (derived from db).
that would be nice (and is what my authorizer does, btw.)

That was my thinking, too.  

Any chance you would be willing to share your authorizer?  
Some of us actually prefer not to reinvent wheels ... :^)

all my code (and i mean *all*, even the one i write for customers) is
available from cvs.initd.org under GPL. you may be interested in the
following files:

http://cvs.initd.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/wilma-prototype-2/server/wilmad
http://cvs.initd.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/wilma-prototype-2/wilma/server/auth.py
http://cvs.initd.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/wilma-prototype-2/wilma/server/service.py

they implement a db authorizer with just one service ("wilma") and some
perspectives, taken from the keyring (for example the "admin"
perspective is available only to people that have the "admin" role in
DB). i planned a better version (the code in wilma is very specific for
that project) but i have almost no time nowdays.. too much work.

also, for wilma we are moving to a much more fine-grained authorization
policy that does not involve perspectives, but that's completely OT
here.

one more: wabba is a generic "transaction manager" that takes a
completely different approach to dababase access than other
object-relational mappers (i talked about it with itamar on irc someweek
ago). it is still very alpha and we are reworking it a lot but there
will be an "official" release around june. it integrates well with
twisted.

hope this helps,
federico

Yes and yes. Don't hardcode table and fieldnames. 
Maybe you want to produce more detailed errors why the auth failed. I.e. when 
you have several services and a user isn't subscribed to one of them you'll 
get an "unknown user" error,  I think you should get a different error saying 
something about "service subscribtion" if the user is subscribed to other 
services on the same server.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, or out of date, but doesn't request.args
contain *lists* of things, always, and not the strings directly?  That
was what I observed on 1.0.3 anyway, I thought.

If that's so, then I think the above test will always pass, as 
request.args['text'] would contain [''] or [] or something, but
never just "".

That is correct. request.args always contains lists.

I have 2.2 everywhere I have twisted.  :)

I have twisted running with ldaptor on over 200 Solaris systems, pulling
configs out of LDAP for inetd/dnscache/tinydns/ldap.conf (pam/nss)/cron
and a few others things.  I do keep my own cvs of both twisted and ldaptor 
due to my need for having TLS built directly in <HINT>.  (yes I sent a patch).
They are highly out of date but work for me now.

Do you use jython with twisted? AFAIK no one does. And it's close to
being useless anyway.

Hopefully by the time 1.4 is widespread and we can write a decent nio
reactor (the current java reactor is more proof-of-concept than useful
implementation), Jython will support 2.2.

Currently you can't even run the test suite with Jython, to say nothing 
of the tests actually passing.  There would be a lot of work involved 
in getting Twisted to run on Jython-2.1 as-is, and 2.2isms are not a 
part of that.

At some point I'll try to get Jython's CVS running with current 
twisted.  Maybe we can encourage them to do a release if Twisted works 
on CVS and not on the released versions :)

No requirement for 2.1 at all - using 2.2 as normal (freebsd 4.8 comes with 
2.2.2 out of the box) in fact, looking forward to 2.3. Lots of goodies there. 
In fact I only have the 2.1 that comes with binary zope.

If we do decide to drop support for a widely-deployed version of Python,
it is my firm belief that we should make setup.py fail loudly when used
with those versions. If nothing else, it will make sure the Debian build
will never work until I actually remove the build of non-supported versions.
Which reminds me: please don't drop 2.1 support until sarge's freeze (not
release -- but post-freeze, I'll be assured of my new uploads not getting
into sarge, and I'd really like sarge's Twisted to support 2.1)

if there's a reason please enlighten me :)

That sounds like a good idea.

Why?  Doesn't sarge come with 2.2 as the default 'python', and pretty 
much every package compiled for it?

There's a valid alternative?

yes. default python for sarge is 2.2 (and there even was a discussion
about switching to 2.3 if a stable release happens before freeze [i
don't think it'll happen :)])

(the only reason for 2.1 in sarge is zope.)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] adapi.Connection._runQuery always does rollback()
Message-ID: <20030426135546.GA24250@localhost.localdomain>

RedHat 9.0 on intel
Twisted 1.0.4

In twisted.enterprise.adbapi we find this method of ConnectionPool:

    def _runQuery(self, args, kw):
        conn = self.connect()
        curs = conn.cursor()
        try:
            apply(curs.execute, args, kw)
            result = curs.fetchall()
            curs.close()
        finally:
            conn.rollback()
        return result

I do not understand the logic of always running a rollback even if the
query is successful.  I would, instead, expect this:

    def _runQuery(self, args, kw):
        conn = self.connect()
        curs = conn.cursor()
        try:
            apply(curs.execute, args, kw)
            result = curs.fetchall()
            curs.close()
        except:
            conn.rollback()
	    raise
        return result

And, indeed, this is _exactly_ what we see in adbapi._runOperation,
which is the method following _runQuery.

-Eric

PS. This buglet brought to you by MySQL which does not support rollback(), 
    and tells you with an exception.

The theory here, I believe is that queries are meant to have no side-effects
on the DB, so the rollback is done to guarantee this.  If you *do* want to
change the state of the DB, use runOperation.

Then the database module you are using doesn't adhere to DB-API 2.0[1], which
adbapi requires.

Sure, that's a theory.  And, yay, verily, MySQL isn't known for it's
strict adherance to standards.  However:

   http://www.python.org/topics/database/DatabaseAPI-2.0.html#connection

Says

 rollback()
    This method is optional since not all databases provide 
    transaction support.[3]

And footnote 3 sayeth:

    3 If the database does not support the functionality required by
    the method, the interface should throw an exception in case the
    method is used.

    The preferred approach is to not implement the method and thus
    have Python generate an AttributeError in case the method is
    requested. This allows the programmer to check for database
    capabilities using the standard hasattr() function.

    For some dynamically configured interfaces it may not be
    appropriate to require dynamically making the method
    available. These interfaces should then raise a NotSupportedError
    to indicate the non-ability to perform the roll back when the
    method is invoked.

Further, a rollback trashes a whole transaction.  The query could be
part of a larger transaction which includes update operations.
Granted, this is just silly in the async thread-pool, but that's why I
found it rather surprising.

For long running transactions you want to do the runTransaction or
whatever it's called method - the one where you pass a callable and it
gets run with a adbapi.Transaction object in a thread, thus allowing you
to do a series of database queries one after the other in a natural,
blocking way.

But, looks like we do need to deal with broken rollback support in
mysql. Is there any flag we can check, or must we trap AttributeError
and whatever mysql throws on rollback() calls?

One of the ACID properties is to provide for a consistent read,

between the two reads, the 2nd query sees things without the change.
If you don't rollback, then the 'read transaction' will still 
reflect results at the time the first query was executed.

Therefore, a rollback is needed so that subsequent queries
reflect new changes to the database and is not 'stale'.

This is an arguable point..

Consider, from a security standpoint, that an attacker is trying to
brute-force your server.  'service subscription' error says 'you have
correctly guessed a username, but are attempting to access the wrong
service'.  Having a valid username is much closer to a username/password
pair than not having a valid username.. ;p

Perhaps it should be configurable to behave both ways.

What type of database are you accessing?  Would transactions be
helpful?  MySQL has transaction-safe tables, you simply have to be
explicit when creating them (and all of your tables must be transaction
safe to avoid 'partial' rollbacks..).

What Conch does for this is takes whatever error 
the authentication raises, whether it be invalid 
user, invalid password, etc., and turns it into a 
generic 'not authenticated' message.  If you want 
to keep attackers from knowing which names are 
actual users, you probably just want to do that, 
rather than having a flag in the Authorizer.

Not at this time.

MySQL is very fast and very lightweight.  It also runs on platforms
like Win9X (the pain, the pain!).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Trial Refactoring
Message-ID: <20030426172323.GA620@sting>

I've made some pretty significant changes to trial tonight [1][2]. They 
have been mainly focussed on refactoring to reduce repeated code, and 
on being able to extend trial.

The tests work for me [3]. If they don't work for you, this is probably 
the reason. Please check for your platform as soon as possible and let 
the list know.

I have tried hard to keep the functionality as close to the original as 
possible, but there have been some changes.

Feel free to gaffle me and rollback the commit if this is a disastrous 
mistake.

cheers,
jml

your adapter is b0rked. as per dbapi-2.0 document:

            Database modules that do not support transactions should
            implement this method with void functionality.

Alrighty.  In case anyone else needs to do this before the MySQL
Python API is brought up-to-date, here's how I kludged it without
changing twisted:

    import MySQLdb

    def doNothing(*args, **kw):
       return None

    class AddRollback:
       def __init__(self, module):
	  self.doConnect = module.connect

       def connect(self, *args, **kw):
	  result = self.doConnect(*args, **kw)
	  result.rollback = doNothing
	  return result

    MySQLdb.connect = AddRollback(MySQLdb).connect

hi!

you did this in your 'application' code? (you know that this will block
your whole twisted app for the time of the query right? since MySQLdb is
not async .. and u'd need a thread to make it kinda async ..)

I meant to, but I guess I never did -- I'll do that now.

To summarize the discussion, you need to commit, not rollback,
as it's possible for select calls to have side effects. One example
is calling a stored procedure.

This makes sense.  For example, the stored procedure may update
an access log table which records the last time that a user looked
at a given peice of information.   This could be quite useful.

But, in any case, the 'transaction' should be terminated.  If it
was successful (no exception) then it should be committed, else
it should be rolled back...

yes, there is not that much difference between a Query and an Operation.
imho the adbapi can be cleaned up *a lot*, but i'll try that after
sending my big cleanup patch (that makes min/max of connections
working). i just need to find enough time to write a test case to
demonstrate it does not break anything.

Thanks. I know that the MySQLdb API blocks.

You will note that I'm not actually using the MySQLdb API in the code
below, but adding code which adds a rollback method to allocated
connection objects.  Long-running calls go through the
twisted.enterprise APIs.

to be honest - nothing - I have my own version based .10 and patches
hand applied as needed up to version .13.  With it being deployed on as
many systems we do the process of upgrading is not something we do
often.

I have not come across anything I was not able to do with ldaptor.  I
dont push it to hard, just a lot of searches and maybe a password change or
two. 

I don't really like the DNS SRV records and that way of connecting.  So 
I just don't use it.  

We have added TLS support to ldaptor to go along with the TLS patch I 
wrote for twisted.  I am not able to release that patch due to it was 
created by working with another employee.

One thing I would kill to have is the server side of things in twisted.
This would allow me to build the ldap caching daemon / proxy daemon. nscd
on Solaris is a pile of junk, but an absolute need for nsswitch with ldap.  
And just be damn fun to play with.  But I will be damned if I know anyone 
that wants to write it. 

Thank you once again for creating ldaptor, it has save this sysadmin
untold hours of config changes and has been fun to play with.

Message-ID: <oqel3oc7gx.fsf@alcyon.progiciels-bpi.ca>

Hi, people.

I noticed yesterday how heavily Twisted tries to find `plugins.tml'.  Being
new to the game, and not knowing the motivations, a lot of things surely
escape my comprehension, yet at first glance, it looks excessive to me
trying many thousands of disk accesses merely to find a configuration file.

Instead of a long listing followed by a discussion about what could be
spared (like, for example, looking all over in `/usr/bin'), this simple
experiment shows the problem -- if you agree that there is a problem! :-)

That doesn't really make any sense.  Does your employer have some 
ridiculous "we own you" IP contract?

Yes - I have permission (in writing for what i do at home is mine) but
other employees do not (or have not even asked).  And all work done at 
the office is owned wholly by my employer.  There is really nothing 
I can do, I have ask permission to release it back to everyone and was 
denied.  The TLS patch i sent was created at home just for this reason.

I plan on using Twisted for at least a couple of new (from-scratch) 
projects, and they will all be using Python 2.2.2 or newer.

Not yet, but if everything goes according to current plan I should have 
something interesting to share in 6-9 months. ;)

Wow, your job sucks :)  I used to have one of those a few years ago.  I

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted 1.0.4 - Tildes in the book
Message-ID: <oq4r4jdiko.fsf@alcyon.progiciels-bpi.ca>

Hi, still me...

In the Twisted 1.0.4 book -- I hope this reference is unambiguous enough,
I have not seen more than one :-) -- there is a problem here and there with
`~' being shown over the next character (`/' for example) instead of prior
to it as intented.  At many places, tildes are OK, however.  Should I try
reporting all problematic cases?  I guess not, as the problem is likely
to be the same at all places, and some global action could be taken.
The example I'm currently looking at is at the end of page 136 (6. Web
Applications; 6.1.2 Before we begin) on this quote:

   Make sure the `TwistedQuotes' directory is on your PYTYONPATH, put
   `webquotes.rpy' and `WebQuotes.html' in your `~/public_html' directory,
   and you are ready to go.

The `~' and `/' on the last sentence are at the same character position.

I got the same problem, then quickly figured out that I forgot to create
an empty `__init.py__' file within the other files.

But the real reason of this reply is for reporting that the documented:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
   Saving qotd application to qotd.tap...
   Saved.
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

lines are not given in response to calling `mktap'.  Besides that detail,
the example nicely works.  Instead of amending the documentation to
remove those two lines, maybe `mktap' could accept some `-v' option,
server generic, for producing them, and be an opened door for any later
other useful extra feedback?

The thing is, it's not a configuration file :-) It's a plugins file. The point
is for applications to distribute one along with their packages, and just have
it put into their Python package directory, so there's no tricky registration
process required.

Ok.  It is not a configuration file, if you want.  Or this file configures
the plugins, say.  And, I surely understood that the idea of searching so
hard was so the user does not have to say much about where it is.  Granted.

It still looks like Twisted is going overboard with this.  If `plugins.tml'
files were being collected from the top-level directories along `sys.path'
and maybe no more than one-level below, and maybe also for test purposes
(despite the security weakness), into the current directory and one
level of directories below, it would probably make a lot of sense at a
reasonable cost.

But trying every single executable along the shell load path as if the
executable were a directory (yet I understand it would be slower to first
check if it is a directory) is heavy and unlikely to be any fruitful -- at
least in my naive eyes.  It might be worth some revisiting, who knows...
If you really want full generality, it might be more sane and useful to
invent some TWISTED_SEARCH_PATH environment variable, than to go berzerk
and frantically search everything in the wild. :-)

That's exactly what it's documented to do. If it's not doing that, it's a bug.
(btw, the current directory gets no special treatment. If it's searching
the current directory, it's because the current directory is somehow in 
sys.path)

It's not using the shell load path. /usr/bin just happens to be in your
sys.path. And, I'm guessing that explicitly checking 1) whether or not
each item is a directory and 2) whether or not that directory has an 
__init__.py is, as you said, more expensive (and checking for __init__.py
is actually trickier than it seems at first, because you also need to
check for .pyc, .pyo, .pyd, .so....).

And inventing a new environment variable is contrary to the stated goal,
which is the lack of a registration process (apart from what you need to do
to have your package work with Python).

Now, are you actually having a *problem* with the performance of mktap?

Sorry, I misread your paragraph. It's not quite exactly doing that - it's
searching in one *less* place than what you said (directories along sys.path;
it *only* searches one level of subdirectories along each directory in sys.path)

Attached is a patch to twisted.enterprise.row, the sqlreflector, and 
util.py to allow mixed-case table/row names (and to double-quote them in 
databases that require it, such as postgres).

I sent this a while back with a detailed explanation, but have now 
developed some docs on the web at http://gnubia.net/Docs/Twisted.Gnubia/ 
detailing some of my changes..

Oh yeh and.. erm.. Itamar told me to re-send on irc a few min ago..

This stuff may need to be cleaned up, and I've considered separating 
some of it out into a PGRow or somesuch, the way that I (and someone 
else on the list) am using a PGSQLReflector to do some postgres-specific 
stuff.

suggestions / criticism / flames welcome

Fixed in CVS. For spelling errors, mentioning it on IRC (#twisted

2.1 support is now officially dead.

Please don't start changing existing Twisted code to use 2.2 features
unless you're actually adding new functionality. We might need to
backport some code to 2.1 at some point, though that's pretty unlikely.

My feeling is that we should wonder nevertheless.  Consider that, in
actual practice, 1.0.4 was issued with DeprecationWarnings still remaining
for a few servers (conch, parent, sibling), that another server without
arguments raises an exception (inetd).  So we can doubt there was so plenty
of testing, and a unit test for those would add more security to releases.

Because I know :-) The default sys.path isn't there, but your `mktap'
is located in /usr/bin, isn't it? :-)

You probably thought I was being over-assertive because I wasn't explaining
myself fully. I apologize for that. But I did the research, and found out
why this was happening. (more below)

The "Writing Twisted Plugins" section, IIRC.

Trolls like this aren't necessary. If you have a suggestion for improvement
(a special-case for leaving out /usr/bin despite its being in the python
path, for example), then I'll gladly hear it out. But I'm fairly certain
that there's no debate on what the *current* behavior is.

As I stated above, /usr/bin is in your sys.path because that's probably where
your `mktap' is located. If you don't believe me, modify your local Twisted
installation to add a `print sys.path' to twisted.scripts.mktap.

Yeah, I examined the output of that strace that you quoted in your original
mail; I discovered, as I had expected, that /usr/bin was in my python path
because that's where `mktap' is located.

Thanks.  Following your suggestion, I re-installed Twisted 1.0.4 with
the above patches, and reran `admin/runtests'.  The patches apparently
solved a few things.  Without them, the testing summary was:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
FAILED (failures=2, errors=1, skips=3, expectedFailures=2)
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

and now, it is reduced to:

Stated where?  The book does not clearly indicate (or I did not read that
part yet) where `.tml' files are exactly looked for.

I'm surely a patient man.  Yet, `mktap' could be faster, and nobody
would complain.

And besides and moreover, I may well report a bug, without having an actual
problem with it.  Having to much insist that a bug exists remembers me
the old times of contacting vendors of non-free software.  This is the
second time in the Python community that I observe this phenomenon.
Being receptive to feedback is a good way to keep it coming, you know.

OK then.  I am now reporting a bug.  The default Python path for this
Python 2.2.1, which I installed over a SuSE 8.0 Linux distribution, is:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
>>> sys.path
['',
 '/usr/lib/python2.2',
 '/usr/lib/python2.2/plat-linux2',
 '/usr/lib/python2.2/lib-tk',
 '/usr/lib/python2.2/lib-dynload',
 '/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages',
 '/usr/lib/python2.2/site-packages/PIL',
 '/sram/griffon/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages']
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

The last line comes from a local `sitecustomize.py'.  The current directory
while testing is:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
~/sram/twisted/web
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

Doing `strace mktap', and cleaning out from the result what is expected
from the current value of `sys.path' (yet without checking if the depth
of search is reasonable), leaves these to consider, explain and justify:

This is a subtle issue... right now we're going to fix it by 
hard-coding /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin as paths that should not be 
checked, but the real problem is an interaction between Python's 
default path behavior, UNIX's filesystem layout, and the way 
twisted.python.plugins works.

Itamar and I had a few ideas for fixing it "for real" but the caveats 
that we would have to put in the documentation are so ugly that we 
discarded them.  Hard coding '/usr/bin' should fix most cases.

While we were in there, we also removed all paths with a '.' in them: 
since these can't be valid Python packages anyway, it doesn't affect 
its correctness, and it has the benefit of making mktap at least 30% 
faster, even without filtering /usr/bin.

Thanks for bringing 'strace mktap' to our attention.  I'm sure 
everybody will appreciate mktap being much less sluggish :).

It is.  Twisted was installed using `root', and with --prefix=/usr.

I have "3.3 - Writing a New Plug-In for Twisted", and I presume this is what
you are referring to.  I read that section many times, and once more before
sending the above question, and once more now.
The documentation says that:

   Twisted finds its plug-ins by using pre-existing Python concepts;
   the load path, and packages.  Every top-level Python package[4]
   [...] can potentailly contain some number of plug-ins.  [...] The only
   difference between a package and a drop-in is the existence of a file
   named `plugins.tml' [...] that contains some special Python expression
   to identify the location of sub-packages or modules which can be loaded.

This is the most precise description I could find.  Maybe there is a
linguistic barrier (I'm not an English speaker), but to me, this is a
bit generic.  It is not said that plug-ins _are_ `plugins.tml' files, nor
that those TML files are necessarily at the same place the plug-ins are,
(like next to `__init__.py', say), only their existence is asserted.

It is not so clearly stated either that this is a goal that TML files shall
never be themselves registered.  Maybe you could use my naive reading
as a hint that the documentation could be more precise on these points,
as other readers might have the same interpretation difficulties than me.

Hopefully, you'll come to know be better, and discover that I never troll.
I am a peaceful and joyful man, and try to speak in all honesty, always.
Oh, I may tease in a friendly way, but then, there are smileys not far.

> If you have a suggestion for improvement [...] then I'll gladly hear

For now, being a Twisted newcomer that knows very little about it, my
contributions may be timid for a good while.  I'm just sharing the mere
existence of problems I see with my naive eyes, despite I know that in
the area of free software, patches and precise suggestions are usually
quite welcome.  I hope acquiring a bit of competence, and become a better
contributor with the time passing.  Let me apologise for all the false
notes I may sing in the meantime.

I'm quite willing to believe you, you know! :-)

Is Twisted modifying `sys.path' to include the first part of argv[0]?
Or is it standard Python behaviour?  I never noticed this yet in my own
scripts, but it might just have escaped my attention, and I might not know.

Yeah, it's a common misconception about Python, actually. Yes, Python always
adds the location of the main script to sys.path (the misconception is that
people think it's "the current directory" rather than "the location of the main
script", because people so often run their main scripts from the directory
that they're located in.

This is already fixed in CVS :)

You will find ^ also has the same problem -- and it is also fixed in CVS :)

Thanks for enlightening me.

For the case of the heaviness for `plugins.tml', at least on Unix, there
might be something we could do that would be reasonable on average,
but I'm not fully sure, I'll merely let judge those who are grown up! :-)

Usually, `/usr/bin/' and such do not have subdirectories, so if a
directory contains 1000 entries, one may immediately check if one of
these is `plugins.tml' by a direct try.  Then, if the number of links of
that directory -- itself -- is exactly 2, we can conclude that it has no
sub-directories, and that there is nothing more to check for this one.
We could then get more speed even for directories other than `/usr/bin/'.

This trick is heavily used in GNU find as a way to avoid `stat'ing all
entries in a directory to find sub-directories, when it can be proven
in advance there is no such sub-directories.  When the trick was added,
the speed-up that resulted was judged spectacular.

But I do not remember if Linux existed at the time.  As Linux seems to
beat many other systems at properly caching disk accesses, the benefits
of the trick might be more hidden.  A year ago, maybe, I tried the same
trick on Linux in hope of increasing the performance of `os.path.walk',
and the speed-up was not so significant.  This is part of my hesitation.

Moreover, maybe the above trick is meaningless on Windows or on MacOS.
I would be surprised if there are Unix filesystems where the link count of
2 for directories (`/' excepted) is not dependable; this might be another
thing to check.  With some luck, GNU find sources would tell us what the
problems may be.  The maintainers surely met them all! :-)

my system is 
window me
python 2.2.2
twisted 1.0.4
php 4.3.1
mysql
phpbb 2.0.4

i want to run phpbb on twisted 1.0.4 under window,
when i installed above software on window xp home edition,it was successful.
but when i installed above software on window me or window xp profession edition,it failed.

Step of my doing is 
1)create dir c:\pydoc and copy c:\python22\doc to c:\pydoc 
  create c:\pydoc\phpbb2 and copy phpbb2 to it

2)edit hello.rpy in c:\python22\scripts and save it in this dir
from twisted.web import static, twcgi

class PHPScript(twcgi.FilteredScript):
    filter = 'C:\\PHP\\php'

resource = static.File("c:\\pydoc")

resource.processors[".php"] = PHPScript

resource.indexNames = ['index.html','index.php']

3)run the command:
  python mktap.py web -p 80 --resource-script=hello.rpy -i index.html,index.php

4)run the command:
  python twistd.py -f web.tap -r win32

After the fourth step ran,i entered into the ie browser and input
http://localhost/   it is ok to show the html.
but while i input http://localhost/phpbb2 ,
it show 500 error. 

why? who can help me to solve it?

Of course, mktap also adds "the current directory" (".") to sys.path.

  If your "twistd" is in /usr/bin, then the '' at the beginning of sys.path
refers to /usr/bin.  It is not at all clear to me that it would be correct
to remove '' from the .tml search path.  It would result in greatly enhanced
mktap performance, but it could also lead to confusing behavior (and the
behavior of .tml searching is more than confusing enough already).

  I certainly wouldn't ;)

  What twisted/python/plugins.py does is not particularly difficult.  Python
makes it difficult to do efficiently (perhaps because it is difficult to do
efficiently in a platform independant way).  If someone with more POSIX-foo
than I could take a good look at what it does, and see if there really is a
portable way we could implement parts of it in C (and maybe get those bits
added to Python itself), that'd be fantastic.

  Thanks again for the bug reports.  Please, keep them coming :)

  I think it was fast enough before ;)  And my computer is *slow*.  But it

Message-ID: <200304281219.52777.arashi1@pd.jaring.my>

Hello all,

I'm doing some RnD for eventual migration to a twisted system. I'm not sure 
how 'production' the various bits of twisted are and I'm also not sure how 
all the bits would fit together. 

I'm thinking I'll need:
twisted.web (need to do virtual hosts on with this)
twisted.mail
twisted.names(?)

I think the setup I'm planning is quite common on the net but most people use 
apache and sendmail and something called virtualhostmonster?

Users should not need a unix account - for email, I'm thinking of using a db 
to store their username and passwords and get twisted.mail to check there 
when they try to authenticate to download their emails. Incidentally, would 
mbox or a dbms be better here?

Of course, each website of these users would be on the same machine with the 
same ip. They would have different domains though - with the content of their 
websites stored in (maybe) an rdbms. So:

Bob's homepage would be at:
http://www.bobshome.com

and his email would be: bob at bobshome.net

I would greatly appreciate pointers/tips to achieve this.

	Maildir is better than mbox is better than dbms.

	The important thing is to make that optimization disabled if

	A Linux box with enough memory should have really good stat
	performance with a hot cache. For /usr/bin, it may be that
	the cache is mostly hot anyway. But even Linux will suffer
	the same performance problems with a cold cache or too little

but since i enter into the internet on a computer through gateway,
speed of visiting the computer with web server of twisted 1.0.4 in intranet is quick.

If I remember well, GNU `find' keeps the link count for a given directory.
Every time it stats an entry which is a sub-directory, it decreases the
link count.  When the link count reaches 2, the loop is exited (provided
`stat' calls are only needed for directory recursion -- `find' sometimes
need them for other purposes).

One may consider that Twisted may also be used on lesser Unices than
Linux -- I'm not going to name any! :-) -- where the performance hit might
hurt more.  As a good rule, I think one should not overly rely on various
systems' disk cache, and be on the parsimonious side while accessing disks.

Thanks!  In fact, I remembered that I've seen the problem with `^', but

Possibly lack of reverse DNS on your local network, depending on what
twisted is doing - I could be speaking from my orifice. (If it's trying to
do a reverse lookup, it's timing out in the process, thus appearing to be
slow.)

(If this *is* happening, why is twisted doing the lookup by default?)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Resource.render() returning NOT_DONE_YET
Message-ID: <20030428160935.GA68316@doublegemini.com>

I was just giving a quick Twisted tutorial to someone using
twisted and as we were breaking page construction into more
than one chunk... an unexpected stumbling block occurred --
returning NOT_DONE_YET form the resource's render() function.

I was thinking about two other options:

  1.  Perhaps NOT_DONE_YET could just be None, this 
      way, it can be the default return value.  As I'm
      browsing through my code this is the most common
      return... why not make it the default.

  2.  Alternatively, allow a Deferred to be a return 
      value.  Then the underlying caller can add 
      result.finish() to the deferred chain.   This
      has the advantage of not requiring finish() to
      really be managed.   Either the return value is
      a string, a Deferred, (or for backwards compatibiliy
      NOT_DONE_YET).  In either of the primary cases,
      result.finish() always gets called... thus making
      it easier on newbies.

Ideally, both of the above options could be used...

Best,

Clark

Or, you could just deprecate NOT_DONE_YET and say "if you're doing 
something that uses req.write you need to return a deferred".

For case 1, you return a deferred with an empty rval (None or '').  
This signifies that you took care of req.write.
For case 2, you return a deferred with the page as the rval.  This 
signifies that you want the server to req.write.

I think that's the simplest way, and takes the return values for render 
down to three, but really two for new code:
1) a string
2) a deferred
3) a deprecated NOT_DONE_YET

There are problems with using Twisted/PHP right now. PHP won't work unless you've
compiled it with some special flags for "CGI Support", at least as of one of the
recent PHP versions.

I'm not even sure if PHP support should remain in. Nobody's maintaining it (not
to mention that it's hard to support, apparently), and there are much better
solutions for serving PHP than what Twisted can offer.

> I understand it makes use of the apache module "mod_rewrite"...

I don't know what you're talking about wrt mod_rewrite,  but if you've already
got Apache, you should definitely be using Apache's PHP support with mod_php.

The reasoning behind not allowing None as a default value is that 
forgetting is too easy.  If you're writing a simple request that has a 
render() method that looks like

     def render(self, request):
         if self.authenticated:
             return self.goodies

the default behavior should not be "hang forever".

What if you wanted to start writing the page in the render() method but 
keep writing it later?  Then we have None as a synonym for NOT_DONE_YET 
except in certain situations where you've done something to the request?

I've discussed this with several different people at various times... 
the trouble is, there isn't really a use-case that Deferreds make 
easier.  render() ends up being a relatively low-level interface, and 
the NOT_DONE_YET/write/finish API is quite convenient for the stuff 
that has been implemented with it.

I am definitely a True Believer in the Deferred, but in this case it 
just doesn't seem worth the inconvenience of deprecating things and 
shuffling stuff around for a vanishingly small benefit.

While there is good motivation for not making this public info, it seems 
like it would be a good thing to make this available to someone 
debugging the system, either by way of the log file or some other means.

While not necessarily appropriate for Twisted, one approach that I've 
used well in the past (in my own webserver and web app software) was to 
have an error page that recognized authenticated users and would display 
generic errors to unknown or unauthorized users, and 
informative/descriptive errors to authorized people (as well as direct 
access to the web-based tools used to determine what went wrong and so on).

Maybe some sort of policy framework might let that happen within Twisted 
or some other generalized logging infrastructure.  But at the least, it 
seems like this sort of info should be logged.

Cheers,

  - Bruce

Hi,

I am trying to create an XMLRPC server based on the plugins example in the
HOWTO documentation.  My TAP construction module looks like:

    from twisted.web import server
    from MyXMLRPCServer import methods

    from twisted.python import usage

    class Options(usage.Options):
        optParameters = [["port", "p", 8080, "Port number for XMLRPC Server."],
                         ["ldapurl", None, "ldap://localhost/", "URL for ldap directory server."],
                         ["ldapbinddn", None, "cn=Manager,dc=iu,dc=edu", "Bind DN for directory"],
                         ["ldappw", None, None, "Password for directory Bind DN"]]

        def postOptions(self):
            if self['ldappw'] is None:
                raise usage.UsageError, "Must provide option ldappw"

    def updateApplication(app, config):
        port = int(config['port'])
        factory = server.Site(methods.MyXMLRPCMethods(config))
	 app.listenTCP(port, factory)


 When I run mktap with the appropriate parameters for my application, I get:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/local/bin/mktap", line 30, in ?
        run()
      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/scripts/mktap.py", line 252, in run
        a.save()
      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/internet/app.py", line 754, in save
        dumpFunc(self, f)
      File "/usr/local/lib/python2.2/site-packages/twisted/internet/app.py", line 736, in dumpFunc
        _dump(obj, file, 1)
    cPickle.UnpickleableError: Cannot pickle <type 'LDAP'> objects

I think I am getting this because my "MyXMLRPCMethods" instance contains a
connection to the LDAP Server.  So what is the best approach to work
around this.  Sorry if this is a newbie question; I am a newbie.

  Don't connect to the LDAP server until your application starts up.  This
may be best done in a Factory's startFactory() method or a Service's
startService method, or hackfully in one of your object's __setstate__
methods.

  mktap is writing a configuration file to disk, not actually running your
app.  So you don't want to set up any runtime stuff, like network
connections, in updateApplication().

Completely agree. Related to this issue, i feel, is what should be best 
practices
for a twisted web application? With all that's available, and little 
imagination,
one can very easily get all tangled up in blue ;)

In view of a site that I have the intention to build, I have been 
trying to select
what best implementation architecture to adopt, looking always for the 
most
stupidly simple. I also want to be able to handle errors as nicely as 
possible
for the users -- meaning I would like to, _whenever_ possible, return a
fully consistent page (and hopefully the one expected by the user) that
provides also the error info, but that would not require the user to do 
anything
more than correct form input data on the _same_ page (without even 
hitting Back
on the browser). I hate the feeling of being surprised with drastic 
error pages,
with all my input data apparently disappeared (also dislike pop-ups 
asking to
repost data, ...). Of course these errors will be of the type 'Ah, that 
one exists
already please try another'... This is all somewhat application 
specific, and
about interfaces, but i feel implementation style can both help or 
hinder this.

A further issue that i find very nagging (at least during development), 
is that
if an error occurs within the presentation layer, the response hangs 
forever.
(These should of course be only development bugs, but i would not like 
to
deliver an app that *may* have presentation bugs yet unknown.) I 
therefore
wrap the call to the real presentation handler in a try/catch. Errors 
in the
business logic are raised to the error handler, so this is not a 
problem. Since I
want my errors to be rendered with a fully functional response, the 
error callback
simply sets the additional response data object, and passes to the
presentation layer (this assumes that the business layer has behaved 
nicely
and attached to request the necessary and sufficient data objects, so 
that
the presentation can render it into a coherent page).

  I am going for this anatomy:


class WebAppPage(twisted.web.resource.Resource):

     def render(self, request):
         request.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8')
         ...
         d = threads.deferToThread(self.businessLogic, request) # to be 
threadpooled ;)
         d.addCallback(self.presentationLogic, request)
         d.addErrback(self.errBack, request)
         return NOT_DONE_YET

   def businessLogic(self, request):
       # uses functionality that is neatly factored in external modules 
;)
       # and attaches the resulting data objects to request in a 
designated
       # container, separate from args (e.g. respargs).
       # Knows no HTML, never calls request.write()

  def presentationLogic(self, result, request, error=None):
     try:
         self._presentationLogic(result, request, error)
     except:
         import sys
         request.write( '''Ooops, error in presentation layer:<p>%s: 
%s</p>'''
                         % ( sys.exc_info()[0], ' -- 
'.join(sys.exc_info()[1].args) ))

   def _presentationLogic(self, result, request, error=None):
       # combines the data objects in args, and result (if any - thus 
may be None)
       # with rendering templates, html, js, css, ...

def errBack(self, error, request):
     self.presentationLogic([],request,error=error)


This suggests that my site's rpy resources should inherit from a 
subclass of resource,
to at least define a common error callback and presentation try/catch 
wrap for the whole
site. However, a small thing escapes me -- how do i guarantee specific 
and automatic
treatment to the request object for all my resources? E.g. setting 
specific headers,
reading cookies/session info, etc., without coding this in every rpy 
instance?

The error handling inherent with Deferred makes it worth it IMHO.  I 
see a lot of NOT_DONE_YET responses fail and it just hangs for the web 
user unless the developer of the function did a lot more work.. a 
deferred could just errback on a failure rather than having to summon 
the web traceback mechanism manually.

I've had two use cases for NOT_DONE_YET they are:

   1.  You've already use req.write() several times followed
       by req.finish()... and then return NOT_DONE_YET.   This is
       confusing usage, primarly beacuse you *are* done.   This
       usage is supported by option #4 above.

   2.  You've setup a async call to finish handling the request,
       and in this case, it makes sence to return Deferred.  In
       this case returning NOT_DONE_YET, and having to call 
       req.finish() is just extra, unnecessary baggage; further,
       default error handling isn't provided when it should be.

NOT_DONE_YET is less than optimal in both use cases where it is used,
both of these cases confused a newbie that I was trying to teach.

Best,

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Reloading of the same `.rpy' file
Message-ID: <oqk7ddz7pt.fsf@titan.progiciels-bpi.ca>

Hi, Twisted people.

Playing with resource files, I noticed that the outer-level code within
`.rpy' files is executed again every time the page using them is fetched by
the browser.  If `test.py' contains:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
print "Hello!"

...
resource = ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

than each `Alt-R' within Netscape, once `http://localhost:8080/test.rpy' has
been loaded, will have "Hello!" added to the Twisted log file.

I would have expected the resource file to be loaded once, and reused after
without being wholly re-initialised each time.  I tried "import remanent"
within the resource file, and checked that "remanent" is loaded and
intialised only once (moreover, it gets compiled!), so I'm tempted to move
all code from `test.rpy' into `remanent.py' and reduce `test.rpy' to a mere:

---------------------------------------------------------------------->
import remanent
resource = remanent.resource
----------------------------------------------------------------------<

which is a bit ridiculous if it has to be a standard idiom.

On the other hand, for debugging, I agree it is a bit handsome being able to
modify `test.rpy' and trying the new version without restarting the server.
This is a weak justification however.  Whenever the `.tap' file needs to be
rebuilt, the server needs to be restarted anyway.  This soon warrants a
Makefile, and adding another dependency over `test.rpy' is a simple matter.

Maybe the Twisted design is trying, here, to spare memory by not keeping
`.rpy' code in its memory, in case these would be very numerous or contain a
lot of code?  Or trying to protect itself against leaks from such, but how?
I have the vague feeling that I'm missing something important in this area.
Would some soul be kind enough to accept enlightening mine? :-)

I think Zope has the same behaviour. The solution is often to put a
reverse proxy before twisted.web.

Yes, there surely is a lot of substance in that single chapter.  It cannot

Thanks for the pointer, yet I'm not ready to understand it yet.  It seems I
should know `Componentized' first.  Later, hopefully.  I wonder what is the
extent and scope of a `registry'.  Exactly one per `.rpy' file presumably?

Does this explain why, or why not, `.rpy' files are reloaded many times?

I'm at lost here.  What is a reverse proxy in the context of Twisted?
(Could you give me some pointers?)  And how does a reverse proxy (whatever
it is) change the reloading behaviour of Twisted for `.rpy' files?

It doesn't affect .rpy's in any way whatsoever. 

RPYs are designed to be reloaded every time. If you don't want this
behaviour, don't use RPYs - rather, create your Resource tree in memory,
rather than out of the filesystem.

Thanks a lot, William.

Your example (quoted in full below, for reference) has been both useful and

It does not seem to be called ever, when I run your example.

Hello, Itamar.  Thanks for replying.

I'm not trying to challenge the design, I'm much too new to Twisted. :-) I'm
just not understanding it.  What are the reasons for reloading `.rpy' files
every time?  There ought to be some advantages, but I'm not seeing them.

No, it merely talks about how to persistize objects...such as your resource.

Why is it ridiculous? The semantics for .rpy are good because they're flexible;
you can either recreate your Resource object every time, or you can cache it.

Also, mind that .rpys are meant to be as tiny as possible; they're just
supposed to be glue code between your web app code and the web server.

Nope, just trying to remain flexible. It gives you a choice between CPU usage
(recreating your Resource every time) and memory usage (keeping your Resources
around in memory between requests).

Also, IIRC there's some sort of caching mechanism that glyph implemented for
rpys, but I don't remember how it works. IIRC, you just add "cache()" to the
top of your .rpy, or something. Unfortunately, it's not documented as it is.
Can someone comment on this? I'll add some docstrings to ResourceScript
if someone explains it.

In itself, it doesn't, but that caching mechanism I mentioned in my last email
uses it (I just went and read the source in twisted/web/script.py)

And the scope of the registry is one per top-level static.File instance; i.e.,
if you have a web server set up with `mktap web --path foo', then there will
only be one Registry unless you create some static.Files explicitly elsewhere.

It looks like he meant to just say "isLeaf = True". It's expected to be an 
attribute, not a method. It worked accidentally because all function objects
are True.

What isLeaf *does* is to say "Stop looking for more children beyond me".
i.e., this resource will not have `getChild' called on it; it will be
immediately render()ed. You can handle the rest of the path segments by
accessing them through the request object passed to the render method.

Oops. 'isLeaf' is a boolean attribute, not a function. It is usually set at
the class level, and overrides t.w.r.Resource's default of '0'. So this class
should really be written as follows:

  class ReportRequest(twisted.web.resource.Resource):
      isLeaf = 1

(the ReportRequest example worked because a bound method happens to be "true"
when evaluated in a conditional. However, it would never have been able to
return "false").

'isLeaf' is a flag tells the server to stop walking through the URL path.
Each slash-delimited component of the URL is put into a list, and the
resource tree is walked (the Site is asked for a child indexed by the first
component, that child is asked for one indexed by the second, etc). If a
child is returned with the .isLeaf flag set, the walk is terminated, and that
child is responsible for dealing with the rest of the path on its own. The
request.postpath array contains the remaining components of the URL.

This is useful when you want to change the resource lookup behavior below
some sub-node of the URL tree. Above the child that sets .isLeaf=1, the usual
Resource.getChild() scheme is used to find a Resource. Below that, the child
can do whatever it wants.

For example, let's pretend that we have a web server which serves users'
~/public_html/ directories, but each user is in a department, and the URL is
always supposed to look like http://foo.com/Department/User/Dir/Subdir/File .
The top two levels of the tree (department and user) must do some kind of
lookup to find out who is in which department and where their home directory
is. The child that is returned by the User lookup would set .isLeaf=1, and
then get the actual file based upon the directory path contained in the
remaining part of the URL. We're basically breaking the URL into two pieces:
[http://foo.com/Department/User], and [Dir/Subdir/File]. The resource tree is
walked with the first part, but the second part is given all at once (as a
list) to the results of the lookup on the first part.

 class MySite(Resource):
  def getChild(self, path, request):
    dept = self.findDepartment(path) # returns a DepartmentResource
    if dept == None:
        return error.NoResource("No such department '%s'" % path)
    return dept

 class DepartmentResource(Resource):
  def getChild(self, path, request):
    user = self.findUser(path) # returns a UserResource
    if user == None:
        return error.NoResource("No such user '%s'" % path)
    return user
  
 class UserResource(Resource):
  isLeaf = 1 # don't call our .getChild(), just do render()
  def render(self, request):
    # rest of URL is in request.postpath
    for p in request.postpath:
      if p == "..": return error.NoResource("naughty naughty")
    filename = os.path.join(self.homedir(), "public_html", request.postpath)
    file = File(filename)
    return file.render(request)


I'm sure there are better examples of isLeaf out there.. this is what comes
to my mind when I see that flag.


cheers,
 -Brian

Sorry if the word offended anyone, it surely was not my intent to do so.

I only meant that if there is really no advantage at reloading an RPY file,
then there is an advantage at loading it only once (unless such RPY files
are so numerous or so big that it would create a memory problem, but it
might likely not be the case in practice), which is avoiding spurious or
useless re-initialisation.  Then, the proper way would be to use a two-liner
for each such file, and having such small bootstraps is questionable.

If a resource was consuming a lot of memory, I would understand.  But as you
just explained, RPY files are meant to be tiny, and then unlikely to build
tons of fresh bytes in Python structures.

Yet, within a small RPY file, one might import from library big modules
having Resource based classes, and resources are meant to be freed
immediately after having been consumed.  For example, such a library
resource might define some big triple-quoted static string holding the
template of an HTML page.  But then, the module will stay imported after the
RPY file disappears, the big string will not be freed, and reloading will
not trigger significant memory savings.  If the template string gets read
from disk each time, it will likely be kept in a local variable in the
`render' method, and will be freed as soon as we exit that method, so
reloading does not in itself trigger memory savings in that case either.

So, just to help me understand, could you illustrate by an example, a likely
case demonstrating the flexibility gained by multiple reloading?

It might be those Registry instances which Moshe referred to in a recent
message, and which are sketched a bit quickly in the book, page 23, (2.3.2
"Using Twisted.Web", section "Resource Scripts").

The two are actually logically the same, but I prefer yours because it puts
off the creation of the NoResource error until it is really necessary. Fixed

Brian and Christopher, let me thank you both for your replies.

I did not find a presentation in the manual (but I'm far from having read it
all yet) about a tree organisation of resources.  Brian's explanation is
quite comprehensive, and in my opinion, should happily find its way into the
current Twisted book.  Is there someone listening, who is taking care of
such things?  We surely have good documentation material in Brian's reply!

     --------------------

I also found, by re-reading various saved messages from the list, that three
of them were especially instructive about the nature and justification of
TAPs, which are:

   2003-02-14 07:42 -0500  Glyph Lefkowitz <glyph at twistedmatrix.com>
   2003-02-11 15:17 -0500  Glyph Lefkowitz <glyph at twistedmatrix.com>
   2003-02-11 01:35 -0500  Moshe Zadka <twisted at moshez.org>

all having "In Defense of Taps (was Re: [Twisted-Python] where to begin)"
for a Subject.  Also likely interesting for users is:

   2003-02-12 08:51 -0500  Glyph Lefkowitz <glyph at twistedmatrix.com>

In all these messages, and surely others, there is documentation material
that could be retrofitted in the Twisted manual (editing out some unwanted
parts and maybe rephrasing others).  Is there someone, taking care of the
documentation, to whom I should direct a copy of the above (if needed)?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] spawnProcess and environment inheritance
Message-ID: <20030429.142353.133032176.warner@lothar.com>

I wanted to ask what people thought about a potential change to the way
reactor.spawnProcess() sets up the child's environment variables.

The current default is to provide an empty environment to the child:
reactor.spawnProcess() has a env={} default parameter. I'm wondering if this
should be changed to env=None, which would instruct os.execvpe() to let the
child inherit the environment from the parent process.

This showed up in a recent test_process.py failure, which effectively
compared a "file not found" error message obtained with popen3() against a
similar one retrieved with reactor.spawnProcess(). The test failed when it
was run in a localized environment. popen3() inherited $LANG from the parent
(in this case, LANG was set to French), and the error message came out in one
language, whereas spawnProcess() cleared the environment, and the error came
out in English. The two didn't match, so the test harness thought
spawnProcess had somehow failed.

I've changed test_process.py to explicitly pass env=None to all child
processes, but given that Python's popen2 and os.exec library functions all
default to inheritance rather than an empty environment, I'm thinking it
might be a good idea to match them and have spawnProcess() default to
inheritance too.

pros: Less surprise factor for those used to normal unix behavior. Would
reduce the differences between programs run from the shell and those run from
inside spawnProcess.

cons: Sometimes you want to clean the environment as a security measure. The
existing behavior has been around for a while and changing it might cause
problems.

What do you all think?

The change in question, in case you'd like to try it out, would be the
following one-liner:

Send it to the list, or if you think it's too large, post it on a website
somewhere and send the URL to the list.

You are welcome to send it directly to me, but then you'll miss out on feedback

Message-ID: <200304300801.h3U815Q05758@localhost.localdomain>

I kinda suspected that twisted might be slower than asyncore for the
straight go-hell-for-leather usage in pythondirector, but I'd not got
around to actually testing it. It seems like it's nearly 30% slower
than the equivalent asyncore code! This seems a bit higher than I'd
expect -- but given all the extra overhead of object creation I guess
it's not all that surprising. Current CVS python, Twisted 1.0.4.

Has anyone else done similar benchmarking and found different results?
I'm not planning on switching the default back to asyncore - the 
asyncore code is just too brittle for my tastes.

(FWIW, the two equivalent modules are 
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/pythondirector/pythondirector/pydirector/pdnetworktwisted.py?only_with_tag=HEAD
and 
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/pythondirector/pythondirector/pydirector/pdnetworkasyncore.py?only_with_tag=HEAD
)

A wiki could be ideal for this... examples and documentation draft.

I post two times my example, and it's the first time somebody correct it,
if i didn't look at the list (i'm very busy now) i could post the
mistake again...
Maybe somebody will look in the archive and use my first post with the
mistake !

A wiki would probably be just as bad -- if people aren't looking in the list
archives for unreplied to patches, they won't check the wiki either, and
things would get lost.

The current recommended strategy is to post to the list, maybe post a
reminder (like you just did... thanks! :), and finally, if we still haven't
responded, add it to our bug tracker on SourceForge, so we won't forget it
for eternity.

Pestering random developers on IRC can work well, too, but that can require
a fair bit your time to make that work :)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] mktap dns is broken if you switch subnets
Message-ID: <20030430160159.GA28522@lapdog>

	Hi. Lately, I've been playing with using "mktap dns" as a
	resolver for my laptop. Except, it's making me angry.

	It doesn't reload resolv.conf. My resolv.conf nameserver list
	is changed by DHCP about twice per day, atleast.

	In fact, it even loads the resolv.conf only in __init__, so
	the list gets stored in the tap file. I need to mktap, tap2deb
	and dpkg -i whenever I switch subnets!

	Here's a quick-and-stupid patch that makes it reload
	resolv.conf regularly, currently made to reread it every
	minute. This is "close enough". Actually, I want to make
	it get a notification from somewhere..

	I definitely want this implemented. Please tell what direction
	should I go with the patch, and what do you think is missing
	from "production quality"?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] NNTP/SMTP authentication
Message-ID: <1051723673.639.18.camel@mingus>

Hi folks,

In order to really get NNTP and SMTP (securely) integrated with Hep I
need to get authentication working.  Both of these protocols support
authentication, although it's not required by the core RFCs.  But as far
as I can tell neither of the modules in twisted/protocols supports
authentication at the moment.

Is anyone working on this already?  If not, I'd like to do it myself,
and I'd appreciate some help in understanding the 'right' way to
implement authentication in Twisted.  I've been looking at J.P.'s IMAP4
work in CVS, and I can see he's using identities and perspectives
(although I don't have a complete understanding of how these work).  Is
the use of twisted.cred preferred?  Other drivers, such as POP3, don't
seem to use it...

Thanks,

Abe

  If you don't get to it first, I may end up doing SMTP authentication
sometime in the near future (as I have need for it as well).  I hadn't given
much thought to NNTP.

  I think POP3 should be updated to use cred in a manner similar to that
which IMAP4 uses it.  Since I wrote IMAP4, obviously I think that is the
right way to do authentication ;) (modulo one thing - the actual
challenge/response verification should be factored out and away from the
Identity class - I believe itamar and glyph have discussed this and have
some ideas for the implementation).

  Whether the *actual* details of how IMAP4 is using cred are proper are
not, I don't know ;) The code works, but it seems that there are too many
different objects involved in the process (CramMD5Identity,
CramMD5ServerAuthenticator, CramMD5ClientAuthenticator - and that's just for
*one* kind of authentication scheme).  Setup is similarly tedious, requiring
4 lines of "boilerplate" to set things up, and then *10* lines to add each
new identity.  Now that imap4.py is settling down, it'd be great if someone
with more experience with cred could take a look at it and give me some
feedback.

  Maybe there will be a coil for cred someday so you can keep this part of
the code out of your actual app, though.  If so, this is one of the real
strengths of cred.  Your app doesn't have to do anything to manage user
accounts, you just attach the cred coil and you're done.


  Hope this helps,

  Jp

  It would be great if Twisted could speak FAM.  I looked briefly at
integrating the python wrapper, but didn't have time to go very in-depth.

  It basically looks good.  One thing I'd like done differently is to have
parseConfig() called at a different time.  Possibly calling it as a result
of connectionMade() further increases an already large latency on queries. 
If this were done in a callLater() loop, this would keep the parsing
overhead out of the path of actual queries the client performs.

  As a short term solution, I think this is reasonable (but the point is
moot if we wrap and use libfam).  How's it sound to you?

I'll make a deal with you - if you do SMTP authentication (demonstrating
the 'right way to do it'), I'll write a similar patch for NNTP :-)

That would be nice.  It seems like there's also the potential to share
the code for different methods of authentication between
POP3/SMTP/IMAP/NNTP - I think they all can use CRAM-MD5, for example,
and it seems silly to duplicate the code in each protocol.

	Well, it'll need a secondary mechanism anyway, as FAM
	is far from portable.

	Besides, FAM is a daemon. The actual kernel interface
	it uses is called "dnotify", and it goes like this:

fd = open(".", O_RDONLY);
fcntl(fd, F_SETSIG, SIGRTMIN);
fcntl(fd, F_NOTIFY, DN_MODIFY|DN_CREATE|DN_MULTISHOT);

	and you'll get an SIGRTMIN every time the dir changes. Allocating
	an available signal sounds like this is something that should first
	be "twistedified", and not used raw.

	This might not even need any C wrapping, or at most exposing
	those DN_* and F_* constants.

	If you really want to use that API, and the DN_* constants
	aren't exported by standard python, it'd be trivial to add
	them to eunuchs. And fall back to statting the file every
	once in a while if eunuchs isn't installed or the kernel
	doesn't understand the fcntl.

	Yeah, sure. I ended up doing it that way just because I couldn't
	remember whether callLaters etc are pickled or not, and make it
	resume from a .tap correctly, etc..

	Okay, how about I make it check the file timestamp every n seconds
	via callLater, and commit that? Maybe tomorrow.

This is why cred is going to be refactored. With a chainsaw. On fire.
End result should be that you have to do a *lot* less work in your
protocol.

Personally, I find FAM's implementation annoying, because is uses sunrpc, and
requires the "security-compromise-waiting-to-happen" portmap daemon be
running. I wish they had implemented it with a unix socket instead, but it
appears to be aimed at handling remote (NFS) directory changes as well as
local ones. Something less server-heavy would seem more appropriate.

The Linux mechanism is DNotify, and you can get at most of the functionality
from the Python side. I have code in the BuildBot (buildbot.dnotify) which
does the necessary Twisted glue, and I'd be happy to contribute that if it
seems useable. Code is available from http://buildbot.sf.net .

One problem with that module is that DNotify uses SIGIO (or other signal of
your choice) to indicate the change, and Python's signal-delivery code
doesn't pass the siginfo_t argument to the Python handler, which means
multiple DNotify notifications for the same process all look the same.

That buildbot code also falls back to polling every 10 seconds if the DNotify
fcntl values aren't available (e.g. non-linux).

So you are thinking of factoring out the case sensitive relations code?

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted 1.0.4 - NameVirtualHost and isLeaf
Message-ID: <oqu1cfleih.fsf@titan.progiciels-bpi.ca>

Hi, people.

Thanks to the recent explanations about `isLeaf', I was able to figure out
that if, with Twisted 1.0.4, I was unable to get virtual hosts to work, this
was because the `isLeaf' attribute of an instance of `vhost.NameVirtualHost'
is not True.  At least with the setup I use.  the instance's `render' method
is not called then, and consequently, the dispatching to the proper resource
does not occur.

In what circumstance would it be useful that such an instance has `isLeaf'
set to False?  I presume this might help me better understand resources.

Someone will surely correct me if I'm wrong, but I ran into this same
dilemma when I began to use twisted.  It seems that as twisted is an
event-driven framework for asynchronous networked applications, it isn't
intended to be used in this way.

Twisted applications should generally sit around waiting for requests,
and respond to them in a timely, but non-blocking manner.  Starting up,
doing some stuff, and exiting, just doesn't seem to be the idiom at play
here.

YMMV..

You don't want a reactor.crash() and a reactor.stop(). Just do
reactor.stop().

Using threads can make your python program not exit if they hang around,
but reactor.stop() should shut down all threads in the thread pool.

Dunno what you mean by "this way". If you need to deal with a blocking
database operation you dispatch it to the thread pool, and that works
just fine.

That 'failure.py' is looking like some tasty low-hanging fruit to me,
but doSelect should be amenable to some speedups as well...

I should probably add that even though Twisted is slower than asyncore,
pythondirector using Twisted is still 10-15% faster than the written-in-C 
"Pound" load balancer, and about 5% slower than the "balance" load balancer
(also in C).

  Boy would it be great if Failures could be sped up some more, but it
doesn't seem likely without some mind-bending rework of the whole design. 
I think most, if not all, of the worthwhile local optimizations have been
made on it.

  What I learned from Twisted.names is to not write code that uses Failures
anywhere except where they are absolutely necessary.  Python exceptions
might be cheap enough to use as a kind of fancy flow control, but failures
definitely are not.
