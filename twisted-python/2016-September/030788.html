<PRE>Tristan Seligmann &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python">mithrandi at mithrandi.net</A>&gt; writes:

&gt;<i> Currently there is no way to explicitly compose Twisted endpoints, but
</I>&gt;<i> several endpoint implementations have arisen that explicitly wrap
</I>&gt;<i> another endpoint, and so have needed a way to do this.
</I>
A couple other examples:

Autobahn provides 'Web Application Messaging Protocol' (WAMP) endpoints
that can use either a Unix, TCP or WebSockets protocol under the hood --
having a proper endpoint syntax for this would be nice. There is *some*
support for endpoint-strings in Autobahn using the backslash trick, but
this also results in some ugliness like:

   r&quot;autobahn:tcp\:9000\:interface\=0.0.0.0:url=ws\://localhost\:9000:compress=false&quot;
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ideally txtorcon would have a way to specify &quot;how&quot; to connect for
client-side connections meaning &quot;I want a stream over the Tor whose
control-port is 'unix:/foo' that connects via SOCKS at unix:/bar to
<A HREF="https://meejah.ca">https://meejah.ca</A>&quot;. (This can only be done in code, currently, not
endpoint-strings) Now think about specifying that you want the above
Autobahn connection to go over Tor ;) that is, replacing
&quot;<A HREF="https://meejah.ca">https://meejah.ca</A>&quot; with the monster above...

     *   *   *

On a possible tangent: I wonder if this also ties in with trying to wrap
protocols to &quot;hand off&quot; their transport to another one? Examples of this
are: SOCKS (e.g. speaking one protocol &quot;after&quot; another), or in Autobahn
where it's nice to listen for both &quot;normal&quot; Web requests and also
WebSockets requests on the same port (so there's a protocol that &quot;peeks&quot;
and hands off to HTTP or WebSockets handlers).

I can also imagine doing the same thing with <A HREF="http://magic-wormhole.io">http://magic-wormhole.io</A>
where you would establish a connection via the wormhole mechanism, and
then pass over the established transport to the &quot;real&quot; protocol
(e.g. could be HTTP, WAMP, SSH, WebSockets, something custom, etc) and
this at least has an obvious need for a corresponding string-parser
syntax like the one suggested.

&gt;<i> tls:awesome.site.example.com:443-&gt;tcp:7.6.5.4:443 A less whimsical
</I>&gt;<i> syntax than &quot;-&gt;&quot; might be better; for example, semicolons, or
</I>&gt;<i> something like that.
</I>
I wonder if a simple space would work? Downsides would be: requiring
quoting on shells; maybe it would present problems in config-file
use-cases; ...

So, we want &quot;something&quot; the highest-level parser can split on before
handing off bits (or all) of it to the actual plugins:

 - can't have &quot;:&quot; since that's already a separatator
 - can't have &quot;=&quot; since it's already used
 - shouldn't already be in popular protocols/options (e.g. anything
   valid in a URI?)

In some ways having a two-character separator could be really nice, as
it's far less likely to collide with things? I like that the intent of
&quot;-&gt;&quot; is also reasonably obvious, I think. Or at least hopefully looks
strange enough that you'll look it up ;)

Thanks for kicking off discussion :)
