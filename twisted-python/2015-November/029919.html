<PRE>Hello,

I submitted some patches yesterday, got review from Adi and today I tried
to respond. However I'm not able to respond because all my submissions are
marked as spam and blocked by SpamBayes with super high probability. I
wonder how many other users experience that problem?

Can you please fix SpamBayes? I dont think there is anything in my messages
that warrants calling it spam.

Since I'm not able to update ticket in any way I'm going to post my message
here. It's about ticket <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/8102">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/8102</A> my
response is following:


Thanks for review adiroiban!

&gt;<i> I assume that people will try to keep US-ASCII for their method names, so
</I>we might want to reject even valind latin1 methods.

I agree with that part. All standard HTTP method names are ascii, so I dont
see much reason to support non-ascii HTTP methods. They were not supported
before this patch (they caused failures), if we fix that and allow latin1
we will allow characters that are outside ascii in method names, e.g. users
will be able to have non-standard latin1 method name: 'GET&#163;'. In my opinion
it's better to only allow ascii and nothing else.

&gt;<i> For non US-ASCII or non latin1 encoding, I think that we should reject
</I>the request much earlier. That is when we first parse the request line, and
not when we try to process the request

Yes I agree, so patch should go somewhere to
twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel.linereceived when we first get method (line
1709) right? Also is it ok we raise 501? With current patch we raise 501
Not Suppoted but maybe 400 Bad Request would be better here?
