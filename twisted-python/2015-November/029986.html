That is relatively straightforward.

Typically, application-layer code doesn't retry a DNS lookup; rather the 
c or other runtime will handle this, for example getaddrinfo() in glibc, 
according to settings read from /etc/resolv.conf or compiled-in defaults.

So it depends on whether you want to emulate &quot;typical&quot; application code, 
a specific application stack that may or may not do it's own resolution 
(e.g. modern browsers) or something else.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * how long does it take to get the first bytes of the endpoint
</I>&gt;<i>    - how long does it take to complete the TCP connection handshake

</I>
Some of this is available in platform-specific APIs e.g. SIOCGSTAMP and 
TCP_INFO socket options available on Linux.

In general, any timings you make based on return of control from kernel 
will include error relating to system/scheduling issues. If you're 
concerned about getting raw, on-the-wire timings, this is extremely 
difficult without being in-kernel, and even then various issues - TCP 
offload for example - can end up hiding data from you.

&gt;<i> How far can I do this kind of things with Twisted? I know I can somewhat

</I>&gt;<i> handshake also and the time to first byte(s), but what about the

</I>&gt;<i> the underlying details of the TCP protocol are exposed to the upper
</I>&gt;<i> layer such as Twisted?
</I>
Only via platform-specific options.

To do this kind of thing &quot;reliably&quot;, you'd need to reimplement TCP in 
user-space.

But the info above may be a helpful start.
