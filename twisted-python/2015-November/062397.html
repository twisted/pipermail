<PRE>Hello everyone!

Hot off the presses comes Twisted 15.5.0pre1, the prerelease of Twisted 15.5, which has been described by some as &quot;totally radical&quot; and &quot;off the wall&quot;.

In this release:

- Python 3.5 support on POSIX was added, and Python 2.6 support was dropped.
- More than nine additional modules have been ported to Python 3, ranging from Twisted Web's Agent and downloadPage, twisted.python.logfile, and many others, as well as...
- twistd is ported to Python 3, and its first plugin, web, is ported.
- twisted.python.url, a new URL/IRI abstraction, has been introduced to answer the question &quot;just what IS a URL&quot; in Twisted, once and for all.
- NPN and ALPN support has been added to Twisted's TLS implementation, paving the way for HTTP/2.
- Conch now supports the DH group14-sha1 and group-exchange-sha256 key exchange algorithms, as well as hmac-sha2-256 and hmac-sha2-512 MAC algorithms. Conch also works nicer with newer OpenSSH implementations.
- Twisted's IRC support now has a sendCommand() method, which enables the use of sending messages with tags.
- 55+ closed tickets overall.

As usual, it's available for download -- go here (<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/15.5.0pre1/">https://twistedmatrix.com/Releases/pre/15.5.0pre1/</A>) to get the prerelease tarballs and the full NEWS file.

Please let me know if you have any issues, as well as if you don't! If everything works well, that's a good thing for me to know :)

Thanks! &lt;3
