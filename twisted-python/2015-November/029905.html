&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I am bringing this to the list for a greater audience and to reach
</I>&gt;<i> all borders and timezones :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks!


&gt;<i> General rules by Glyph as they were sent to me :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Development can't stop, the website can't go down, and we can't lose
</I>&gt;<i> any data. If you have a plan that migrates absolutely everything to
</I>&gt;<i> github, including all of our issues to github issues, and all of our
</I>&gt;<i> review queue stuff to github PRs, that is fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Glyph, would it be OK to have, say, a half-hour period where people
couldn't file tickets?

You cannot, however, just push everything to github and delete the
&gt;<i> ticket database and all the outstanding branches and just say &quot;okay
</I>&gt;<i> everybody file github issues now&quot;. There has to be clear communication
</I>&gt;<i> about what a developer who shows up on any given day to work on a
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted ticket should do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Current requirements from Glyph:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - be able to accept PRs on github.com
</I>&gt;<i> - host code primarily on github
</I>&gt;<i> - make sure all the same committers still have access (at least active
</I>&gt;<i> ones)
</I>&gt;<i> - make sure the website doesn't go down
</I>&gt;<i> - break as little functionality as possible (kenaan, highscores, etc)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'd suggest making a list of such things.


&gt;<i> - communicate clearly to contributors what they have to do in order to
</I>
work on Twisted in every step of the process
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This means email to this list, and updates to documentation both in the
code base and on the wiki.


&gt;<i> ------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also from Glyph
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> there are lots of &quot;nice to have&quot; things like it would be nice to have
</I>&gt;<i> people authenticate to twistedmatrix.com via github so we can get rid
</I>&gt;<i> of our terrible auth database  and so they have one set of credentials
</I>&gt;<i> for working
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice if we could automatically sync any relevant
</I>&gt;<i> information between PRs and issues
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -----------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>All of the above constitutes requirements and constraints rather than a
plan per se. I've found it useful to have such things written down
somewhere more solid (normally, a Google doc) so that when I think I'm done
I have something to check against.

Questions below are about the plan. I'm asking questions


&gt;<i> I would prefer to do baby steps and as a start just have the main repo
</I>&gt;<i> in git hosted by github.com.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Fully agree w/ baby steps.

Could you provide some more details about what this means? Oh, I just
reread further down and see you'll be sending a more detailed plan through
later. Carry on.


&gt;<i> Using GitHub it will force us (for the better or for the worse) to
</I>&gt;<i> rethink the infrastructure using web hooks... and for &quot;modern&quot; hosting
</I>&gt;<i> platforms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This sounds as if you're saying that some functionality will be broken
initially. I'm personally OK with that, but it would be good to get some
sense of which functionality.


&gt;<i> Once we have webhooks we should be able to migrate to any other
</I>&gt;<i> provider... so it should be for the better
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Quite right.


&gt;<i> Also, we need to migrate to GitHub as this was already agreed (one
</I>&gt;<i> year ago) ... and if we re-start the conversation regarding the
</I>&gt;<i> hosting platform, we are back on point 0 and still on SVN.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Amen.


&gt;<i> We don't plan to migrate to GitHub Issues / GitHub Wiki / GitHub Pages
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ah, OK. This makes the comments about Github Auth make a lot more sense.


&gt;<i> -------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So... if you have anything to comment regarding the git / github.com
</I>&gt;<i> migration please send your feedback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Later we will announce the plan , break it into small task and start
&gt;<i> working on them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Oh right. I look forward to this. May I suggest that one component of the
plan be a timeline of the migration, where at each stage we show both the
things done by the migrator and the experience of Twisted developers during
that time?


&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> Adi Roiban
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thanks Adi. Great to see this happening.
