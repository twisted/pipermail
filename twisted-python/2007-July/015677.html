Is there really a need for a prefix?

In case of the &quot;py&quot; prefix, it seems packages can be divided into two 
categories:
1. applications that happen to be implemented in Python
2. things Python developers can use, such as Python bindings for an existing 
C/C++ library

In my opinion, category 1 is just developers who can't think of a good name. 
For the end user the implementation language is mostly irrelevant, so 
the &quot;py&quot; prefix does not really add information, it just turns a word into a 
name. I know it's hard to find a good name for a project, but should they be 
offered an excuse to give up trying?

For category 2, maybe a prefix is useful, for example for wrapping a library 
so it uses Deferreds, or for integrating event loops. Are there many projects 
like this? The only one I know of is sAsync. Projects like Nevow that are not 
a layer around something existing would not really benefit from a prefix, I 
think, since they would still need a name to apply the prefix to.


One possible approach for a package-for-Twisted naming convention would be to 
use &quot;-ed&quot; as a postfix. Most base names will likely be nouns, but those can 
be verbed for extra silliness. For example the IRC bot would be 
named &quot;Botted&quot;.

Having a convention like that acts as an extra incentive to a developer to 
come up with an original name that does not use the conventional postfix. ;)

Bye,
