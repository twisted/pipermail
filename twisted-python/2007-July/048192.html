<PRE>Hi Brian,

I am in the process of converting some of my code to use zope.schema
instead of a similar thing that I independently invented.  Since I am
also planning on using Foolscap, and since Foolscap has a schema
module, I compared zope.schema and foolscap.schema, and to me they
seem to have much overlap in design intent.  In particular, in the
zope.schema use cases ...

<A HREF="http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/Zope3SchemasUseCases">http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/Zope3SchemasUseCases</A>

... one of the cases cited is:

     Method uses schema for its arguments

     A more general case than above, any method can provide a schema to
     which its arguments should conform. This schema can be used to
     create a form or to validate arguments upon any call.

... which seems almost exactly the foolscap.schema use case.  Moreover,
zope.schema has &quot;constraints&quot; that are similar in concept to the ones
in foolscap.schema.

So I was wondering -- would it make sense to use zope.schema
in Foolscap?  I plan to use them in my code, so from my own selfish
point of view that would be nice because it would unify everything
relating to the schema concept, and I wouldn't have to have separate
usages and imports of zope.schema and foolscap.schema.

Although &quot;There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious
way to do it&quot; doesn't necessarily -- or even that often -- apply to
libraries, this might be a good case for applying it, for reasons
somewhat similar those underlying twisted's adoption of
zope.interface.

A nice practical factor is that zope.schema has been packaged as
a separate namespace module, similarly to zope.interface.

I'd be interested to know your thoughts.

Cheers,
Steve
