<PRE>Thank you for all your comments!

I think I'll be looking at Vertex because I also need the actual UDP 
hole-punching - the whole Vertex solution.

My dream or idea is to have p2p file sharing with webdav and real 
mounted file systems on *NIX and Windows.

So I can &quot;export&quot; e.g. my /home/peter/projects writable to my other 
machines as &quot;projects&quot;, and /home/peter/public_ro as &quot;public&quot; read-only 
to Fred, Sally and Alice.

I import Paul's &quot;jokes&quot; share as /mnt/p2pdav/paulsJokes, and Sandy's 
&quot;pics&quot; share as /mnt/p2pdav/sandy/pics. And then access these files as 
network drives.

Possibly later have /home/peter/projects be automatically synchronized 
between all my machines.

Thats the basic idea anyway.

Well, this looks like the right fit for me. I realize this project is 
not small, but it is an itch I've had for a long time, and it needs 
scratching!!! But it is a personal-free-time project, so we'll see how 
fast it goes... :-)

Sincerely,

Peter
