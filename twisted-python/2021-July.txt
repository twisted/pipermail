When making a python3 virtualenv and installing twisted I get
t/i/process.py that has .itervalues() in it, but this was fixed 3 months
ago (https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9933).

```

Yes, this is expected. We haven't had a release in the last 3 months.  The main issue is that we don't currently have any volunteers to be release manager.

Hi,

Only now I had time to check the Twisted IRC channel and it looks like the
channels are no longer registered ... and the IRC bot is not recording the
logs.

Should we continue to use IRC or move to gitter or something else that has
history and offline messages by default?

Cheers

Hi,

I don't have much time or much "need" but if needed I can help with a new
Twisted release.

I am still working on py3 migration as an urgent task so I am stuck with
20.3.0.

There was a lot of confusion / miscommunication / non-cooperation lately
with the Twisted release process.

For example, I don't know when a new release is required / appropriate.

Maybe we can look at doing 2 releases per year around December and June, or
sync with Ubuntu releases?
What do you think?.

My plan is to have the release process documented and automated so that
anyone can take the role of the release manager for a certain release.

The current documentation for the release is here
https://docs.twistedmatrix.com/en/twisted-21.2.0/core/development/policy/release-process.html

Happy to recessive feedback and PRs for the current documentation.

--------

I don't see any tickets flagged as regressions in Trac (
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/report/26) so I guess that we can cut a
release right away.

----------

I am thinking of a scenario in which person X sends a PR that is merged and
that person X needs a new release so the same person X can act as release
manager for that release.
I don't know if that will work :)

Cheers

Hi Adi,

IRC has moved to Libera.Chat <https://libera.chat/> due to the Freenode implosion <https://lwn.net/Articles/857140/>. The channel names are the same --- #twisted, #twisted-dev, #twisted.web.

Freenode is dead, but Twisted has registered #twisted and #twisted-dev on libera.chat.

Thanks for the info.

I guess that the website can be updated to no longer mention freenode -
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/


Is there a web log?

That, and kenaan needs to be reconfigured to point at the new network. Please scrub any mention of freenode that you find from the docs & website.

My own preference is to just do them as often as we have capacity for. More releases means peoples’ work gets into the world faster, there’s more motivation to work on Twisted, more features means more users and more users means more potential contributors and it’s a virtuous cycle.


However since I personally have the bandwidth to do zero (0) releases per year myself, this does mean that others get to dictate the schedule ;-). If you’d like to do these two, other volunteers can do more (and more than one planned release manager at a time would be great). If at all possible, I think one per quarter, so four per year, would be a good lower bound to aim for. (Among other things, a quarterly cycle makes it easier to align with a popular style of resource planning in many companies.)

So say we all! Thanks for all your work towards making this happen so far.

I am updating wiki as no review is required.

I have updated the wiki to point to #twisted-dev instead of #twisted-admin
. I think that we no longer need a separate admin channel and Twisted
admins can join #twisted-dev

I will look at create a PR for the remaining doc and setup.cfg/pypi
Or if anyone wants to do that, I am happy to review :)

This looks like a good reason to trigger a new release.

Does anyone know any software as a service IRC logger?

Otherwise, I think that `kenaan` can be updated to record the logs to a
simple TXT file one per day and server those files via HTTP.
It will not be very useful but at least there is some sort of record that
can be referenced from a ticket of a PR.

I have created the release ticket and will create the release branch and RC
soon.

There is now a PR with README update for freenode removal that is waiting
to be reviewed.
https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1611

It would be nice to have it as part of the next  release so that the PYPi
page is updated, but I don't consider it a blocker.

I am planning to create the release branch soon.

I plan to do the release based on the updated documentation from
https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1616

That is, create the release branch, push the packages to PyPI and only
after these steps as for a review for the PR
and send the release candidate announcement.

Let me know if the release pull request should have an approved review
before pushing the release candidate files to PyPi.

There is one blocker PR for the release as the newsfragment checks are
failing on the release branch... since the code is executed on the
to-be-merged on a branch named by GitHub Action something like
refs/pull/1617/merge

so the new fragment check fails to detect it as a release branch...as a
release branch should have a name starting with 'release-'

The PR is here. Any feedback will help to get this merge
https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1617

This PR is important as I want to have a green release branch.

For the previous release, we just ignored the failure and did the release
anyway
But for this release I want it fixed :)

------------

This is also a non-blocker PR which contains a minor clarification for the
release process

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted 21.7.0 Pre-Release Announcement
Message-ID: <CAFycZ9durGN9vvzN8sguE5Y_e21UEmk=XBm0YgNtR36N6Rq4RA@mail.gmail.com>

On behalf of the Twisted contributors I announce the release candidate of
Twisted 21.7.0

This is mostly a bugfix release.

*Python 3.5 is no longer a supported platform.*
*The minimum supported platform is Python 3.6.7.*

The notable features are:

- Python 3.10 beta is now a supported platform.
- twisted.web.template.renderElement() now accepts any IRequest implementer
instead of only twisted.web.server.Request. Add type hints to
twisted.web.template. (#10184)

The release and NEWS file is available for review at

    https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1614/files

Release candidate documentation is available at

    https://twisted--1614.org.readthedocs.build/en/1614/

Wheels for the release candidate are available on PyPI

    https://pypi.org/project/Twisted/21.7.0rc1/

    python -m pip install Twisted==21.7.0rc1

Please test it and report any issues.
If nothing comes up in 1 week, 21.7.0 will be released based on the latest
release candidate.

Many thanks to everyone who had a part in Twisted - the supporters of the
Twisted Software Foundation, the developers, and all the people testing and
building great things with Twisted!

Thank you Adi!  Very glad to see us collectively getting back on the release-management horse again!  And it was super encouraging to see how quickly you were able to get this out, with all the automation that everyone (not least of all yourself) has been building to make this process faster and simpler.

It appears we've buried the lede on one of our biggest features in this release though - https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1448/files <https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1448/files> had no newsfile that shows up in the changelog, but it properly made Deferred into a generic, so I think this is the first release of Twisted where you might reasonably be able to use mypy without your own custom stub files! :)

Message-ID: <d28bad6a-3c50-33f7-547d-65629cdd4727@haywood.id.au>

I am trying to work out how to retrieve on the server a X.509 
certificate presented by the HTTPS client.  This code tries to tell me 
the transport has no peer certificate.

same error when I use wget as a client so I think my problem is in the 
server code. I'm using self-signed certificates

Any clues as to what I'm doing wrong?

It's been quite a while since I tried to do this, but:

For starters, you need to specify the certificate authority that will be validating your client's certificates.  I forget the precise specifics, but I believe if you don't specify a CA that will be used, it won't prompt the client to present a certificate in the first place, and also there's nothing for your endpoint to validate against, so what would it even do if the client did present one, other than let you retrieve it? The point is not to inspect the certificate but to authenticate it, an API that let you inspect it without first validating it against a CA would be a security nightmare.  And generally client certs are not understood to be validated by webtrust CAs, so "just validate it like usual" doesn't apply, since you can't check the SANs for a hostname.

There's a guide to doing this programmatically here: https://docs.twistedmatrix.com/en/twisted-21.2.0/core/howto/ssl.html#tls-server-with-client-authentication-via-client-certificate-verification <https://docs.twistedmatrix.com/en/twisted-21.2.0/core/howto/ssl.html#tls-server-with-client-authentication-via-client-certificate-verification> - I believe that this edge-case is not supported by endpoints.serverFromString.

If it's within your control to avoid, don't use client certificate authentication from HTTPS clients.  It unnecessarily leaks a bunch of peripheral information to the service you're authenticating to, the UX is a disaster on basically every browser, and most of the big players have stopped caring about this use-case in favor of things like webauthn that properly exist entirely outside of the setup process for a secure channel.  I confess I used to think client cert auth was really cool myself, but luckily nothing I did with it ever took off :-).

That said: as long as the use-case exists, Twisted should have good support for it.  Adding a clientCA argument to twisted.internet.endpoints._parseSSL so that serverFromString would support it would be a pretty simple PR to put together, so if you've got to bite the bullet on this, a contribution to close the gap here would be appreciated.  Twisted is nothing if not a tool that should make it seamless to integrate with every bad idea anyone's had in a protocol design ;-).

As commented by Glyph you will first need  to setup one or a list of
accepted CAs.

Then setup custom server-side context.

Add the CA via
https://www.pyopenssl.org/en/stable/api/ssl.html#OpenSSL.SSL.Context.load_verify_locations

This is done via
https://www.pyopenssl.org/en/stable/api/ssl.html#OpenSSL.SSL.Context.set_verify
to define a path or dir
or implement a custom one via
https://www.pyopenssl.org/en/stable/api/ssl.html#OpenSSL.SSL.Context.get_cert_store

Without set_verify, during the TLS/SSL handshake the server will not ask
the client to send its own certificate.

---------

I am using X509 authentication as a  passwordless authentication for
automated transfers, similar to the SSH key authentication.

The x509 certificate authentication is used by the Spanish government
across many of their services.
Taxes, customs, health service ...

FWIW I would avoid calling the pyOpenSSL APIs for this, since hopefully we'll manage to move away from OpenSSL and at least somewhat abstract away the transition.  These map to the 'caCerts' and 'verify=True' arguments to CertificateOptions, if you need more flexibility than the tutorial documentation that I linked previously: https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/20.3.0/api/twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions.html <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/20.3.0/api/twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions.html>

Are you thinking to use the Windows and macOS provided crypto API and only use openssl on Unix systems?

It would be nice to have a system for backends so that we could do this when certain specific situations call for it (usually related to TLS clients, rather than servers, although having both would be great), but no, the main motivation is to drop OpenSSL entirely in favor of Rustls, as recommended by the ISRG: <https://www.abetterinternet.org/post/preparing-rustls-for-wider-adoption/ <https://www.abetterinternet.org/post/preparing-rustls-for-wider-adoption/>>.

Hi,

I tried to send this email 9 days ago... but I was not subscribed to the
list using this email... and have not seen the bounce message... if any.

------

I just wanted to let you know that I have added Tom Most as a "core" team
member to the twisted-infra organization.

This is more of an information.
Let me know if I did something wrong
I don't know if there is any process in place for adding new members to
twisted-infra org.

Tom can merge the code but without access to the actual production server
there is not much he can do.

I think that we can give him access to the servers to help with the
infrastructure.

I have not added the keys yet, but if any other member of the team think
that this is a good idea please check with Tom what are the preferred
key/keys to be added to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Tom's SSH Keys https://api.github.com/users/twm/keys

I can also add the keys once I get some feedback.

Cheers

Hi,

Do you see any issues if we enable the auto-merge feature for
twisted/twisted?

The feature is documented here

https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/automatically-merging-a-pull-request

With this, in theory you don't have to wait for all the CI to be green
before a merge.
You got your reviews, you fix some typos that don't require a re-review and
then set the merge message and your are done.
Or there was a flaky test failure and just re-run the job and the merge
will be done once all the jobs are green again.

-------------

This can be abused if someone will enable auto-merge before the PR is
approved by a reviewer.
As most of the time the reviewer will accept the PR but will request or
suggest minor changes.
If the auto-merge is enabled, the PR is mergesd as soon as it is reviewed.

-------------

The config looks like this:

You can allow setting pull requests to merge automatically once all
required reviews and status checks have passed.

   - Allow auto-merge

   Waits for merge requirements to be met and then merges automatically.


------------

There is also the option to block a merge only after all the conversations
are marked as resolved.
I am using this for my project and it works ok... a bit annoying but can
help if you accedentally forgot to address a comment.

Cheers

Thanks Glyph and Thomas and Tom for the release notes feedback.

I was thinking that 21.7.0  is ready for the final review.

PR at https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1614

I am doing some fast-tracking here (as I now have some time)

But while writing this email, the python 3.8 and 3.9 version on GitHub VMs
were updates and we now have broken tests in trunk and in the release branch

The release blocking ticket was created at
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/10230

Please see if you can help with unlocking the release.
Thomas is already helping.
Either fix the issue, or decide if it's ok to release with this issue.

There was also another minor idna pypy update release blocker that was
already fixed by Thomas.

I was planning to push the final release on Saturday 17 of July, to allow
for a full 1 week of feedback for the release candidate.

---------

There is also a PR for updating the release docs -
https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1616

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Enable pre-commit.ci for twisted/twisted
Message-ID: <CAFycZ9c25NSzEWxd3sC56wEdj7nW9jSsMdRohHm-x+ny-3Bj6w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

As part of this PR https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1619 Thomas has
requested to enable the https://pre-commit.ci  service for twisted/twisted
repository

The pre-commit.ci is kind of an auto-pilot for our pre-commit configuration.

We already do post-commit checks via the pre-commit framework and I think
that some of the core developers have pre-commit enabled as a git hook.

The convenience if pre-commit.ci is that if you don't have the git-hook
enable and you commit dirty code, pre-commit.ci will fix it for you.

pre-commit.ci will also automatically create PR to update the pre-commit
dependencies.

This all comes at the cost of allowing the external pre-commit.ci server to
write to twisted/twisted repository.

pre-commit.ci was already enabled for twisted/ldaptor

pre-commit.ci is currently enabled for twisted/twisted for testing while a
final decision is made.

I am +0 on this change due to security reasons...but I do think that it
will reduce a bit of the frustration for first time contributors.

If there are no strong comments against enabling pre-commit.ci, in a week,
I plan to approve the PR and have the pre-commit.ci enabled for the long
term.

We can always rewoke to pre-commit.ci write access if needed.

Cheers

Can you elaborate on this a little bit?  First time contributors won't be
able to push a branch to twisted/twisted.  Does giving pre-commit.ci write
access to twisted/twisted also give it write access to forks of
twisted/twisted?  Or maybe only to branches in forks with PRs targeting
twisted/twisted?

Thanks for raising this question with the mailing list and for supplying
details about the motivation.  Given that there is no justification for the
change written on the ticket or in the PR itself, this is really helpful.

Thanks,
Jean-Paul

This looks very cool, but presents us with a problem.

mypy now complains about instantiations of Deferred without a type 
annotation:

 > d = defer.Deferred()

results in an error:

 > synapse/util/async_helpers.py:124: error: Need type annotation for 
'd'  [var-annotated]

We can't just go and add type annotations because we need to maintain 
compatibility with older Twisted (to make it possible to package in 
Debian et al).

Any suggestions for keeping mypy happy?

What is the minimum version of Python 3 that is supported?
Does that minimum versions not have the typing feature that is used?

Also I thought that mypy could imply the type of d from the assignment.
Or is that that it could later...

Disclaimer, my mypy use is not that deep yet.

Barry

I also don't have much experience with mypy, but I guess that you can
ignore the errors from twisted.internet.defer via mypy.ini

[mypy-twisted.internet.defer]
allow_untyped_defs = True

I believe so.  As a Twisted contributor you can actually push to branches of any user targeting a PR in Twisted.  I'm pretty sure repo:write for a github app grants the app similar access to a human org member.

I can't remember the exact mechanics of how this is configured, but I think that it's a side-effect of the "Require branches to be up to date before merging" setting being enabled, because that setting adds the "update branch" button to out-of-date PRs which implicitly gives the org push permission.

I'm +1; we've accepted a lot of cloud risk already, and this seems like a lot of benefit for minimal additional risk.  Is this asottile running the show?  The website is not entirely clear.

It would be extra nice if we could restrict it from pushing to `trunk` on its own though, or running any release automation.

Are you saying you need it to typecheck against older versions or just run against them?

He is. I’ve had it enabled on both structlog & argon2-cffi for a while now FWIW.

Ah, this gave me the clue I needed. We just need to run against them. 
Which means I can put type hints in comments, where they will be ignored 
at runtime. It's fiddly, but it will work well enough.

Thanks Glyph, and thanks to Adi and Barry for your suggestions too.

One particular problem I came across was the type annotation on 
inlineCallbacks. I've filed https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/10231 
about it - would appreciate thoughts.

This definitely looks wrong; there should be a TypeVar in there.  Adi, I'd go so far as to say that this should be a release blocker, although the change should be fairly minimal.

Richard, could you please make a proper PR for this to get CI kicked off and make sure the new annotation doesn't cause any failures?

External contributors can't push directly to twisted/twisted.
Their code will reach twisted/twisted vi PR... just like before

I expect that first time contributors will have their fork automatically
updated by pre-commit.ci to make the code more likely to be accepted.

For example, pre-commit will automatically run black.

I don't have any experience with pre-commit.ci  ... but this is my
expectation,

Based on the current feedback, I will approve the PR.

I think that I will do a RC2 release candidate, since due to this issue the
GHA tests on RC1 are red - https://github.com/twisted/twisted/pull/1628
So I plan to cherry-pick those changes and do a RC2.

Regarding  the release blocker, I will block the release for any ticket
from https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/report/26

Right now, I have added https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/10231 to that
report.

So, if anyone knows how to fix https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/10231
please help to unblock the release.

Or if you think that https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/10231 should not
be a release blocker, please add your comments.

For now, I will delay the release of RC2 to wait to see what is the
resolution for #10231

Regards

This depends largely upon your available time and the difficulty of making these changes, but I'd suggest doing an RC2 as soon as the fixes are ready for the new python versions, to ensure folks can test with those, and then do an RC3 as soon as the annotation fix is ready.

Nope, I'm fully in favor. When we're done reviewing, and waiting for CI, reviewers should be able to set auto-merge and walk away.  Thank you for raising the issue!

Hi Adi,

This, and adding Tom to dornkirk/SSH, both sound good to me. I wish we had a more formal process for these various permissions but I think whatever the standard we would set, Tom has exceeded the bar by now.

Thanks.

Hi guys

I'm new to twisted and would appreciate some beginner guidance.

I'm trying to use the "python -m twisted.conch.stdio" command in command
prompt but it does not work and gives the following error:

C:\WINDOWS\system32>python -m twisted.conch
C:\Users\Melanie\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.7_qbz5n2kfra8p0\python.exe:
No module named twisted.conch.*main*; 'twisted.conch' is a package and
cannot be directly executed

*I'm hoping that this will solve the rest of the error messages I'm having.
I want to eventually be ably to run :*

>>> from twisted.names import client
>>> client.getHostByName('www.example.com')
<Deferred at 0xf5c5a8 waiting on Deferred at 0xf5cb90>
>>> _

>>> _

*The aim is to get the deferred responses as shown in previous code, but
all I get is:*

Please help. I'm trying to send this to the twisted mailing group. If I'm

Thanks in advance.

I have enabled auto-merge for twisted/twisted

Let me know if you want to be enabled for other repos.

Message-ID: <E599CE26-C8A4-4A6A-8D92-579C653F9D00@twistedmatrix.com>

Hello Twisted friends,

This is just a friendly reminder that https://twisted.reviews <https://twisted.reviews/> is full to bursting - 34 open reviews right now, some dating back as far as May of last year.  If you've got a few free minutes, can you find a ticket on that list and review the associated PR?  (I recently fixed the report so it's actually in the order you should review them...)  A short review queue is a happy review queue.

Remember also that this isn't for nothing, if you do code reviews on Twisted you get internet points and bragging rights, at https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/ <https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/>.

This isn't just for project members; if you did not already know, the rule is that if you're a project member you can review anything, but if you're an external contributor, you can review submissions by project members (and it's up to them to decide if your review is adequate before acting on it).  Project members (should) have a "*" next to their name in the "submitted by" list.  (If they don't I think someone needs to go manually update a list of strings, feel free to report issues if that's wrong.)

Happy hacking,

-glyph

Hi Melanie!  Welcome to the community. I hope we can get you set up better.

In this example you're doing `python -m twisted.conch`, not `python -m twisted.conch.stdio`, which will not work anywhere.
Unfortunately, the Conch standard-IO library (and therefore the conch terminal client, and twisted.conch.stdio) doesn't work on Windows and never has: https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2157 <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2157>.  However, you may be able to get it up and running with the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which I believe will present a Linux-like interface since as far as the application knows it's running on Linux: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about>

Is the goal here specifically to do this with Conch, or would doing it with Jupyter Notebook (using something like https://twitter.com/glyph/status/1417360623818575876 <https://twitter.com/glyph/status/1417360623818575876> which I found while researching a response to this email!) be sufficient?

Or, for that matter, could you just write a little program?  A sample Python script that runs the reactor is probably easier to set up than a reactor-enabled REPL, particularly on Windows.  (There are various options for a reactor-enabled REPL, it's definitely doable, but it might be a bit rough as a first step; as you're discovering.)

The reason you're getting this with a normal Python interactive interpreter is that the event loop which actually performs the I/O (does the DNS queries, in this case) isn't running at all, so the Deferreds are created, but never resolved.

Hi

Thanks Barry for reporting the issue.

It should be back online.

The twisted-web process was down.
I have started it.

If anyone has the time to deal with it, we *do* have a free subscription donated by the friendly folks over at Sentry; if we set up the integration in all of our services it might lead to the discovery of some interesting bugs.

Let me know if you need credentials or an invite or something.

Hi all,

I just finally got around to installing and testing the new RC with our primary 
Twisted App.  Everything seems to work fine.

I continue to be impressed by what a good job Twisted does with backwards 
compatibility!

Update: I went through the queue and gardened it substantially. There were a bunch of tickets where folks had forgotten to remove the review keyword upon closure, some with malformatted commit messages so they weren't closed (this is very hard to enforce mechanically, but please, use the template in the PR boilerplate), and some with merge conflicts that needed addressing before review.

I also pushed the "update branch" button on a whole lot of PRs so hopefully some CI detritus that made tests fail for spurious reasons will be cleared out, and everything will be reasonably up to date.

We are now down to 17 matches, but this does give me a commanding lead on this month's leaderboard:



I look forward to being dethroned.

Hi

Just a quick update.
The release is on hold as I am waiting for Thomas to check a possible
regression.

I don't know when the results from the investigation will be available.
I hope for the end of today.

Will be back with more details.
Cheers

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted 21.7.0 Final Release Announcement
Message-ID: <CAFycZ9ccyJWhVw+=Wj2_DHU96NOQFEiQHyLC1mB37=4ZfMziOw@mail.gmail.com>

On behalf of the Twisted contributors I announce the final release of
Twisted 21.7.0

This is mostly a bugfix release.

*Python 3.5 is no longer a supported platform.*
*The minimum supported platform is Python 3.6.7.*

The notable features are:

- Python 3.10 beta is now a supported platform and should be ready for the
final 3.10 release.
- twisted.web.template.renderElement() now accepts any IRequest implementer
instead of only twisted.web.server.Request. Add type hints to
twisted.web.template. (#10184)
*-  *Type hinting was added to twisted.internet.defer, making this the
first release  of Twisted where you might reasonably be able to use mypy
without your own custom stub files. (#10017)

The full release notes are available at

    https://github.com/twisted/twisted/releases/tag/twisted-21.7.0

Documentation is available at

    https://docs.twistedmatrix.com/en/stable/

Wheels for the release candidate are available on PyPI

    https://pypi.org/project/Twisted/21.7.0/

    python -m pip install Twisted==21.7.0

Many thanks to everyone who had a part in Twisted - the supporters of the
Twisted Software Foundation, the developers, and all the people testing and
building great things with Twisted!

Enjoy the release!
