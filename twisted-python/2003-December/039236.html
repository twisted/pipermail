Change this to lmx(self) and it works. It's the widget that knows the 
correct place in the current DOM to make changes, not the template node 
that was passed in (node).

A major difficulty with the livepage and view notification architecture 
in woven is object identity -- you must have a reference to a DOM node 
which is actually in the DOM in order for your mutation changes to 
actually show up when the DOM is turned into a string. This is 
partially because woven tries really hard to allow you to re-render 
only those portions of the page that have changed, as you are 
attempting to do here by using notify. Since woven needs to be able to 
rerender portions of the page, it also needs to keep around copies of 
the original DOM -- the &quot;template&quot; DOM -- so it can pass it to your 
function again upon rerendering.

Anyway, Widgets also add an extra level of complexity over the w3c DOM 
in woven. This is the main reason I went with rendering functions, not 
rendering objects, in Nevow. (The render function can of course be a 
method bound to an object).

Neither LivePage nor partial-page rendering are implemented in Nevow 
yet, precisely because they are advanced features that are difficult to 
get right, and I wanted to make sure the basic rendering features were 
correct first. Since Nevow rendering hasn't had any surprising bugs for 
over a month, I think it's time to start implementing LivePage and 
partial-page rendering in Nevow. I'm planning on doing a lot of 
documentation and implementation work around christmastime, when I 
should have more time to focus on it.
