(Jp can be somewhat sarcastic sometimes.)

Note that twisted just won't scale as well as pure C
load-from-filesystem-only webservers, since *every* request is
essentialy &quot;dynamic&quot;, i.e. requires slowish python code to run. That
does not mean twisted is slow, though, for dynamic sites it might run
faster than a apache/php/mysql app if architectured correctly, because
for dynamic apps that throughput (how many bytes you can push out) is
almost never the bottleneck. And twisted.web should be able to saturate
most network connections, even if it's slower at the moment at byte
pushing.
