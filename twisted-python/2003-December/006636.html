Alternatively, have some way to signal to your threads that they should
shutdown cleanly.  I'm assuming your thread does something like:

    while 1:
        nextTask = queue.get()  # queue is a Queue.Queue instance
        process(nextTask)

You could change it to:

    while 1:
        nextTask = queue.get()  # queue is a Queue.Queue instance
        if nextTask is None:
            break
        process(nextTask)

And then all you need to do is make sure you add a None to your threads'
queues when you shutdown, e.g. from stopService.  I've used this method in
the past to shutdown worker threads -- I didn't want them to finish
prematurely, because otherwise there was a risk that the data they were
writing to the DB would get lost.  So I used this sort of explicit
notification, rather than Python's thread.setDaemonic(1).

For reader threads, obviously data loss isn't a problem, so you could just
set those to be daemonic -- although I was creating my threads myself,
rather than using callInThread.  If you use callInThread, do it the way
Itamar suggests: send functions that do their task then exit.  callInThread
maintains a threadpool to service those functions quickly (with a maximum
size to prevent too many running at once).  Otherwise, if you want to do
your own long-running thread, just create it yourself, and you can
setDaemonic on it if appropriate.

-Andrew.
