<PRE>Hi all,

I just wanted to thank the Twisted developers for making such a cool 
piece of software.  We received a question from a customer late Friday 
afternoon about remotely viewing data from their data acquisition 
system.  There are short-term options that involve using their existing 
fat clients over a VPN, communicating with a server via a proprietary 
format, but that's not acceptable long-term (for many reasons), so I 
figured I would try making a web-based demo in Python.

Thanks to Twisted and Python, I was able to start from scratch and put 
together a server to present some of this data via XML-RPC in about 2 or 
3 hours (and that includes looking up a lot of stuff in the 
documentation).  I'm currently using PHP to display the data on a web 
page, but I may eventually use Twisted for that as well.

If I had tried to do this in C/C++, or if even if I'd tried to do this 
in Python without Twisted, I'd probably still be fighting with it for a 
good part of this week.  But now I have a demo put together, it's been 
running for about 7 hours with no problems, and we can go from saying 
&quot;we'll look into that&quot; to &quot;oh, yeah, here's something we put together 
from scratch in our spare time&quot; in less than one business day.

Of course there's a long way to go before this becomes a production 
product, but hopefully this means I will be working with Twisted and 
Python a lot more in the future, and hopefully I'll be able to tell more 
about it as time goes on.  Again, many thanks for such a wonderful piece 
of software.

Happy Monday,
Alan
