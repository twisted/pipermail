Itamar,

on a quick look it seems to work. I noticed it's a bit slow on the display 
(client) side. That may probably be tweaked with the timer setting in the 
WxReactor class. My application actually loads a 1.5 MB wx.Xressource file, 
smaller applications might not have that problem. 

I noted that in my app no labels (wx.StaticText) show up. This can be due to 
the timing issue above, or simply because I only quickly disabled my timer 
solution and put the reactor in. I didn't really do a comprehensive test. 
wxreactor needs the latest RC2 and I'm still using pre 1.1.0 - so I certainly 
get a bunch of depreciation warnings.
Whenever I've got time to switch my app over to 1.1.x I'll do more 
comprehensive testing.
At least it doesn't get stuck when entering a modal dialog or a pulldown menu.
I currently just don't have the time/manpower to pull my application to the 
new API. Maybe it's also not the brightest idea to test with a huge 
application (currently some 10 MB sourcecode)
But it's definitely a good start. I'll try using it on smaller projects that I 
can start off with 1.1.x
But it looks very promising to finally have support out of the box.
I'll also give it a shot on windows.

Suggestion: I'll try to tweak the timer settings in the next days. If that 
shows the desired effect, maybe you can parametrize the settings to allow 
tweaking it to application needs.
