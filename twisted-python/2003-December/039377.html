  PB references are managed by the connection's Broker object, which is
created anew in the factory's buildProtocol method, and the object/reference
cache of which is cleared when connections are lost.

  Having references which can withstand disconnects should be doable
relatively easily - all you need to do is make sure the same Broker objects
get used for all subsequent reconnections.  This may be a little tricky,
since you need to differentiate between new connections and reconnections
(which you can't do easily with PB, because you'll already have a Broker),
but should be entirely possible.

  I'm not sure if there is any reason, other than trickiness factor, that
this isn't implemented directly in twisted.spread.  Perhaps there is a
hidden issue I am unaware of, or maybe it is simply that no one has wanted
it badly enough to write it :)

  Hope this helps,
