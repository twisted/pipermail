The intent, as I understand it, is to forbid any possibility of double-encoding or double-decoding a label, not to forbid the possibility of using labels like the one you mention.

I agree with this reading.

&gt;&gt;<i> I can see why a UI would need to do IDNA-2008 converts and validation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I'm not clear why its of value deep in the guts of twisted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is that this is just an accident of the way that the bytes/characters distinction and the IDNA features were added to Twisted, and is probably a bug.
</I>
+1.

We also have other issues with the Python IDNA library: <A HREF="https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18">https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18">https://github.com/kjd/idna/issues/18</A>&gt; and would generally like to reduce our strictness via whatever mechanisms we can, even for things that genuinely require it (which this does not).

&gt;&gt;<i> Why is this code needed at all in twisted?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If its for a high level API then why isn't it being called at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> edge of the high level API calls?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd argue that resolving URLs is in fact a high level API (from the point of view of the name resoution system) but even so, it seems to me that Twisted is doing the wrong thing here. The format of that label should prevent it from ever being transformed by IDNA, but shouldn't prevent it from being passed through unchanged, since it doesn't contain any codepoints outside of the usual ASCII range.
</I>
Also agreed with all of this.

&gt;&gt;<i> The key idea here is that its human input that will be converted.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But the code is used deep in the _sslverify.py where no human
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> input is entered.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _sslverify has to check whether the information in the server's certificate matches the URL that the user supplied. Certificates can contain Unicode text — at least in the (completely obsolete) CN-as-domain-name situation — so _sslverify probably picked up the requirement for IDNA transformations from that. (I don't remember whether dNSName SANs can contain unicode.)
</I>
Yep.

&gt;<i> What is the patch you decided to add to your version? Where in _sslverify did the problem surface?
</I>
I am also very curious about this :).
