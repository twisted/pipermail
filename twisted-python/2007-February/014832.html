</I>
Two things I should emphasize:

(1)  I do appreciate &quot;the flexibility that is cred&quot; -- even though I do
not intend to use digest auth, I will most likely use other auth methods
(e.g., LDAP) -- but only over an encrypted transport.  Cred's
flexibility and other well designed architectural features are
the main reasons I use Twisted.

(2)  As I mentioned in my last message, I am campaigning against the
use of digest auth here at NASA/GSFC, because when things here need
protection, they need the best protection available, and that is *not*
digest auth.  The consequences for security compromises can be pretty
dire -- e.g.:

   (a) NASA system compromises can be front-page news
       (along with other NASA-related misadventures, as we've seen over
       the past couple days ;)
   (b) government employees are personally liable for the release
       of ITAR data -- if it goes to the wrong people, the NASA
       employee responsible can get federal *prison* time.

So you can see why the illusion of security that digest auth
gives to naive people is not good enough for my apps or for any
serious commercial or government applications.  It might be useful
for free on-line gaming communities, though.  ;)

Cheers,
Steve
