</I>
That's not the sort of problem I'm talking about.  Some reactor APIs will appear to work when called from the wrong thread, so if you forget a @deferred somewhere, your test might seem to work, or hang in a weird place, or produce different error output each time.

&gt;<i>What happens with Trial when you forget to return the Deferred the test
</I>&gt;<i>should wait on?
</I>
Trial doesn't require tests to return Deferreds.  If there is no Deferred, the test completes immediately.

&gt;&gt;<i> All in all it seems like it would be simpler to just use trials'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> TestCase class with nose.  Is there any reason not to?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Given that Trial is a self-contained tool, and given that nose also has
</I>&gt;<i>its own test running and collecting, I simply didn't expect this to work
</I>&gt;<i>or to keep working accross versions of both tools.
</I>
This is definitely a concern, but your current approach doesn't seem any less fragile.

&gt;&gt;<i> Trial doesn't force your code to make use of Twisted, and as Mr. Lange
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has declared previously, it goes to some lengths to be compatible with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stdlib unit tests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Of course, but to use Trial you must install Twisted don't you ?
</I>
&gt;<i>Which is quite a big dependency,
</I>
Is 2 megabytes really too big?

&gt;<i>and Twisted does not yet support being easy_install'ed.
</I>
... and nose doesn't yet support being apt-get installed ;-)

If you'd like to see easy_install support for Twisted, please feel free to contribute support for it; the release manager could probably use some help maintaining setup.py in general.
