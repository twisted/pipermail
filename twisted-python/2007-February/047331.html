Thanks, David, but for my application it isn't useful.  IMNSHO, digest
auth only gives an illusion of good security -- it's encrypted, right? 
But I regard it as a waste of time, and the time that I have to work
on the actual logic of my application is in short supply as it is.

Digest auth was invented in 1993, well before widespread open source
implementation of strong asymmetric key technologies, and digest auth
is a technology that can be broken by determined hackers.  I don't
intend to bother with it -- especially since good transport layer
encryption technology is now quite easy to use.

I prefer to exclude digest auth completely from any of my applications,
as I am campaigning against its use.

&gt;&gt;<i> That wasn't obvious to me from HTTPAuthResource's doc

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, I'm happy now -- thanks, web2 team!

Yes, it would have saved me half a day off-and-on of head-scratching.

&gt;&gt;<i> Death to HTTP digest authentication!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know, I definitely prefer digest authentication[1] to sending
</I>&gt;<i> my password in plaintext[2]
</I>
I use either plaintext basic auth (if the need is only for user
identification, not security) or transport layer asymmetric key
encryption (if the resource needs security).  If it needs security,
it needs real security, and since twisted makes transport layer
asymmetric key encryption (e.g., openssl) quite easy to use, the
only reason I can see for bothering with digest auth is if you
have either some legacy stuff that needs it (which I don't) or
a pointy-haired boss who insists on it (time to look for another
job! ... but one doesn't always have that opportunity, of course).
There might be other use-cases, but I have surrounded them with
a Somebody Else's Problem Field, so they are invisible to me.  ;)

Thanks for all your good work on web2 -- it is appreciated!  :)

Cheers,
Steve
