<PRE>Sorry for what might look like spam, but this job posting for a
Twisted developer came through a friend of mine. If anyone has an
interest in this just respond to me and I'll forward your info along.

I'm quoting here:
&quot;&quot;&quot;
these guys are
the founding team of revr and are building the first true web
syndication platform for video. they have deals with warner and mtv so
far and basically take their videos and generate tons of views for them
using some proprietary technology.

they are looking to make a senior hire with the following credentials.
if you know of anyone in the la or san fran area, i would greatly
appreciate an intro. thanks
