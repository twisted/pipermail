For the moment, except I make a mistake, only credentials which
implements IUsernamePassword are supported by the PBClientFactory.login
method. Then if, for instance, passwords are stored with a SHA hash
method, I can't use it as it is. 

Another case in which the implementation present for the moment does not
permit another credentials to be use: for instance, if the credentials
are based, on an other strategy than the username/password one, I think
it couldn't work too.

May be I misunderstood some important points. And at least a part of
what I've talk just before is possible.

What I would be able to do is to arbitrary choice any credentials, and
at the other side, that any checker which is able to check this
credentials is possible to use (I think it's already O.K. for the
checker part).

I thought at a solution, but I don't really know if it is a good one
(both from a design and security point of view). And in the case I made
a mistake in my comprehension, it would be useless.

May be it's possible to put a kind of &quot;credential remote reference&quot; at
the server side which serve as a proxy for the real credential. 
Form a security point of view it's all right because remote reference
does not transmit data but juste provide remote method calls.
And then, instead of give the _PortalAuthChallenger to the portal as the
credentials, that proxy would be given. The proxy have to implement the
same ICredentials interface to be compatible with the checker. And it
have also to implement a &quot;zero-knowledge password proof&quot; mechanism
(response/challenge) to communicate with the real credentials to
preserve security. 

This solution is based on the existing one. And may be would be more
flexible? Why not a starting point for an effective solution?

Julien.
