</I>&gt;<i> stay compatible with newer kernels?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another approach would be to check in advance if something is listening on
</I>&gt;<i> that particular port, but between the time this check is done and the time
</I>&gt;<i> the server tries to bind, some other process might have grabbed the port.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, the port already being bound is just one of the reasons why
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> startup might fail; I'd prefer to have a way to detect startup failures
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> other reasons as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One question is when exactly &quot;startup&quot; is finished. For my purpose, the

</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> that's a bit messy (where to put it? is the server process allowed to
</I>&gt;<i> write

Yes, I've encountered this problem before.  And yes, I initially did the
same thing as you, by waiting a hardcoded time.  But eventually I got tired
of this race condition, and that it doesn't detect when the server failed to
start.  What I'm doing right now for my non-unit functional testing is
running a bash script which:

- make sure twistd isn't running using ps:  ps aux | grep twistd | grep -v
grep
- start up the app in non-daemon mode, send its output to the console and to
a file:
     twistd -noy my-app.tac | tee server.log &amp;
- poll the server.log by grep'ing for a string I print from my app when the
app is completely started
- launch the tests against the running server (I think I'm using mechanize
right now for web client library)

This works for me in my development environment, on Linux.

Cheers,
Christian
