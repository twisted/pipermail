So does this.  Why isn't it cool for the parent process to drop the connection?

Message-ID: <f44750160604020300r4a16b1f6s1edd7e7ad1fb78c3@mail.gmail.com>

hi all!
  i'm trying to develop a COm server application with wxpython, but i have
many thread problems (the GUI can't be in the same thread of the COM server
and also if i do it I have serious cleanup problems...). Can twisted help me
in maintain my GUI in a separate thread and talking to the COM server
instance?

thanks a lot,

"range(0, 1, 2)" is a particularly obscure way to say "[0]".  I'm guessing
there's no test coverage for reading binary data from stdout or stderr of
subprocesses?

Alas, this won't do anything resembling correct in a Twisted application.

I tried to come up with an answer to this question earlier today, but failed: perhaps the OP can ask a more specific or detailed one which will be easier to answer correctly.

I don't know where to begin. Could you pretend that nobody on this list  
knows what COM is and ask your question again?

What are you using Twisted for now?
What else are you hoping Twisted can help you with?
What exactly are the limitation you are dealing with?

Hmm.  As a matter of fact, the test which covers stdin should also cover stdout.  I'm not sure why that wasn't failing.  I meant [0, 1, 2] or range(0, 3).

I would fix it, but this weekend is pretty much over, and my next 3 weekends are spoken for.  Does somebody want to take over maintainership of this area?  I only started working on it because I wanted to be able to work on Divmod code at the same time as playing video games in Windows.

Not really, No. I think you should have waited for the OP to ask a better  
question as JP suggested. The quality of questions on this mailing list  
has been very poor lately. Anyway, onwards...

To shut down a Service cleanly, you call stopService() on it.

If you want your service to have its stopService method called when  
Twisted shuts down, then
that service should be registered correctly. If you aren't using twistd  
then see
twisted.application.app.startApplication

>>> An example test.tac file:

 from twisted.application import service

class MyService(service.Service):
     def stopService(self):
         print "Stopping my service!"
         service.Service.stopService(self)

application = service.Application("My Twisted App")
myService = MyService()
myService.setName("My Service")
myService.setServiceParent(application)

 from twisted.internet import reactor
reactor.callLater(2, reactor.stop)

<<< End test.tac

If you run the .tac file with "twistd -noy test.tac", after 2 seconds,
you will see "Stopping my service!" printed.

Either use twistd with a .tac, as someone else suggested, or:

reactor.addSystemEventTrigger('before', 'shutdown', myservice.stopService)

If stopService returns a Deferred this will delay shutdown until
Deferred returned from stopService is triggered.

We're considering using a process inspired by yours at Allmydata, but we don't
call it "branch-based", since the word "branch" means something else in our
workflow.  Also we use darcs instead of SVN, and there is no particular sense
in which "branches" are important to our version of this process.

Okay.

Message-ID: <d27002d90604031015m231e291fi7e38095a96e217f1@mail.gmail.com>

pb logs failures with an error of type pb.Error if these failures are
returned by remotely-invoked methods; however, if these methods raise the
same Error, it is not logged.

Is this difference intentional or accidental?

Shouldn't this difference be removed?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <d27002d90604031105x591bb47fw6e5d3a82b148e518@mail.gmail.com>

in pb.Broker._sendError, if fail is a Failure with a jellyable value, then
the value, rather than the failure, is serialized.

When this value reaches the other side, it is wrapped in a failure. But all
the other information in the remote Failure is lost.

This seems inconsistent to me, and indeed has caused me a bug. If a method
returns a CopyableFailure that has a Jellyable value, then there's no
apparent reason for the information in the failure not to be sent - it
doesn't make sense to me that whether or not the value is Jellyable
determines whether or not the Failure's fields get sent.

I can work around this, but I thought maybe this should be changed in pb.

comments?

It would appear that your server has two active interfaces with
different IPs on the same network. You wouldn't happen to be running
Solaris and IPMP by any chance, would you? Could we possibly see the
output from ifconfig -a?

Twisted contains an IMAP4 server protocol implementation.  It does not contain 
a complete IMAP4 server.  For this, you need a storage mechanism; the complexity 
of IMAP4 places this beyond the current practical scope of Twisted.

"mktap mail --help" should get you started in the right direction for creating a 
POP3 or SMTP server.

Divmod, Inc., my employer, contributed the protocol implementation to Twisted 
while developing a complete IMAP4 server, Quotient.  IMAP4 isn't the focal point 
of the current version of Quotient, but it is likely support will reappear in 
some not-too-distant version.

How are you setting up your UDP communication? Are you using reactor.listenUDP or .connectUDP? Can you provide a minimal code example?

I don't know about windows, but there is an 'interface' optional arg to both those functions that might be useful.

You need to listen separately on each IP address. Unfortunately  
neither twisted nor python has an API for enumerating all the  
addresses of a host, so you'll have to configure them  manually.

Hmm. I've encountered this kind of issue under Solaris with IPMP in that
if you have more than one active interface on a given network, you can't
easily predict which IP address the OS will choose for outbound packets.
I'm not familiar with the Windows selection algorithm.

Is the SNMP program on the Windows box yours or under your control? Or
are you writing something that does an SNMP GET to this windows box? If
it's your program, have a look at the 'interface' option that Stephen
mentioned. Otherwise it becomes a non-twisted issue around the interface
configuration on the Windows box. You want to be able to set the box up
so that it always sends packets out with a known source IP, or have the
receiving program identify responses in an IP address independant way.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] UDP answer from different IP
Message-ID: <E1FRPBJ-0001Bm-00@pyramid.twistedmatrix.com>

I would like to clarify the situation and describe my current work-around:

My twisted application is on client machine A. It sends  SNMP requests to server machine B.

         self.proxy = agentproxy.AgentProxy(
            ipAddress, port,            					# here   '130.119.127.196', 6665
            community = community,
            snmpVersion = 'v1',
            protocol = self.port.protocol,
        )
        df = self.proxy.getTable(oids, timeout= 0.5, retryCount=5)

Machine B has two interfaces to the network with IP '130.119.127.196' and '130.119.127.127' . Here runs some arbitrary SNMP Agent.

Twisted on A opens a port (25000 or so) and sends getNext requests.
These requests contain an ID, that is later used to identifiy incoming messages and  relate them to the request.

To do this snmpprotocol.py has a function getRequestKey, that retrieves this ID from protocol elements.

When sending the getNext-message getRequestKey() returns:

(('130.119.127.196', 6665), 782)

This is the key which later should work to identify this request when the answers from B arrive.

But since B uses the other interface to answer, the message that arrives carries:

(('130.119.127.127', 6665), 782) and this key is not known.

I wonder why we need the IP address and port at this point, since the ID (782) is unique to machine A and port 25000 and is sufficient to identify the request to which this incoming message belongs.

I patched in snmpprotocol.py:

	def getRequestKey( self, request, target ):
		"""Get the request key from a request/response"""
		for key in [
			'get_request', 'get_response',
			'get_next_request', 'get_bulk_request',
			'response', 'set_request',
		]:
			try:
				ID = request['pdu'][key]['request_id']
			except KeyError, err:
				pass
			except TypeError, err:
				log.error(
					"""Unexpected TypeError retrieving request key %r: %s""",
					key, log.getException(err),
				)
			else:
#				return target, ID.get()
				return ID.get()
		raise KeyError( """Unable to get a request key id from %s for target %s"""%( request, target))

This worked.
Could this be checked by some expert ? Any problem with this approach ?

Thanks
Wolfgang

Then the SNMP code you're using is wrong. As you have found, it is 
EXTREMELY common for this to happen (the SNMP reply to come from a 
different IP than the request was sent to). Whether it's a wrong thing 
for the router/host to do is irrelevant for practical purposes - lots 
and lots of network equipment, some of it very expensive, does it.

My SNMP code does as you suggest, just uses the port number and ID number.

I can't see if that's the specific right thing to patch since I'm not 
familiar with TwistedSNMP, but as I say I have a python/C-helper SNMP 
stack, and it does exactly as you suggest, so if it works I'd say you've 
fixed it.

You should leave the original function names around here somewhere, in a comment or a doc-string, since they are direct references to the spec which defines these transformations.

"instances that implement"?  This is confusing.  Do you really mean "classes which implement" or "instances which provide"?

This is probably meant to be @type.

Typo here, and the only thing portals do is handle login, so is this really a useful piece of documentation? ;)

Message-ID: <20060407211917.53349.qmail@web30007.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

HTTP 1.1 persistent connection requires replies to be
send by the server in the order requests are received.
At least this is the way I understand the HTTP clients
can associate request/reply send and received thru the
TCP/IP.

I use Twisted twisted.protocols.http for very specific
application. There is a Twisted based HTTP server
which in some cases must reply in different order.

Now, I went thru the http module code and all the
outstanding requests results are steamed into IOString
and later flushed out in the correct order.

Is there any way to disable queuing. I tried to
overriteRequest.queued by passing 0 in to the__init__
but it yields some other problems. I use 1.3 Twisted.


Thanks in advance, A.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Cleanly shutting down Service
In-Reply-To: <1144078575.9211.5.camel@localhost.localdomain>
Message-ID: <E1FS1lW-0003CX-00@pyramid.twistedmatrix.com>

I have two related questions about this.

I have been using

reactor.addSystemEventTrigger('before', 'shutdown',
myservice.beforeStopService) (not using .tac)

In my beforeStopService() function I need to do two things:

1) I have two factories, and two different protocols, that use two different
ports. Both have the same application set as service parent. I would like to
shut down connections on only ONE of the two ports before I proceed with
pre-shutdown procedures. How do I do this?

I am only aware of  
twisted.internet.reactor.disconnectAll()
But that shuts down all connections on BOTH ports.

Here is the simplified structure of my application:

#this connects to another server, I need this to stay open during
pre-shutdown
server_connector = ConnectorFactory()
server_connector.protocol = protocols.IconsToSellersProtocol
server_connector.service = myservice
serv_to_serv = twisted.application.internet.TCPClient(HOST, PORT_1,
server_connector).setServiceParent(application)

#this accepts connections from clients, I need this to close this during
pre-shutdown
client_factory = twisted.internet.protocol.ServerFactory()
client_factory.protocol = protocols.ClientProtocol
client_factory.service = myservice
client_factory.service.sc_protocol = server_connector.protocol
client_serv=twisted.application.internet.TCPServer(PORT_2,
client_factory).setServiceParent(application)

2) This scenario is simliar to 1), except that I want to stop accepting new
connections on PORT_2 in my pre-shutdown procedure, leaving the existent
connections on PORT_2 in ESTABLISHED state intact.

Either use twistd with a .tac, as someone else suggested, or:

reactor.addSystemEventTrigger('before', 'shutdown', myservice.stopService)

If stopService returns a Deferred this will delay shutdown until
Deferred returned from stopService is triggered.

Hello,

I reckon it's about time for another AU sprint.

The likely locations are Sydney or Melbourne, and the likely dates are
any weekend in May, the first weekend of June or the last weekend of
June.

Topics are as yet undecided.  I intend to remove wait() entirely.

I tentatively suggest that the Sprint be:
- In Sydney
- June 24-25
(patches accepted)

Can you make it? Reply today!

cheers,
jml

If it's in Sydney yes, in Melbourne likely not (for entirely slefish
reasons involving throwing perfectly good money that could be spend on
sprinting at scuba diving).

If it's in Sydney I suggest going through Bob Kummerfeld as per post #4

Subject: [Twisted-Python] marking 3 problem tests on Windows 'todo'
In-Reply-To: 0
Message-ID: <20060410023926.22481.1056588948.divmod.quotient.11928@ohm>

Currently there are 3 tests which are causing problems on the select reactor on win32, as detailed by this build report: 

http://twistedmatrix.com/buildbot/win32-select/builds/445/step-default/2

I think they should all be marked 'todo'.  Although ideally all the functionality these tests cover should be supported on Windows, the tests themselves are somewhat suspect, and marking them as 'todo' conditionally for the platform would turn the Windows buildbot green, allowing us to notice much more quickly when other, more serious things have gone wrong.

I am writing out a big rationale here becuase normally .todo'ing tests which are passing is a big no-no, and I think that this is something of a special case due to the long period of neglect for the platform involved.

The test in question are:

 * twisted.pb.test.test_negotiate.CrossfireReverse.test1

I've talked to brian about this test being todo'd because it is intermittently failing on _all_ platforms; windows just seems to have a far greater chance of failing.

 * twisted.test.test_udp.MulticastTestCase.testJoinFailure

I'm not really sure what is going on here.  Some nuance of error reporting in Python?  127.0.0.1 _is_ considered a multicast address on Windows?  This seems like it should be TODO'd conditionally, and there should be a ticket to conclusively diagnose it.

 * twisted.web2.test.test_http.SSLServerTest.testLingeringClose

Buffering 'lo' on Windows is weird.  I don't think that there is a proper way to fix this; IMHO the test is slightly buggy.  It's worth noting that the thing that's blowing up is a direct call to openssl's send(), _not_ a Twisted API.

While I think that this test is sort of suspicious, and it should figure out a way to be more lenient to its subprocess, I think that it can be todo'd for win32 since the behavior being tested isn't platform dependent, only the client APIs involved.  I believe that the ticket here should use Twisted in the subprocess so that if there is a portability issue with buffering, we can properly abstract it.

 * twisted.test.test_ssl.ConnectionLostTestCase.testFailedVerify

This is reporting the wrong error, but it is correctly dropping the connection.  There is a small security risk here, which bothers me, but there may be no way to expose the proper information without fixing bugs in openssl.  Considering that this passes on UNIX I believe it should also be conditionally marked on Windows.  The ticket here is simply to get the test to pass, since I think the test itself is OK in this circumstance.


In conclusion: one of these tests should be todo'd on all platforms, the rest should be todo'd conditionally if isWindows().  Any objections?

Hmmm.  I don't see any changes related to wait() in these hunks. ;)

While it doesn't appear that this change *introduced* a new race condition, it does seem as though it has jostled things so as to cause an existing one to start going the wrong way.

This seems to be a pretty common one in the test suite, so everyone pay attention.

Just because one side of a TCP connection has had its connection-established-successfully callback fired (ie, buildProtocol on the Factory) does not mean that both sides of the TCP connection have had this callback fired.  Quite often, in fact, this is not the case (particularly on platforms you forgot to run the unit tests on ;).

This ftp setUp needs to be made to wait for both the server and the client to become connected before proceeding.  The failure to do so can be seen as a new failing test on the reactors buildslave in the Qt step.

(Of course, the Qt step was already red, because a previous branch uncovered still another race condition.)

Please revert the branch or fix the race post-haste.  If someone would take a look at the failing tcp half-close test on that reactor, I would appreciate it, otherwise I'll try to get to it sometime in the next couple days.

Jean-Paul

This was my bad (I did the ftp parts of this branch) -- I bumped into the bug in
the first hunk while updating test_ftp, and improved the nearby "Blah" while I
was at it :)

Jonathan and I both came up with essentially the same fix for this.  He's just
committed mine to the trunk in r16583.

Thanks for spotting this.

No idea about the half-close test, though...

Subject: [Twisted-Python] PB v XMLRPC v CORBA v SOAP
Message-ID: <443A335C.6000204@BrendanSimon.com>

I have the following application in mind.
    1. Using a Configuration Management System that only runs on UNIX.
    2. Write an application for Windows to remotely connect to the UNIX 
host and perform commands.
    3. Optionally add a GUI (wxPython) to the application.

The CMS has a command to output XML of parts of its internal database 
which will make it easy to display the info in a client app :)  For me 
the question is how do I get the info to/from the CMS on a remote 
server.  I think writing a small server app to interpret my requests and 
relay the XML output to the client is the answer.

I want to use SSH which is how I got onto Twisted (Conch) though I do 
realise that Paramiko is available too.  I also want to make use of rsync.

Reading some Python books, suggested  technologies are Twisted's 
Perspective Broker, XMLRPC, CORBA and also SOAP is mentioned.

CORBA seems like overkill for my simple server.
SOAP I don't know enough about yet.
XMLRPC seems very appropriate.
PB seems easy enough too.

One big question for me is portability, such that other clients written 
in other languages could access the same data.  I'm thinking that all 
technologies would have this property _except_ for PB.  Is that 
correct?  i.e. could a C, perl or ruby application access my server if 
the server was written using Twisted PB ???

If not would anyone recommend SOAP or XMLRPC instead??

Also, it would be nice if I could use any transport mechanism to send 
the commands.  eg. http, https, ssh, rsh.  Can Twisted be used to 
provide such a generic transport mechanism?  If not would, SOAP or 
XMLRPC be better choices, or is the question of transport irrelevant.

I was thinking of creating my own XML files to request information from 
my server.  Is this the way to go, or am I recreating the wheel?

Thanks,
Brendan.

PB support outside of Python is pretty minimal. I believe there may be a
Java implementation still floating around somewhere, but I'm not sure
how up to date it is, or whether it is even still functional.

I would recommend transferring plain custom XML documents over HTTP,
rather than introducing an extra layer of pain with SOAP or XML-RPC.

I believe SOAP and XML-RPC are only defined over HTTP (including https,
because that's more or less an extra layer underneath it). I'm not sure
there's any value in transmitting SOAP/XML-RPC XML documents over
something like ssh.

I was exactly in the same situation last month :-)

My thoughts:

CORBA ist quite nice, wide spreaded, but more work to implement.

PB ist quite nice, at least twisted only spreaded, but easy to implement.

XML-RPC is included with Python. SOAP is much better the way data types and other things are handled, but not part of Python. Both are easy to use. Twisted favour is SOAPpy and that is build the (pythonic) way like "xmlrpclib".

I use both, but I built the services and the clients that way, that I can change between XML-RPC and SOAP. I need XML-RPC, because one service is located on a Windows 98 machine and I want to reduce complexity out there :-)

For a more formal approach to "XML documents over HTTP" doing in a sane 
fashion what SOAP/XML-RPC wants to achieve:

With Twisted you can easily roll your own RESTive interface.

Message-ID: <d06a5cd30604100547y49455c66v6b6b589fdc267501@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I've recently merged a branch that removes twisted.trial.util.wait
along with all uses of wait() from our tests (paypal details below
;)). Thought it might be a good time to let people know what I'm
thinking with Trial. (By the way, thanks very much to everyone who
helped with that branch.)

There are four major changes / refactorings that I am planning on seeing done:

1. Become a real Twisted application
(http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TrialDevNotes)
Essentially, make Trial's TestSuite expect tests to return Deferreds. 
More at the reference.

2. Trial Reactor (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/1334)
Jp has indicated that this is the best way for Trial to do cleanup
after each test.

3. Log Sanity (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/1409)
Rather than using log._startKeepingErrors or whatever it is called,
use a log observer to keep logged errors and report them as errors
when the test is done.  Provide APIs for altering the list of errors
that have been logged in the test.

4. Split up TestCase
Ideally, I'd like to split out the special case stuff in TestCase that
handles TestCase subclasses that use setUpClass.

I'm intending to work on 1 at the sprint. However, I think we need to
remove the remaining reactor.iterate calls for it to work.

All of these changes involve non-trivial refactoring and should make
Trial less bad.  Once they are made, my role as maintainer will
(hopefully!) slip into fixing bugs, improving docs and adding features
that I'm excited about.

How you can help:
- Money doesn't help so much. If you want, you can buy me curry. Or a
gym membership, to work off all that curry. Paypal is jml at mumak.net.
There are probably better ways you could help Twisted with your money.
- Pairing helps a lot. Come to Tassie.
- Remove calls to reactor.iterate()
- Help me do 2.

cheers,
jml

I'm just getting started with Twisted, and I'm particularly interested

it's been helpful, but it seems to include a lot of functionality 
(handling chat-room requests, change of status of buddies, etc.) and I'm

I don't believe that there is.  It strikes me that it is a documentation bug, either that there isn't such a document, or that it is hard to find.  Someone want to correct me before I file it?

It seems that the 127.*.*.* range is considered a valid multicast

(and no documentation or mention of it online). Other addresses do
properly fail.

More seriously, REST and SOAP/XML-RPC really are different beasts; REST
is about "state transfer", SOAP and XML-RPC are mainly about RPC-style
semantics. Of course, SOAP also has a "document style" form in which you
embed a custom XML document in a wad of pointless SOAP wrapping, which
confuses things.

Unfortunately, in my experience, the most popular choice is also the
most brain-damaged: an RPC-style SOAP interface with a single method
containing a single string parameter (well, maybe a username and
password too; basic auth must be too hard to understand) that contains a
custom XML document...

(If you hadn't guessed, I'm just a little bitter about all this *g*)

> With Twisted you can easily roll your own RESTive interface.

Is there another private range that properly fails?  If so, would you mind creating a ticket for this...? :)

Moe,

I've been trying to use your oscardemo.minimal.py, but it doesn't seem 
to work for me -- I launch it, and it asks for my AIM username & 
password, but after I provide them I don't see my AIM user show up on my 
buddy list (I'm logged in via IM client as another user, to test the 
script).  When I run oscardemo.py, though, it connects fine.

Is there something I have to do to oscardemo.minimal.py before it's 
runnable?  Or am I misunderstanding the way Words works (i.e. it is 
connected, but you need to do something more to have the bot show up on 
people's buddy lists)?

Message-ID: <fa8579a40604120030q19b3d377r152d1af9164ae0d5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a question about how Exceptions are handled by PB.

I am using Twisted to expose a python object (wrapped into a Twisted
Service) over a couple of network protocols (PB and XML-RPC).  I am
using interfaces/components/adapters to adapt my service into entities
that each protocol can use:

class IPerspectiveFunction(Interface):

    def remote_function(self, x):

class PerspectiveFunctionFromService(pb.Root):

    implements(IPerspectiveFunction)

    def __init__(self, service):
        self.service = service

    def remote_function(self, x):
        return self.service.function(x)     # The service returns a Deferred

self.service.function returns a Deferred, whose errbacks are fired
when an Exception is raised in self.service.function.

Here is my dilemma:

- The code in self.service.function that raises exceptions is in
another library that doesn't know about Twisted.  Thus the exceptions
are not sublcasses of pb.Error.

- Even if I did have control over these exceptions, I wouldn't want to
subclass pb.Error as I need to propagate the errors out to other (not
PB) protocols.

- I would like to detect certain types of exceptions (maybe using
trap()) and convert them to instances of pb.Error (or a subclass) so I
can send them over the line using PB.

The following almost works:

    def remote_function(self, x):
        d = self.service.function(x)     # The service returns a Deferred
        def transformFailure(f):
            return failure.Failure(pb.Error(f.printTraceback()))
        d.addErrback(transformFailure)
        return d

The other side gets the Error just fine, but the PB server still
prints the traceback and says "Peer will receive following PB
traceback:"  Why does PB handle it this way, when the Failure instance
that PB gets contains a pb.Error exception?

Any thoughts on how to transform general Failure instances to ones
that can be handled in a clean way by PB?  I guess there is amore
general question of how to transform Failure instances into things
that can be handled by various network protocols (such as XML-RPC or
even HTTP)

Thanks in advance.

How does this work if currently a project chooses a specific reactor
because that's what the tests need ?

For example, some of our UI unit tests use the gtk2reactor/glib2reactor
because otherwise they can't run.  Same for some of our GStreamer-using
tests, which need a glib main loop.

Maybe whatever trial needs can be implemented as an IReactorIface or a
mixin instead ?

If some of your tests are reliant on one reactor, and some of them on
another, then you can't run them both in the same process even now. You will
have to specify the reactor globally, just as always.


Oh, now I think I know what you mean: "Is the Trial reactor only compatible
with the select reactor?"? As I understand it, the idea is to make it a
wrapper around whatever other reactor you globally choose.

Message-ID: <443D6BE5.1020908@ac-montpellier.fr>


I have no answer with a search request,

The search result in ldap directory server logs shows me  why I have no

With twisted 2.2
python /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ldaptor/ldapfilter.py "(uid=toto)"
LDAPFilter_equalityMatch(attributeDesc=LDAPAttributeDescription(value='uid'), 
assertionValue=LDAPAssertionValue(value=LDAPFilter_substrings_final(value=LDAPFilter_substrings_initial(value='toto'))))

With twisted 1.3 I have not the same result

LDAPFilter_equalityMatch(attributeDesc=LDAPAttributeDescription(value='uid'),

The same code works with  twisted 1.3
Any ideas to deal with that ?

I'm not sure what Cooperate actually does but if you just want to put a
deferredGenerator to sleep for some period of time then something like
this (untested) should work:

    seconds = 5
    d = defer.Deferred()
    reactor.callLater(seconds, lambda: d.callback(None))
    d = defer.waitForDeferred(d)
    yield d
    d.getResult()

That's ugly, but pulling the first 3 or 4 lines of that into a function
would tidy it up a lot.

Hi.

I would like to have a function be called at the very end of the reactor
lifetime.

I have tried with the statement in the subject, where self.logout sends
a packet via UDP (self is an instance of a class derived from
DatagramProtocol).

But this seems to be not allowed.
I obtain:

This means, in short, that in a shutdown event I can't use the reactor?

The docstring should actually read:

Services or the underlying APIs they rely on (addSystemEventTrigger) are the correct way to go about this.

You can, and many applications do.  Perhaps you have found a bug, or perhaps you are using system event triggers improperly.  Could you post a minimal, complete example which will reproduce this behavior?

Ok, thanks.
But why the docstring don't say this or, better, why do not remove it
from the interface?


There are some other cases of this?

Sure!
My system is Windows XP SP2, Python 2.4.3, Twisted 2.2.0


##########
import sys

from twisted.python import log

from twisted.internet.protocol import DatagramProtocol
from twisted.internet import defer, reactor


class Server(DatagramProtocol):
    def datagramReceived(self, data, addr):
        print "server: received from %s:%d" % addr, data
        self.transport.write("LOGGED OUT", addr)


class Client(DatagramProtocol):
    def __init__(self):
        self.deferred = defer.Deferred()

    def startProtocol(self):
        self.transport.connect("127.0.0.1", 9000)

        reactor.addSystemEventTrigger("before", "shutdown", self.logout)

    def connectionRefused(self):
        print "unable to connect"

    def datagramReceived(self, data, addr):
        print "client: received from %s:%d" % addr, data
        self.deferred.callback(data)

    def logout(self):
        self.transport.write("LOGOUT")

        return self.deferred



reactor.listenUDP(9000, Server())
reactor.listenUDP(0, Client())

reactor.callLater(2, reactor.stop)

log.startLogging(sys.stdout)
reactor.run()

#############



The problem seems to be with the response.
There are no problems if logout does not return a deferred (but in this
case the client does not sees the LOGGED OUT response).


Is this an improper use of system event triggers?

Message-ID: <6fb6dbfe0604141556w105845d5w4f77782847cd0663@mail.gmail.com>

I've been using twisted for a couple of years, and am re-writing my
application yet-again to make it even more twisty, so I'm trying to use the
persistence mechanisms that come from services and applications, and I have
hit a snag.

I've conformed my application to the details of the tutorial in the docs
(and I see the demonstrated method of making a 'plugin' is deprecated, and I
get that message after registering my app and running mktap).

First question:
The deprecation warning tells me to look in twisted.plugin... but I don't
see much in the way of docs in there. Where can I learn what I should do?

Second question:
Even though I'm using a fresh Twisted 2.2, installed from the tarball, I
don't have any manpages... not for mktap or twistd, so the docs tell me to
look in the manpage, but I can't (I'm on Ubuntu Breezy, FWIW). I see the man
files themselves in my twisted source distribution, but they don't appear to
be installed when I install twisted.

Third question:
I'm able to make a .tap file, run it, and send it ^C to shut it down. I get
the [app]-shutdown.tap file, but when I try to run that file with 'twistd -f
wrangler-shutdown.tap' I get a problem with the re-building of my objects.
There's an attribute error, from one of the classes that's a part of my
application.

Do I have to write my application in some way to get it to persist and
unpersist properly? There's nothing in my app that isn't pickle-able... it's
just instances and dictionaries, nothing like open files or database
connections.

Thanks!

Hi,

I installed Twisted_NoDocs-2.1.0.win32-py2.4.exe. The installer seems to
have put a couple of broken shortcuts on my start menu pointing to a

C:\Python24\lib\site-packages\TwistedDocs\howto\index.xhtml

The real question though is: where can I download the HTML documentation for

I have started to use deferredGenerator:


from twisted.internet import defer, reactor


def waitFor(seconds):

    """

    d = defer.Deferred()

    return defer.waitForDeferred(d)


@defer.deferredGenerator

    d = defer.waitForDeferred(defer.succeed(1))
    yield d

    d = defer.waitForDeferred(defer.fail(Exception("error 1")))
    yield d

#    raise Exception("error 2")

    yield waitFor(3)

    d = defer.waitForDeferred(defer.succeed(2))
    yield d



def callback(result=None):
    print result


def errback(reason):
    print reason


g = generator()
g.addCallbacks(callback, errback)
reactor.run()



The "problem" is that my errback is never called.
Is this a limitation of the deferred Generators?

You want to getResult() the result from waitFor().



    d = defer.waitForDeferred(defer.succeed(2))

    yield d


You want to getResult() the result from waitForDeferred.

getResult() is the thing that (either returns a result or) raises any
exceptions that a Deferred has failed with, so it's important to always call
it.

Message-ID: <9B810C2D-D6FD-45F1-ABB4-E67426F635AC@bubblehouse.org>

hey all...

just dropping a line to see if any of you have noticed a strange  
buglet that i've seen on debian a number of times.

basically, after installing twisted (SVN trunk, not a package), when  
i use apt for various other things, i'll get this error:

[jupiter:~/WebServer/jupiter.bubblehouse.org] phil% sudo apt-get  
install trac
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done

     ???
     ^

this isn't a big deal, because i can just go in and edit the file,  
removing what appears to be simply three question-marks, but i  
thought this was pretty strange. it's doesn't seem to be in the  
original source in SVN, and i've noticed this occurring on both  
Debian and Ubuntu, on various servers.

it obviously doesn't seem like a Twisted problem, but I can't think  
of what could be happening here...I've seen this on well-travelled  
installations like my server, as well as on freshly-installed  
machines at work.

just wondering if anyone else has encountered this...

It _is_ in the original source in SVN, and that file appears to be unused.
It was committed by exarkun in revision 16374 with the commit message
"mumble". I guess it should be removed, unless it *is* serving some
purpose...

Actually, someone should finish it, since there is otherwise no test coverage of halfclose stdio.

I don't have any insight on your particular problems, but the wisdom of the 
list seems to be that the automatic persistence features are not intended for 
production-grade applications, but rather for debugging and development.  
Most authors I'd trust have stated that you're better off to save your state 
yourself on shutdown rather than rely upon the app-shutdown.tap turds.

There has also been debate about whether or not mktap plugins are even a good 
idea at all for new applications.  At any rate, I don't think it receives the 
same attention from the core developers that it once did.  The moral seems to 
be that just because something is provided by Twisted does not mean it's a 
best practice.

Mike.

Ah.  I don't think there is one as of yet. Although if you check out the
subversion repository, most (if not all) of it appears to be in the docs
directory.

It doesn't look like any useful code lives in that file, though - wouldn't it be a better idea to remove it and file a ticket?

Hmm.  This is unfortunate, but since it's unlikely to change soon (many external projects ended up picking up and using bits of Twisted that we ultimately decided are bad ideas) we should probably start documenting "accepted best practices" somewhere.

I suggest a wiki page, linked from the front page, since the idea of "best practice" is an ongoing discussion with some disagreement and some consensus -- probably more appropriate for the wiki format than anything else we are currently using wiki for.

As of r16628, 'trial twisted' on a stock win32 twisted installation will actually succeed and give you a PASSED at the end of it.

I went to a lot of trouble to get things into this state, so I would appreciate it if everyone could keep it this way.

More accurately: I will personally revert any changes that cause real failures on win32.  I say "real" failures because (as the buildbot history immediately following this commit amply shows) the win32 buildbot itself seems kind of flaky; some of this may have to do with the slave itself running a released version of Twisted, I'm not sure.  Any other buildbot enforcers / reviewers should be aware that it fails intermittently and give it a few chances to build to make sure the failure is legitimate, especially if the failure is a timeout or a buildbot disconnect.

Finally, I'd like to thank everyone who provided me with help, reviews, commentary, and test fixes to get to this state, especially jerub, exarkun, foom, and jml.

Now, let's get a new release out so we can upgrade that buildbot :).

Message-ID: <e89aa560604160358h469022fbj5cb4b7934807f37d@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I need to implement a web server with authentication and SSL (so I
guess basic authentication is good enough) and to be able to upload
big files to the server.

Is web2 ready for that (I assume twisted.web is not good for that), if
not is there a new version coming soon (release or CVS head) or can I
add this stuff my self?

thanks

Why do you assume that?

Followups to twisted-web at twistedmatrix.com, please.

No.  As its only current use-case is documenting twisted, I've been
asking people to file tickets in tm.com's trac and after a few piled
up in the website component, exarkun added a pydoctor component.

Does this bother you somehow?

That makes sense.

Nope.  Just seems like yet another indication that it should really be lore --api ;-)  Or rather, lore, like trial, should be able to take a file (HTML or Python) or module name.

It doesn't and can't really work like that though, pydoctor really
needs to work on a whole system/package at a time.

Thanks for the reply.

So, if the docs tell us that this way is the way to use twisted, and they're
wrong, where do we go to learn how to use twisted?

The docs are quite clear about using application objects and making your
code into a twisted 'plugin' rather than simply poking at the reactor (as in
some of the quick-n-dirty tutorials).

I can certainly write my own persistence code, but I'm a little worried that
more of the "best practices" presented by the docs are wrong. Should I still
use twistd? Should I use the application object? Etc.

Shorter (and somewhat snippier): how do we use twisted in our projects, if
the docs are wrong?

I know that you personally aren't responsible to answer this question; I'm
hoping some others might pipe in and point me to some other docs or other
tutorials.

Thanks.

Looks like someone's slightly ahead of or behind you.  The mktap howto at:

  http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/mktap.html

now reads:

  This document does not describe current Twisted best practice. The progress
  of this document is currently being tracked in issue 1139.

The docs also suggest:

  The majority of users will use the .tac Python configuration files without
  needing to use the mktap serialization.

This is certainly my preferred method, and I think that of most developers.  I 
believe mktap was merely an attempt to expose the same functionality with 
higher-level tools.  But take it with a grain of salt; I'm far, far from the 
inner circle.  I'm just regurgitating lore I've picked up from this list to 
help conserve the attention of the wizards.

> So, if the docs tell us that this way is the way to use twisted, and

Never hurts to ask the list, just as you've done.  I think it's likely your 
questions have already resulted in attempts to improve the situation.

Mike.

Please point us at the docs that are wrong (hopefully in the bug tracker),
and give them the "documentation" keyword.

According to that page:
http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/mktap.html

It's already in the tracker (1139). When I click through, I don't end up
there, but those links have never worked for me. I always get kicked back to
the menu.

It's also hard for us users of the libraries to know how to mark bugs for
things like "this isn't the right way to use twisted" if we don't know what
the right way is.

I like Mike's suggestion, though; to stick with .tac and ditch the
persistence for now.

There is a typo in the URL, it's actually:

  http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/1139

(Typo has been noted in the ticket.)

Absolutely - you are suggesting that the parity is even greater than I am.  'trial twisted' ~= 'lore twisted'.  Or perhaps 'lore zope.interface twisted <something that means the stdlib too>'

One really nice thing that lore could do is look for API references in "howto" documentation (man, that stuff needs a better name) and generate the API documentation concurrently so that it can print warnings if such APIs don't exist.  Of course, by no means impossible if they were separate projects.  Pydoctor generates actually parseable output, as opposed to the crap soup of HTML that comes out of epydoc.

Still, it would be super nice if there could be a single, integrated step for building the whole book in HTML and PDF form, then packaging the API docs into an indexed, annotated appendix, included within the LaTeX document, for example.  That sort of thing seems like it'd be hard to pull off without the code being closely related, however, I guess lore could always just import pydoctor (assuming no pydoctor=>twisted dependency).

It's not actually a typo, it's a broken redirect,
http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/ redirects unconditionally to
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/report which breaks links to bugs all over
the place, including mailing list archives.  There is a patch attached
to ticket #1517 which fixes this, but I don't know what the status of
that patch is in regards to our website maintainer.

Yep.  Really good question/answer threads are often useful enough to be turned into documentation themselves.  Several of the better Twisted documents, if I recall correctly, were created in just this way.  It always seems easier to reply to an email than to sit down and design a document from scratch.

It seems to me that pydoctor should remain separate -- I suspect it  
would be more useful for other projects if it was not integrated with  
lore.

At the very least, this sort of thing seems to be the sort of thing
that should get a detailed answer added to the FAQ.

Apparently you've come to the right place. :-)

I have to apologize for that; .tap plugins, in particular, are my fault.  Sometimes, a system will be written, documented, people will use it for a while, and it will turn out that the supposed benefits of putting up with the pain of a plugin interface or a layer of indirection are actually not worthwhile.  There is chaos for a while as everyone tries to figure out what the best way to solve the problem that the interface originally wanted to solve is.  I wish Twisted didn't have this problem, but it's hardly unique.  The difference is, we admit we have the problem, let our users know we are reconsidering our solution, and attempt to discover the correct way :-).

(For a counterexample, see the web stuff in J2EE.  The XML addicts who designed it refused to admit they were wrong or that the user community was having trouble with the mountains of configuration required, and now the "right" way to use J2EE for Web seems to be ditching it in favor of Ruby on Rails...)

Right now the appropriate thing to do is use a .tac file.  Some of what the documentation says is in fact correct: you still shouldn't poke at the reactor directly: just create the Application object (as documented in those howtos) in a .tac configuration file rather than an axiom plugin.

One of the major enhancements we need to make (this will probably be seen in a Twisted 3.0 release) is to make a publicly-supported version of twisted.scripts.twistd.ServerOptions.  If you are uncomfortable reading grotty platform-specific code and getting into spirited arguments on this mailing list about broken compatibility from release to release, that is not yet the class for you.  Eventually we will provide a nice way to make a twistd-like command-line program (and hopefully also a similar GUI-friendly equivalent) that adds additional arguments and startup logic of your choosing.  However, some projects written by Twisted core team members are already abusing the private ServerOptions interface to provide this same effect.

One such project is something that I wrote, Divmod Axiom ( http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodAxiom ).  Axiom abuses this internal interface to implement a rather nice mechanism that actually accomplishes what .tap plugins set out to do.  Axiom is an object database with native support for the Twisted programming model.  The feature I am talking about specifically here though, is a nifty command-line tool called 'axiomatic'.  Axiomatic provides a plugin architecture, like tap plugins, which perform manipulations on a database, and a "start" sub-command, which allows you to do things like this:

     % axiomatic -d mymantissa.axiom mantissa
     Enter Divmod? Mantissa? password for 'admin at localhost':
     Confirm Divmod? Mantissa? password for 'admin at localhost':
     % axiomatic -d mymantissa.axiom start -n

The first command would be roughly equivalent to a hypothetical mktap plugin:

    % mktap -a mymantissa.tap mantissa
    % twistd -nf mymantissa.tap

The difference is that Axiom is a real object database, based around SQLite, with support for managed transactions, schema evolution, persistent timed events, and more.  You can therefore put a reasonable amount of real data into it in addition to your configuration.

>I can certainly write my own persistence code, but I'm a little worried that
>more of the "best practices" presented by the docs are wrong. Should I still
>use twistd? Should I use the application object? Etc.

Yes, use twistd.  Yes, use the application object.  You *can* even write mktap plugins; they will work as described by the documentation.  They're not buggy.  (Okay, they're not *very* buggy.)  It's just that the advertised benefits are not really so great so most people don't use them any more.  The ones that come included with Twisted are handy toys.

A separate issue is that if you have large, complex configurations, storing them in pickle (or any automatic persistence mechanism) is dangerous.  A chance upgrade of any Twisted module which your configuration happens to contain instances from, or the standard library, or any other library which Twisted depends on, or any of your code... well, basically if any Python code on your computer changes at all, you could end up with a configuration that won't load.

This isn't really a Twisted-specific issue, but it is a lesson that many Twisted Matrix Labs developers have learned by way of .tap files.  There is a well-written paper on the dangers of automatic persistence here:

   http://www.erights.org/data/serial/jhu-paper/upgrade.html

If you're intrigued by Axiom after reading this, there's good news and bad news.

The good news:  Axiom can provide all the advantages that tap plugins were supposed to, along with a relatively scalable and powerful general persistence mechanism.  The dangers of upgrading are far reduced from .tap files, because (A) axiom includes very good schema migration support and automatic upgrades between released versions, (B) all attributes are explicit, so there are no "hidden surprises" when you upgrade, and (C) only Item objects in the database need to be upgraded, not every random thing you invoke in your code.

The bad news:  Axiom is heavily in development, nowhere near as stable as Twisted.  The 0.4 release is ancient, in terms of available features, and documentation is mainly being written for the main line of development.  Unfortunately there aren't necessarily upgrades beween every random revision of SVN trunk.  In practice there have been relatively few breakages.

However, it sounds like your needs are relatively lightweight and that you could happily use the 0.4 release of Axiom to deploy a real application.  When we do get around to producing a new release, you shouldn't have to worry too much about backwards compatibility.

pydoctor also optionally generates a system pickle with all the
information in, so you shouldn't really even need to parse anything...

pydoctor depends on nevow (practically speaking, anyway; there's a
writer that just builds up HTML by string interpolation but all the
funky new stuff is just in the nevow writer).  It is also vaguely
designed to be used as a library, so I think lore could import it.

Hi,
I have been looking at ways to have postfix talking to my twisted app
and today tried LMTP successfully for the first time. What I've done so
far is just subclass the ESMTP protocol and add do_LHLO which seems to
do the trick for some basic usage at least. Looking at
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2033.txt it seems like it shouldn't be to
hard to make a proper LMTP implementation. Perhaps someone more familiar
with twisted.mail could have a look.


class LMTP(smtp.ESMTP):
    def do_LHLO(self, rest):
        peer = self.transport.getPeer()
        try:
            host = peer.host
        except AttributeError:
            host = str(peer)
        self._helo = (rest, host)
        self._from = None
        self._to = []
        self.sendCode(250, '%s Hello %s, nice to meet you\n%s' %
(self.host, host,self.listExtensions()))

    def do_HELO(self,rest):
        return self.do_UNKNOWN(self,rest)
    def do_EHLO(self,rest):
        return self.do_UNKNOWN(self,rest)

Your mini LMTP implementation fails if a message is sent to several
recipients, since LMTP must answer with a status code per destination.
That is the main difference with SMTP.

But good starting point :)

Hope "somebody" takes the token and complete a RFC compliant
implementation... :-p

I have run into this issue as well when trying to order different
writes and make code run _after_ a write was completed.  I ended up
calling my code using deferToThread and putting in time.sleep calls to
make sure things got ordered correctly.  Ugly hack though.

The ITransport interface docs seem to imply that returning a deferred
from a write is not supported:

I make no representations about whether calls to me will happen
immediately or require returning to a control loop, or whether they
will happen in the same or another thread. Consider methods of this
class (aside from getPeer) to be 'thrown over the wall', to happen at
some indeterminate time.

I echo the question: why doesn't write return a deferred?  Surely
there are times you want to trigger events on the completion of a
write.

The way you do this is to hook up a producer to the transport. Hopefully
there are some references to this in the API docs: search for "producer" and
"consumer".

Eeeeew. Don't do that.

This is (more or less) what the producer API is for. Register a
IConsumer with transport.registerProducer and you will get callbacks
telling you when the transport buffer becomes empty or full.

Returning Deferred from every transport.write would make everything
rather slow... a wrapper that does this could be probably be written
using the producer/consumer API.

I though my hack would get a good response :)

Fantastic, I wasn't aware of this API.  I will defintely use this
approach from now on.

Thanks for the pointer.

Wow, thanks for the detailed and thoughful reply.

You've answered my questions and have given me another project to look at.
I'll check out Axiom, thanks.

For the record and the future list, it turned out that the persistence
problem was related to a pretty simple subclass of dict that was not happily
unpickling... but only when the new "protocol 2" was used to pickle/unpickle
objects. That was pretty hard to track down.

But of course, more importantly, I've learned how to do it right from here.

Thanks.

Some folks have already answered with the primary reason, which is to say, efficiency.  While Twisted definitely trades performance for flexibility in a number of places where reasonable, 'write()' is one of those things that just absolutely has to be as fast as possible, because many things which are highly  performance-critical call it.  Creating Deferreds could be 100x faster and it would still be too slow for this case.

There is anothe reason, though: returning a deferred from "write()" implies to the user that when the deferred fires, the bytes have been "written", e.g. the other end has received them.  In cases where .write() blocks, most naive programmers -- and yes, I say this having once been a "naive programmer" myself -- assume that the other end has not only received the bytes, it has processed them.  This is wrong, and can (and often does) have unfortunate consequences.

It sounds like you want control over excessive in-memory buffering, which is a pretty reasonable thing to want, and the IConsumer/IProducer interfaces you have already been directed to should provide that to you quite satisfactorily.

The reality is that when a 'write' completes and returns to userland, your bytes are somewhere between your kernel, your router, your cable modem, your ISP's cable modem, your ISP's internal routers, the backbone (...) your destination's kernel, and your destination's application.  You have no idea where they are, really, and neither does Twisted.  It just hides one more distinction from you: Twisted's buffer to your OS's buffer.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] error "limits.h missing" while compiling zope
 interface in Sumo on mac os x 10.4.6 Py 2.4
Message-ID: <1145468802.19327.259443736@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello Twisted gurus,

Apologies if this is a FAQ - couldn't find answers in the obvious
places. ( list archives, google, ...).

I've been trying to build the TwistedSumo-2006-02-12 package -
especially the ZopeInterface package within, and am getting the
following errors
about limits.h not being found.
This is on Mac OS X 10.4.6 on a PPC powerbook G4 with gcc 4.0, I tried
swicthing to 3.3 via gcc_select and got a different error about gcc
command line switches.
An 'ls' on
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/include/python2.4/
indicates that indeed there's no limits.h there.
Separately downloading earlier stable ZopeInterface version and building
gave exactly the same error.

Python 2.4 is the default python installed via the MacPython 2.4 dmg.
An older Python 2.3 also exists on the system but 2.4 is ahead in the
PATH.

Any help getting past this appreciated.

limits.h is a system header. From the invocation of gcc:

... it looks as if there's something wrong with your /Developer/SDKs/ 
MacOSX10.4u.sdk, since the compiler should be picking up a correct  
limits.h from somewhere in that tree. Is that directory installed on  
your machine? What version of Xcode do you have?

For the API I think you can use "epydoc" and extract it  from the code.
Though it would be great if someone made a tarball of all that documentation
so that
we could download and view it offline.

Hi,
I'm new to twisted and interested in using the ftp client module. But 
apart from the api reference I stumbled across did not find any docs on 
the ftp module. Are there any? It would be helpful if there was a doc 
outlining the use of the module, order in which the various methods 
should be called/not called, example use of the module etc.
 
Twisted looks highly appropriate for my project but without appropriate 
documentation I'm reluctant to use it.
 
Many thanks,

Ok, I had a closer look and here's a more complete version, that sends a
status code for each recipient. 
Try it out

See all edits by bakerson. Maybe we should disable edits by non-admin
users, or have a wiki-editor role people have to ask for.

Does trac have wiki undo?

For the moment, I've removed page creation and editing permissions.

Kind of a little.  Extremely inconvenient interface, but I've used it to remove the edits.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] callback errors?
Message-ID: <4dacb2560604201112q178ea545w16534b3c5a2a4d94@mail.gmail.com>

[Posting this to twisted and zope3 user, since I'm not sure which is
more germane]

I just install zope 3.2.0 on Gentoo.
I then manually configured a zope instance in /var/lib/zope/zope-3.2.0/
When I access the zope server at 192.168.0.100:8080, I get the
following error messages on my terminal:

What do these mean?
How can I resolve them?

Those are errors, yes, and they are coming from twisted.web2.  In fact,  
though, they aren't really errors in the sense of "something is broken".   
The problem is that web2 is raising an error rather than just returning a  
"Not Modified" response code.  It is harmless, although I do find it  
annoying myself.

Not sure what the fix would be; perhaps one of the web2 devs could opine  
on that?

Hope this helps,

Subject: [Twisted-Python] t.w jabber client question
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0604201501020.2597@akrherz-laptop.agron.iastate.edu>

Hi,

I am getting my feet wet with Twisted Words Jabber and have hit a wall. 
Here is my code:

from twisted.words.protocols.jabber import client, jid
from twisted.words.xish import domish
from twisted.internet import reactor

def sendMessage(factory, body):
     message = domish.Element(("jabber:client","message"))
     message['to']   = "me at myserver.com"
     message.addElement('body', content = body)
     message.addElement('subject', content ="Test")

     # What goes here?
     #factory.please_sendme_to_server(message)

myJID = jid.JID('guest at myserver.com/twisted_words')
factory = client.basicClientFactory(myJID, "password")
reactor.connectTCP('myserver.com',5222, factory)
reactor.callLater(5, sendMessage, factory, "Hi there" )
reactor.run()

So my question is how to send a message?  I can't seem to figure it out...

TIA,
   daryl

Hi all

I'm picking up twisted again ( haven't touched it for a while )

Luckily twisted plays great with psycopg2

I really prefer using the dictcursor in psycopg2 though:

does anyone know how to get twisted to utilize it?  i haven't been  
able to figure it out based on docs or google

a non twisted example of what i'm talking about follows
===

import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import extras

class DataBase:
	def __init__(self):
		self.profile = []
		self.db = psycopg2.connect 
( host="localhost",database="db",user="user",password="")
	def get_cursor(self):
		return self.db.cursor( cursor_factory = psycopg2.extras.DictCursor )

I use a "fake" dbapi module that wraps psycopg 2 and import it by giving
its name to the adbapi connection pool. Something like (let's suppose we
put it in a twistedpg.py module):

"""
from psycopg2 import *
from psycopg2 import _psycopg as _2psycopg
from psycopg2.extensions import connection as _2connection
from psycopg2.extras import DictCursor

del connect
def connect(*args, **kwargs):
    kwargs['connection_factory'] = connection
    return _2psycopg.connect(*args, **kwargs)

class connection(_2connection):
    def cursor(self):
        return _2connection.cursor(self, cursor_factory=DictCursor)
"""

Then:

"""
from twisted.enterprise import adbapi

mypool = adbapi.ConnectionPool("twistedpg", database="xxx", ...)
"""

Hope this helps,
federico

actually, i spoke too soon.

   i thought i was getting a dict, but it appears that I'm not.

i think it works for accessing a cursor directly, but i can't seem to  
get it to work with a ConnectionPool and deferred return

i definitely see twistedpd.connection.cursor called (for the dict  
cursor), but i can't trace to where its being used.

any suggestion ?  and thanks for pointing me to this direction so far.

I really don't know. It works perfectly here. Maybe show us our code and
how the pool is called.

good idea.  i'm kind of stressed out today - not thinking very  
clearly.  i'm probably dealing with a typo that i'm just not seeing.

i was using this w/twisted words, but i just copied the lines to  
replicate into the stub basic reactor .

Newby alert.

I am starting off with the "Twisted Mail Tutorial: Building an SMTP
Client from Scratch"
(http://twistedmatrix.com/users/warner/doc-latest/mail/tutorial/smtpclient/smtpclient.html#auto8).


I would like to send an attachment with my email. I presume I do this
through the sendEmail function but how to achieve is beyond me at the
moment. :-(

TIA.

Here is the code I use (to send PGN files, which are just text 
files). If you want to send images or binary files, you need to 
change the way pgn_part is constructed.

from email import Encoders
from email.Message import Message
from email.MIMEBase import MIMEBase
from email.MIMEMultipart import MIMEMultipart
#from email.MIMEImage import MIMEImage
from email.MIMEText import MIMEText

class EmailSender:
    def __init__(self, from_addr, smtp_host, 
                 smtp_user = None, smtp_password = None):
        self.from_addr = from_addr

Hey guys,

In a few specific cases (not as a general case) I'm sending a significant list 
of items over pb in a pb.RemoteCache/pb.Cacheable object pair. To give you an 
idea, it's a list of ~4000 tuples where each tuples has about ~10 strings of 
~10 length.

Right now twisted works fine, but takes about 10 seconds to 
serialize/send/unserialize the data, or I guess in twisted terms, 
banana/send/recv/banana the data.

Since my list is all primitives I thought maybe pickling it before sending 
would speed it up as banana would have to do less work, but I get a 

twisted.spread.banana.BananaError: string is too long to send (706378)

Is that an arbitrary length limit or technically significant?

Is there other methods of speeding this up?

Or alternatively, is it possible (within pb) to receive the state of  a 
RemoteCache or RemoteObject in definable chunks (say 100 items from the list 
at a time), allowing me to start displaying the data in my UI and adding more 
to it as it comes async?

Thanks,
--gabe

There's an hard-wired limit of 640KB that, according to a(n in)famous
figure, should be enough for anyone. ;-)

Slowness of PB with big data is a known problem, the situation should have
gotten better with newpb. Look at this thread:

Ah come on! Since when have we been limiting ourselves the the

I'm not sure how you are using RemoteCache, but the general technique here is to use a pager.  Take a look at twisted.spread.util.Pager, and the two examples/tools that come with it, StringPager and FilePager.

Very nice, I think that will be very usefull. It may put some holes in my 
abstraction with the current way I use RemoteCache, but I could imagine some 
design changes that would work.

Here is the idea I might try (if you care to comment)

Background: RemoteCachedTable represents some table view of a server-side 
database, thus on the client side it might go something like this (very 
simplified and NOT TESTED):

from twisted.spread import pb, util
class TableDataCollector(util.CallbackPageCollector):
    def __init__(self):
        self.table = None

    def remote_gotPage(self, page):
        self.table.data.extend(page)
        self.table.updateUi(False)

    def remote_endedPaging(self):
        self.table.updateUi(True)

class RemoteCachedTable(pb.RemoteCache):
   def setCopyableState(self,state):
        self.headers = state['headers']
        self.dataIsSmall = state['dataIsSmall']
        if self.dataIsSmall: #Ship the table data if its small, <100 rows
            self.data = state['data']
        else: #We receive the data through a Pager/Collector
            self.data = []
            self.collector = state['collector'] #A TableDataCollector instance
            self.collector.table = self

   def updateUi(self, finished):
        pass #Notify UI of changes to self.data

   #various observe_* methods go here

Obviously the server side stuff is not shown, but this depicts my intent :)

I don't think I have that right though. The "Server" here can not create the 
TableDataCollector instance and pass it back with the state dictionary can 
it? Somehow my "Client" needs to create the instance and send it to the 
server, at which point the server creates the StringPager (or TablePager), 
eh?

I'd bug the mailing list (or possibly IRC channel) for reviewers.
Unfortunately, nagging seems to be a necessarily evil to get your patch heard
sometimes.  I can't speak for all the developers, but I don't mind being nagged
because I realise this.  Well, I don't mind much <wink>.

Also, I think you should unassign the ticket from yourself seeing as there's
nothing for you to do to it at the moment (although this alone isn't likely make
much difference, we just don't have enough people looking over unassigned
issues).  You could try assigning to developers at random (glyph thinks this is
a good idea), but I don't think this really works very well -- e.g. I just spent
over a week not looking at the internet at all, let alone the issue tracker, so
things randomly assigned to me wouldn't have got anywhere.

Message-ID: <20060426022351.GB12864@sourdust.home.puzzling.org>

This is my resignation as Twisted's lead documentation person.

Rest assured I'm not resigning due to any subset of: burning
disillusionment, raging anger, or rampaging untreated mental illness.
Rather, I have a bundle of other projects, and they're increasingly
unrelated to Twisted, which means that I'm not using it for my own
projects, and, sadly, I don't have the energy left over to task switch
into an unrelated project enough to lead part of it.

I'm also, as it turns out, much more interested in reviewing and/or
editing documentation than I am in writing it. The upside of this is
that I'll continue to make myself available as a reviewer of
documentation patches and/or an editor, if needed. Feel free to assign
bugs on this basis. (I will probably not be reading the mailing list,
but I don't make myself difficult to find on IRC.) I will unassign other
bugs from myself soon.

This obviously leaves gaping holes in the greater Twisted universe for
people anxious to advertise the glory of Twisted to the admiring masses.
Do submit some documentation patches... It also leaves a vacancy for
someone who is willing to be caretaker for the documentation as a whole,
fixing minor bugs, farming out work and rearranging things according to
their taste. Apply here, I suspect :)

Thanks,

I've maintained Planet Jabber and Planet FOSDEM for a while now. It
would be no problem to add Planet Twisted to the same setup.

Mary, this Twisted user for one really appreciates the efforts you've
put forth. Indeed, as one of the biggest complainers about Twisted's
docs, I probably appreciate those efforts more than many users. (That
sounds backwards until you think about it for a while, like a lot of
legal language.)

I'm thinking about suggesting (gasp!) myself as your replacement. The
logical, responsible part of my brain is telling me that I'm insane for
doing this. But there's another part of my brain that has an illogical,
probably unhealthy fascination with Twisted and is raising its hand and
squirming on the uncomfortable wooden schooldesk chair with those huge
uncomfortable screw heads sticking out, yelling "Call on me! Call on me!"

As a registered patent agent (http://eepatents.com), I do a lot of
writing as part of my work and bill quite a bit per hour for doing so.
(Here that logical, responsible part is screaming, "So WHY do you want
to do more writing for FREE?") I have complained and whined about the,
shall we say "mixed," state of Twisted's docs for years now on #twisted
and am intrigued by the idea of putting my mouth (dictation) where my
mouth (complaints) is. Plus, (branch) commit access would be kind of
cool for writing those docstrings where I just can't stand seeing those
glaring holes right below "def" or "class"...

It goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway) that there is and would
be absolutely no professional relationship between me and the Twisted
project. (Most free software types aren't all that enamored with
patents, anyhow...) I have kind of enjoyed the decidedly unprofessional
relationship that has developed on #twisted, though.

Comments welcome. Any positive ones will likely be viewed with suspicion
and will raise pangs of regret at my making this rash posting. The
negative ones will likely be viewed with relief, at least by the
aforementioned logical, responsible part...

Best regards,

Thank you for communicating this. I really like when it happens to
someone else; then I realize I am not the only one that goes straight to
debugging gcc assembler output looking for compiler bugs before noting
an unitialized variable. :D

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted's ability to handle many open connections.
Message-ID: <17487.57970.85904.437295@terry.jones.tc>

I'm completely new to Twisted. As I understand it, a Twisted server runs as
a single process - no forking, no threads. To me that implies that select
(or poll or pselect, etc) is being heavily used to feed data to Deferreds.

If that's the case, how does Twisted (portably) allow for a large number of
file descriptors?

I'm considering using Twisted for a project. Twisted would front requests
from the web, but also from (e.g.) remote command line applications via an
API.  These latter connections could potentially be numerous, and long
lived.  Should I be thinking about how Twisted deals with this, or does it
already scale to allow more simultaneous connections / file descriptors
than a naive server program would be able to maintain?

Given what looks like widespread use of Deferreds in Twisted, I suppose
that there is not a 1-1 relationship between connections and file
descriptors? If so this makes the issue more pressing.

Thanks for any help,
Terry

That's more or less accurate.  It sounds like you understand this, but because I can never repeat it enough: Deferreds don't do anything magic or get involved with select() directly, it's just that their callback() methods are called from other callbacks which are ultimately invoked as a result of the return value of select().

>If that's the case, how does Twisted (portably) allow for a large number of

Twisted doesn't do *anything* portably :).

On Windows, there is a reactor that supports a maximum of 63 concurrent events (assuming your process has no windows open).  On UNIX the default reactor is still select() based and will definitely bog down if you have too many simultaneous sockets open.  Sometimes it is handled quite badly!

However, the selection of a reactor is a configuration option, not an application-architecture issue (unless, of course, you are writing a GUI which has requirements for what event loop it will run on).

You can choose a reactor with the -r argument to twistd, trial, and other similar tools like axiomatic.  You can choose different reactors for different platforms.  Application code should be none the wiser.

There are some pretty darn naive programs out there.  The default naive case of a server that I'm aware of accept()s one connection, reads (blocking) the entire socket, then writes a response.  That is 1 simultaneous connection: so in that case, yes, Twisted can do better :).  However, it doesn't use any crazy tricks, and is likely to scale far worse than something like ACE or Sandstorm, i.e. any research project designed specifically just to scale.  Scale is only one of Twisted's many considerations, as it aims to be a completely generic networking application layer.

The most scalable reactor you are likely to find on UNIX is the "poll" reactor.  There is a kqueue reactor but it is by all accounts terrible (ie, performs worse than poll due to unfortunate design decisions in the python/kqueue bindings) and needs to be rewritten.  In every case I'm aware of, other scalability concerns (usually the speed of Python itself) was an issue long before the IO overhead of simultaneous connections broke poll().  If your application has such a case, though, implementing an epoll, aio, kqueue, libevent, or <insert your totally non-portable, OS-specific, crazily scalable IO multiplexing API here> reactor should not be an inordinate amount of work.  Less work, at least, than building such a beast and then writing what amounts to 2/3 of the Twisted core around it anyway :).

Again, Deferreds do not create file descriptors or have anything to do with select().  They are simply a Python object abstraction for callbacks.

Depends what you mean by 'connections'.  listenTCP, listenUNIX, etc, create a listening socket.  They accept() on that, and each buildProtocol is invoked after a connected socket is created.  Each of those is a file descriptor.  If you keep disk files or pipes open outside of Twisted, those are also file descriptors, etc etc etc.  You can have virtual "connections" which multiplex  multiple Protocol objects over a single transport though, or otherwise have fewer file descriptors than "connections" in that sense.

Correct. Twisted is event driven. It doesn't need to fork and spawn 
threads to handle a lot of network connections at once.

However, Twisted is perfectly capable of managing any processes and 
threads an application *needs* to create. In fact, Twisted's core 
includes APIs specifically created to handle background processes and 
threads.

select/poll/whatever is at the core of Twisted's event loop, known as 
the 'reactor' but Deferreds are completely unrelated to data delivery.

A Deferred is a callback mechanism, nothing more. A function typically 
returns a Deferred to say, "hey, you asked me to do something and I will 
give my response ... just not right now".

As you recognised, Twisted uses a select loop so I'm not quite sure what 
your question means. However ...

Twisted chooses the best available reactor implementation for the 
platform. "Best", here, probably meaning most available (default?) 
rather than fastest.

I'm no expert here but on Linux the reactor really does use a select() 
loop, on win32 it uses the win32 equivalent of a select loop 
(WSAEventSelect and MsgWaitForMultipleObjects, or something), and I 
believe it uses poll on the BSDs.

If the "best" reactor is not actually the best (if you see what I mean!) 
then you can manually install a non-default reactor. There are plenty to 
choose from.

For instance, on Linux if you want to handle a huge number of 
simultaneous connections then installing a poll-based reactor is 
probably a good idea. If your application uses GTK+ then you would 
install a GTK+ reactor.

This is what Twisted excels at - multi-protocol network applications. 
I've done it many times now and it just works.

Twisted already includes support (of varying quality) for most common 
protocols but it's very easy to add new protocols if necessary.

Twisted is event driven and most people believe that event driven scales 
better, especially for network-related work. I therefore believe Twisted 
will *help* you write code that will scale to a high number of 
simultaneous connections. Twisted does perform any magic though.

You will need to understand event driven programming to scale up, 
otherwise you're likely to block the application from doing more than 
one thing at a time (in the cooperatively multitasking sense) making 
your application utterly unscalable.

Also, note that Twisted does not magic away other common problems 
associated with scalability. The obvious one that springs to mind 
(because it bit me recently :-/) is the maximum number of file 
descriptors a non-root Linux process can open per process.

There is absolutely a 1-1 relationship between connections and file 
descriptors but Deferred have nothing to do with it.

It's quite possible to write a Twisted application without ever using a 
Deferred. If your application can respond immediately (well, very 
quickly) to requests that arrive from the network then you don't need 
Deferreds.

You need a Deferred when you cannot respond immediately. In that case 
you would create a Deferred and store it somewhere, spawn something 
*non-blocking* to handle the request and return the Deferred to the 
caller. Then, when the non-blocking thing completes, you callback via 
the Deferred you stored to let the caller know the result.

Thanks for the details. Sounds like I can handle the problem, if it ever
happens, by simply bumping FD_SETSIZE and rebuilding the kernel, then
proceeding as normal. And/or drop old connections.

Ok, great. I'm actually backing my way out of using lots of already written
low-level asynchronous networking code, my own RPC mechanism, etc., in
favor of letting someone else do that work :-) So I do know what you mean,
and agree.

Thanks again.

I think that, oddly enough, Mary's resignation comes because she was the most dilligent member of the team, taking her documentation-maintenance responsibilities more seriously than almost anyone else over the packages they maintain (myself included).

No need to insist - with the level of competition we usually have, you're in!

The position of "documentation maintainer" is a bit unusual since it was actually taken consciously and willingly.  Usually the protocol is this: I appoint someone for a task, which they are not qualified to do.  Then, they have to fight a bear if they don't want to do it.

Now that you've volunteered, there's no getting out of it.  I mean, do you want to fight a bear?  I wouldn't.  Bears are *scary* - just ask Stephen Colbert.

Well, I guess you could consider my comment positive.  I think you'll do a great job, since few people seem to care so much about documentation.

By the way, do you know anyone who might be similarly duped into becoming the website maintainer?  (might you?)

OK.

Yes. Plus, it's nice to see how quickly a mailing list reacts when you're
thinking of using a new product :-) Twisted has a bit of a reputation for
being obscure, but it looks much better to me than any alternative - at
least for serious networking tasks (not just serving web pages fished up of
the nearest database). I have high hopes.

Anyway, thanks again.

Just to known.
Suppose I found some time to document some parts of Twisted.
Many things in twisted.python are undocumented, log is rougly documented
and usage docs are not really complete.

I have to submit a ticket/patch?


By the way: here are some parts for witch I would like to see documentation:
1) twisted.python
2) description of design patterns used in twisted
3) all(?) interfaces, like IConsumer

4) parts of twisted deprecated/unmaintained/abandoned/not to be used
5) parts of twisted that need recoding (twisted.news?)
6) servers used in production enviroment with use cases



Thanks and regards  Manlio Perillo

This kind of information should be submitted as a bug at
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/newticket and marked as belonging to the
'website' component. (I tended to prefer each individual problem be
filed as a separate bug, this mail sounds like two bugs.)

This would be the usual way to do it. I used to accept some through
email to, but that just adds another step for the person you mail them
to: they file a bug based on your mail. I had a post about what made a
good docs bug here:

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Naming test methods constructed with
	deferredGenerator - is it possible?
Message-ID: <200604281414.35595.Marcin.Kasperski@softax.com.pl>

In my trial tests I have a few test methods constructed using 
deferredGenerator idiom. Something like that:

  def testSomething(self):
       # ... do something
       yield defer.waitForDeferred(someDeferred)
       # ... do something
       yield defer.waitForDeferred(otherDeferred)
       # ... do something
  testSomething = defer.deferredGenerator(testSomething)

Let's write clean code and works perfectly.    ... Almost.
The problem is that in the verbose test output I get 

      <lambda> ...                        [OK]

Of course I would prefer

     testSomething ...                   [OK]

Is it possible to name the function returned by deferredGenerator 
somehow? If not, how to solve this situation? Extra problem is 
that if I add sth like 'def testSomethingWrapped(self):' calling 
generator inside, then trial will consider both testSomethign 
and testSomethingWrapped as independed test methods...

Shot in the dark; try adding:

    testSomething.__name__ = "testSomething"

or

    testSomething.__doc__ = "testSomething"

Not pretty, but I think it will work.  You could maybe use a util func like:

def defGen(f):
  gen = defer.deferredGenerator(f)
  gen.__name__ = f.__name__
  gen.__doc__ = f.__doc__
  return gen

I think this may be fixed in twisted 2.2.

I use the following replacement for the standard twisted sendmail function:

from twisted.mail import smtp
from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.internet import defer

try:
    from cStringIO import StringIO
except ImportError:
    from StringIO import StringIO

def sendmail_auth(smtphost, user, password,
                 from_addr, to_addrs, msg, senderDomainName=None, port=25):
    if not hasattr(msg,'read'):
        msg = StringIO(str(msg))
    d = defer.Deferred()
    factory = smtp.ESMTPSenderFactory(user, password, from_addr, to_addrs, msg, d,
                                      requireTransportSecurity=False)
    if senderDomainName is not None:
        factory.domain = senderDomainName
    reactor.connectTCP(smtphost, port, factory)
    return d

(nothing wise, just copied original and changed to ESMTPSenderFactory). Maybe it would make sense to add something like that to twisted.

Finally such one does the job:

    gen = defer.deferredGenerator(function)
    gen.__doc__ = function.__name__

My Debian claims that I am using 2.2.0, so maybe it was patched 
later.

I guess that the fix would be adding within deferredGenerator 
construct like the one suggested by Mike (setting __doc__ of 
returned lambda function to __name__ of wrapped function)

This isn't correct, of course.  It just happens to do something kind of useful when the deferred generator is a trial test method.  In other cases, it would be weird to find the __doc__ of the returned object to be the __name__ of the wrapped function.

In Python 2.4, setting __name__ works, and deferredGenerator tries to do that, so trial will only have this problem with Python 2.3.  You could define a helper function for your tests which calls deferredGenerator and sets __doc__ appropriately, if switching to Python 2.4 isn't an option.

It seems the appropriate rituals have performed and Ed is now the lead
documentation maintainer for Twisted. So they should be assigned to him,
but I don't know what his bugtracker login is.

I think it's possible not to assign tickets to anyone (I don't know trac
very well), so that's the backup plan.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Crash when using XmlRPC during reactor shutdown
Message-ID: <20060429151006.GB16623@natulte.net>

Hi,

I have been experiencing a crash when trying to use the XmlRPC query
subsystem while the reactor is shutting down.

The context of it is that my twisted application talks to an upstream
server using XmlRPC.  When it comes online, it registers, and when it
goes offline, it should unregister itself, using a simple XmlRPC
query.

So, I figured the natural place to put the notifications were in the
startService and stopService methods, that get called at just the
right time.  startService is not a problem, and works fine.  for
stopService, I made the method return the XmlRPC Deferred, so that the
reactor would wait until request completion before continuing the
shutdown.

The thing is, with this scheme Twisted dumps an exception during
shutdown, because the XmlRPC Deferred gets fired twice.  I've
reproduced this behaviour with a minimal application:

****************************************************************
****************************************************************
from twisted.application.service import Service
from twisted.python import log
from twisted.web.xmlrpc import Proxy
from twisted.application.service import Application, IServiceCollection
from twisted.internet import reactor, defer

class TestXmlRpcService(Service):
    def startService(self):
        log.msg("Starting service")
        reactor.callLater(0, reactor.stop)

    def stopService(self):
        def handle_success(res):
            log.msg("Unregistration successful, but reactor will now crash")
            return True
        def handle_error(e):
            log.msg("Unregistration failed...")
            return False

        log.msg("Calling XmlRPC backend (and crashing)")
        p = Proxy('http://natulte.net/pub/fgs/RPC2.php')
        defer.setDebugging(True)
        # Call any old method, this is just a proof of concept
        d = p.callRemote('fgsd.register',
                         "00000000000000000000000000000000",
                         "bleh")
        d.addCallbacks(handle_success, handle_error)
        return d


service = TestXmlRpcService()
application = Application("proxy")
service.setServiceParent(application)
****************************************************************
****************************************************************

If you run that with `twistd -n -l- -y test.tac`, you should see the
crash immediately.

I know that patients shouldn't give diagnostics about their problems
to the doctor, but nevertheless, examining the exception log, I
believe I know what the problem is.

 - When stopService returns a Deferred, the reactor stops the shutdown
   and adds callbacks to the Deferred, to resume shutdown at the right
   time.

 - The XmlRPC query succeeds, and fires the Deferred. It walks right
   down the notification chain, and eventually trips the reactor's
   callback.

 - The reactor, within the callback, resumes shutdown, and calls
   disconnectAll to kill all active connections.

 - At this point, the XmlRPC query still has its socket open, and so
   gets notified that the connection was lost.  It attempts to fire
   our Deferred's errback to notify of this, and foom,
   AlreadyCalledError.

If this makes sense, the resolution might be simple: close the
transport connection before firing the deferred, so that the reactor
can't kill the connection and trigger the double-call.

The other option would be to include a flag in the xmlrpc query
object, to avoid double-firing in this (admitedly corner-case)
situation.

Does all that make sense?  And, of course, does anyone have an idea of
a workaround I could use in the meantime?  As I'm shutting down the
service anyway, the exception is not really a problem in itself, it's
just a little unclean to have an exception dump in the logs at each
shutdown.

Thanks in advance (and already, for Twisted :-),
- Dave.

After a bit more fiddling, I found a functional workaround.  The trick
is indeed to let the xmlrpc Deferred fully terminate *before* the
reactor continues the shutdown, instead of continuing the shutdown
within the Deferred callback.

With that in mind, the new stopService makes the RPC call, but
creates, stores and returns a different Deferred.  The RPC Deferred
gets a callback that calls reactor.callLater to schedule the firing of
the reactor's Deferred in 0 seconds.

That lets the xmlrpc deferred complete and clean up, and immediately
after the reactor schedules its own shutdown callback, and all is
well.

Here is the new stopService code:

****************************************************************
****************************************************************
    def stopService(self):
        def handle_success(res):
            log.msg("Unregistration successful, and reactor won't crash")
            reactor.callLater(0, self._def.callback, True)
        def handle_error(e):
            log.msg("Unregistration failed...")
            reactor.callLater(0, self._def.callback, False)

        log.msg("Calling XmlRPC backend (and crashing)")
        p = Proxy('http://natulte.net/pub/fgs/RPC2.php')
        d = p.callRemote('fgsd.register',
                         "00000000000000000000000000000000",
                         "bleh")
        self._def = defer.Deferred()
        d.addCallbacks(handle_success, handle_error)
        return self._def
****************************************************************
****************************************************************

Nevertheless, this feels more like a workaround than a complete
solution.  What do you all think?

- Dave.

You'll notice I've reassigned some tickets to you and will continue to

Subject: [Twisted-Python] ProducerConsumerProxy problem
Message-ID: <7a1008db0604300717m76b7217cg65ecef2aa6d5ce53@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to setup a ProducerConsumerProxy between a
protocols.basic.FileSender producer and a TCP Protocol transport.
I have the following code:

fileObj = file('test.txt','r')
proxy = protocols.pcp.ProducerConsumerProxy(self.transport)
producer = protocols.basic.FileSender()
dd = producer.beginFileTransfer(fileObj, proxy)
dd.addCallback(self.uploadDone)
dd.addErrback(self.uploadError)
proxy.registerProducer(producer, False)

The problem is that only 16KB of data are transfered and then the
transfer pauses. Also if I use BasicProducerConsumerProxy no data at
all gets transfered. I think that the proxy doesn't call resumeProducing()
on
the FileSender producer and thats why the transfer seems to halt.

Any suggestions ?

I found the solution.

The problem was that by default our proxys producer is registered with
streaming = True
which is not what we want.
The following line will register our proxys producer with streaming = False
ProducerConsumerProxy.iAmStreaming = False
The rest is the same.
I think adding an argument to ProducerConsumerProxy.__init__ about streaming
would
be a good idea.
proxy = ProducerConsumerProxy(self.client.transport)
dd = FileSender().beginFileTransfer(self.outgoingFile, proxy)
dd.addCallback(self.uploadDone)
dd.addErrback(self.uploadError)

twisted/doc/pb/using-pb.xhtml introduces the new concepts, there're some
examples, and iirc there's been an 0.01 release recently.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Status of components, protocols, etc in Twisted
Message-ID: <17493.24492.57227.748654@terry.jones.tc>

I'm trying to better understand componentized architectures, protocols,
adaptors etc., as done in Python. I've been reading around and have a few
questions about the state of play. It would be good to understand where
things are, and where they're heading.

It seems there are (or were) 3 efforts to provide components, protocols,
adaptors, etc.: Zope, Twisted, PyProtocols.

It looks like Twisted is now using the zope module to do this. But I also
ran across discussion (on this list, in Feb 2004, I think), about possibly
migrating zope's use of components to PyProtocols. Did that happen?

I do like the sound of PyProtocols (and PEAK in general), but as someone
else said, and as Philip wrote, the documentation isn't really focused on
easing in a newbie.  A couple of points on those docs, I think it would be
good if someone set out how you would go about building something small
(i.e., small concrete examples, not "big" more abstract ones). Yes, that
someone could be me, agreed. Also, the docs say that it is intended that
_all_ uses of type(), isinstance() etc., can/should be replaced. A few use
cases would be helpful - how are we supposed to replace those things? I do
have the impression that one should have a clean componentized design from
the beginning and thereby never need or want to resort to introspection. If
that's the case, it might be worth saying, as the docs leave one wondering
if there's not perhaps some formulaic way to rewrite one's code to do the
Right Thing.  It's not that simple though, right?

I'd also be happy to use the standard Twisted (i.e., zope) approach too.

Do people have an opinion about which is better to use? Does it make much
difference if you're just building a simple app with a handful of
components you'd like to be able to swap in & out easily?

I think the Twisted evolution of finger pages are really good, with a
couple of minor weak points (e.g., highlighting new code from example to
example). It's amazing what you can get done in a couple of hundred lines
of Twisted code. BTW, there's a mention of __implements__ whereas
implements() is used, which I guess is a hang over from an earlier version?
This is on
http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/tutorial/components.html
I guess someone will look for others. Grepping __implements__ gets a lot of
hits in the distributed Twisted-2.2.0 docs (e.g., in doc/howto/*.html).

Anyway, thanks for all the docs and code. I'm happy to put some work into
making improvements where I can.

Terry

Today, Twisted simply provides a single global registry on top of Zope Interface's normal layer.  Twisted's original interface implementation was derivative of Zope's and introduced some horrible bugs and some interesting ideas; the interesting ideas were incorporated into Zope, and the horrible bugs left behind.

No.  Some people liked PyProtocols better, but we had the discussion, we made the decision, and Zope Interface has worked out very well.

The release isn't out yet; I'm currently working on another (small) round of
improvements to the release infrastructure and hopefully a lot of stuff will
be released soon.

So does this.  Why isn't it cool for the parent process to drop the connection?

hi all!
  i'm trying to develop a COm server application with wxpython, but i have
many thread problems (the GUI can't be in the same thread of the COM server
and also if i do it I have serious cleanup problems...). Can twisted help me
in maintain my GUI in a separate thread and talking to the COM server
instance?

thanks a lot,

"range(0, 1, 2)" is a particularly obscure way to say "[0]".  I'm guessing
there's no test coverage for reading binary data from stdout or stderr of
subprocesses?

Alas, this won't do anything resembling correct in a Twisted application.

I tried to come up with an answer to this question earlier today, but failed: perhaps the OP can ask a more specific or detailed one which will be easier to answer correctly.

I don't know where to begin. Could you pretend that nobody on this list  
knows what COM is and ask your question again?

What are you using Twisted for now?
What else are you hoping Twisted can help you with?
What exactly are the limitation you are dealing with?

Hmm.  As a matter of fact, the test which covers stdin should also cover stdout.  I'm not sure why that wasn't failing.  I meant [0, 1, 2] or range(0, 3).

I would fix it, but this weekend is pretty much over, and my next 3 weekends are spoken for.  Does somebody want to take over maintainership of this area?  I only started working on it because I wanted to be able to work on Divmod code at the same time as playing video games in Windows.

Not really, No. I think you should have waited for the OP to ask a better  
question as JP suggested. The quality of questions on this mailing list  
has been very poor lately. Anyway, onwards...

To shut down a Service cleanly, you call stopService() on it.

If you want your service to have its stopService method called when  
Twisted shuts down, then
that service should be registered correctly. If you aren't using twistd  
then see
twisted.application.app.startApplication

>>> An example test.tac file:

 from twisted.application import service

class MyService(service.Service):
     def stopService(self):
         print "Stopping my service!"
         service.Service.stopService(self)

application = service.Application("My Twisted App")
myService = MyService()
myService.setName("My Service")
myService.setServiceParent(application)

 from twisted.internet import reactor
reactor.callLater(2, reactor.stop)

<<< End test.tac

If you run the .tac file with "twistd -noy test.tac", after 2 seconds,
you will see "Stopping my service!" printed.

Either use twistd with a .tac, as someone else suggested, or:

reactor.addSystemEventTrigger('before', 'shutdown', myservice.stopService)

If stopService returns a Deferred this will delay shutdown until
Deferred returned from stopService is triggered.

We're considering using a process inspired by yours at Allmydata, but we don't
call it "branch-based", since the word "branch" means something else in our
workflow.  Also we use darcs instead of SVN, and there is no particular sense
in which "branches" are important to our version of this process.

Message-ID: <d27002d90604031015m231e291fi7e38095a96e217f1@mail.gmail.com>

pb logs failures with an error of type pb.Error if these failures are
returned by remotely-invoked methods; however, if these methods raise the
same Error, it is not logged.

Is this difference intentional or accidental?

Shouldn't this difference be removed?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <d27002d90604031105x591bb47fw6e5d3a82b148e518@mail.gmail.com>

in pb.Broker._sendError, if fail is a Failure with a jellyable value, then
the value, rather than the failure, is serialized.

When this value reaches the other side, it is wrapped in a failure. But all
the other information in the remote Failure is lost.

This seems inconsistent to me, and indeed has caused me a bug. If a method
returns a CopyableFailure that has a Jellyable value, then there's no
apparent reason for the information in the failure not to be sent - it
doesn't make sense to me that whether or not the value is Jellyable
determines whether or not the Failure's fields get sent.

I can work around this, but I thought maybe this should be changed in pb.

comments?

I'm trying to figure out how the IMAP4 server does both TLS and SASL, but it
seems to me to be missing some significant parts.

What do I have to do to make this server run?  There's no apparent code to 
_start_ either IMAP or POP servers in this package, though there's a number of 
different .tacs for the SMTP server.

It would appear that your server has two active interfaces with
different IPs on the same network. You wouldn't happen to be running
Solaris and IPMP by any chance, would you? Could we possibly see the
output from ifconfig -a?

Twisted contains an IMAP4 server protocol implementation.  It does not contain 
a complete IMAP4 server.  For this, you need a storage mechanism; the complexity 
of IMAP4 places this beyond the current practical scope of Twisted.

"mktap mail --help" should get you started in the right direction for creating a 
POP3 or SMTP server.

Divmod, Inc., my employer, contributed the protocol implementation to Twisted 
while developing a complete IMAP4 server, Quotient.  IMAP4 isn't the focal point 
of the current version of Quotient, but it is likely support will reappear in 
some not-too-distant version.

How are you setting up your UDP communication? Are you using reactor.listenUDP or .connectUDP? Can you provide a minimal code example?

I don't know about windows, but there is an 'interface' optional arg to both those functions that might be useful.

You need to listen separately on each IP address. Unfortunately  
neither twisted nor python has an API for enumerating all the  
addresses of a host, so you'll have to configure them  manually.

Hmm. I've encountered this kind of issue under Solaris with IPMP in that
if you have more than one active interface on a given network, you can't
easily predict which IP address the OS will choose for outbound packets.
I'm not familiar with the Windows selection algorithm.

Is the SNMP program on the Windows box yours or under your control? Or
are you writing something that does an SNMP GET to this windows box? If
it's your program, have a look at the 'interface' option that Stephen
mentioned. Otherwise it becomes a non-twisted issue around the interface
configuration on the Windows box. You want to be able to set the box up
so that it always sends packets out with a known source IP, or have the
receiving program identify responses in an IP address independant way.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] UDP answer from different IP
Message-ID: <E1FRPBJ-0001Bm-00@pyramid.twistedmatrix.com>

I would like to clarify the situation and describe my current work-around:

My twisted application is on client machine A. It sends  SNMP requests to server machine B.

         self.proxy = agentproxy.AgentProxy(
            ipAddress, port,            					# here   '130.119.127.196', 6665
            community = community,
            snmpVersion = 'v1',
            protocol = self.port.protocol,
        )
        df = self.proxy.getTable(oids, timeout= 0.5, retryCount=5)

Machine B has two interfaces to the network with IP '130.119.127.196' and '130.119.127.127' . Here runs some arbitrary SNMP Agent.

Twisted on A opens a port (25000 or so) and sends getNext requests.
These requests contain an ID, that is later used to identifiy incoming messages and  relate them to the request.

To do this snmpprotocol.py has a function getRequestKey, that retrieves this ID from protocol elements.

When sending the getNext-message getRequestKey() returns:

(('130.119.127.196', 6665), 782)

This is the key which later should work to identify this request when the answers from B arrive.

But since B uses the other interface to answer, the message that arrives carries:

(('130.119.127.127', 6665), 782) and this key is not known.

I wonder why we need the IP address and port at this point, since the ID (782) is unique to machine A and port 25000 and is sufficient to identify the request to which this incoming message belongs.

I patched in snmpprotocol.py:

	def getRequestKey( self, request, target ):
		"""Get the request key from a request/response"""
		for key in [
			'get_request', 'get_response',
			'get_next_request', 'get_bulk_request',
			'response', 'set_request',
		]:
			try:
				ID = request['pdu'][key]['request_id']
			except KeyError, err:
				pass
			except TypeError, err:
				log.error(
					"""Unexpected TypeError retrieving request key %r: %s""",
					key, log.getException(err),
				)
			else:
#				return target, ID.get()
				return ID.get()
		raise KeyError( """Unable to get a request key id from %s for target %s"""%( request, target))

This worked.
Could this be checked by some expert ? Any problem with this approach ?

Thanks
Wolfgang

Then the SNMP code you're using is wrong. As you have found, it is 
EXTREMELY common for this to happen (the SNMP reply to come from a 
different IP than the request was sent to). Whether it's a wrong thing 
for the router/host to do is irrelevant for practical purposes - lots 
and lots of network equipment, some of it very expensive, does it.

My SNMP code does as you suggest, just uses the port number and ID number.

I can't see if that's the specific right thing to patch since I'm not 
familiar with TwistedSNMP, but as I say I have a python/C-helper SNMP 
stack, and it does exactly as you suggest, so if it works I'd say you've 
fixed it.

You should leave the original function names around here somewhere, in a comment or a doc-string, since they are direct references to the spec which defines these transformations.

"instances that implement"?  This is confusing.  Do you really mean "classes which implement" or "instances which provide"?

This is probably meant to be @type.

Typo here, and the only thing portals do is handle login, so is this really a useful piece of documentation? ;)

Message-ID: <20060407211917.53349.qmail@web30007.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi,

HTTP 1.1 persistent connection requires replies to be
send by the server in the order requests are received.
At least this is the way I understand the HTTP clients
can associate request/reply send and received thru the
TCP/IP.

I use Twisted twisted.protocols.http for very specific
application. There is a Twisted based HTTP server
which in some cases must reply in different order.

Now, I went thru the http module code and all the
outstanding requests results are steamed into IOString
and later flushed out in the correct order.

Is there any way to disable queuing. I tried to
overriteRequest.queued by passing 0 in to the__init__
but it yields some other problems. I use 1.3 Twisted.


Thanks in advance, A.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Cleanly shutting down Service
In-Reply-To: <1144078575.9211.5.camel@localhost.localdomain>
Message-ID: <E1FS1lW-0003CX-00@pyramid.twistedmatrix.com>

I have two related questions about this.

I have been using

reactor.addSystemEventTrigger('before', 'shutdown',
myservice.beforeStopService) (not using .tac)

In my beforeStopService() function I need to do two things:

1) I have two factories, and two different protocols, that use two different
ports. Both have the same application set as service parent. I would like to
shut down connections on only ONE of the two ports before I proceed with
pre-shutdown procedures. How do I do this?

I am only aware of  
twisted.internet.reactor.disconnectAll()
But that shuts down all connections on BOTH ports.

Here is the simplified structure of my application:

#this connects to another server, I need this to stay open during
pre-shutdown
server_connector = ConnectorFactory()
server_connector.protocol = protocols.IconsToSellersProtocol
server_connector.service = myservice
serv_to_serv = twisted.application.internet.TCPClient(HOST, PORT_1,
server_connector).setServiceParent(application)

#this accepts connections from clients, I need this to close this during
pre-shutdown
client_factory = twisted.internet.protocol.ServerFactory()
client_factory.protocol = protocols.ClientProtocol
client_factory.service = myservice
client_factory.service.sc_protocol = server_connector.protocol
client_serv=twisted.application.internet.TCPServer(PORT_2,
client_factory).setServiceParent(application)

2) This scenario is simliar to 1), except that I want to stop accepting new
connections on PORT_2 in my pre-shutdown procedure, leaving the existent
connections on PORT_2 in ESTABLISHED state intact.

Either use twistd with a .tac, as someone else suggested, or:

reactor.addSystemEventTrigger('before', 'shutdown', myservice.stopService)

If stopService returns a Deferred this will delay shutdown until
Deferred returned from stopService is triggered.

Hello,

I reckon it's about time for another AU sprint.

The likely locations are Sydney or Melbourne, and the likely dates are
any weekend in May, the first weekend of June or the last weekend of
June.

Topics are as yet undecided.  I intend to remove wait() entirely.

I tentatively suggest that the Sprint be:
- In Sydney
- June 24-25
(patches accepted)

Can you make it? Reply today!

cheers,
jml

If it's in Sydney yes, in Melbourne likely not (for entirely slefish
reasons involving throwing perfectly good money that could be spend on
sprinting at scuba diving).

If it's in Sydney I suggest going through Bob Kummerfeld as per post #4

Subject: [Twisted-Python] marking 3 problem tests on Windows 'todo'
In-Reply-To: 0
Message-ID: <20060410023926.22481.1056588948.divmod.quotient.11928@ohm>

Currently there are 3 tests which are causing problems on the select reactor on win32, as detailed by this build report: 

http://twistedmatrix.com/buildbot/win32-select/builds/445/step-default/2

I think they should all be marked 'todo'.  Although ideally all the functionality these tests cover should be supported on Windows, the tests themselves are somewhat suspect, and marking them as 'todo' conditionally for the platform would turn the Windows buildbot green, allowing us to notice much more quickly when other, more serious things have gone wrong.

I am writing out a big rationale here becuase normally .todo'ing tests which are passing is a big no-no, and I think that this is something of a special case due to the long period of neglect for the platform involved.

The test in question are:

 * twisted.pb.test.test_negotiate.CrossfireReverse.test1

I've talked to brian about this test being todo'd because it is intermittently failing on _all_ platforms; windows just seems to have a far greater chance of failing.

 * twisted.test.test_udp.MulticastTestCase.testJoinFailure

I'm not really sure what is going on here.  Some nuance of error reporting in Python?  127.0.0.1 _is_ considered a multicast address on Windows?  This seems like it should be TODO'd conditionally, and there should be a ticket to conclusively diagnose it.

 * twisted.web2.test.test_http.SSLServerTest.testLingeringClose

Buffering 'lo' on Windows is weird.  I don't think that there is a proper way to fix this; IMHO the test is slightly buggy.  It's worth noting that the thing that's blowing up is a direct call to openssl's send(), _not_ a Twisted API.

While I think that this test is sort of suspicious, and it should figure out a way to be more lenient to its subprocess, I think that it can be todo'd for win32 since the behavior being tested isn't platform dependent, only the client APIs involved.  I believe that the ticket here should use Twisted in the subprocess so that if there is a portability issue with buffering, we can properly abstract it.

 * twisted.test.test_ssl.ConnectionLostTestCase.testFailedVerify

This is reporting the wrong error, but it is correctly dropping the connection.  There is a small security risk here, which bothers me, but there may be no way to expose the proper information without fixing bugs in openssl.  Considering that this passes on UNIX I believe it should also be conditionally marked on Windows.  The ticket here is simply to get the test to pass, since I think the test itself is OK in this circumstance.


In conclusion: one of these tests should be todo'd on all platforms, the rest should be todo'd conditionally if isWindows().  Any objections?

Hmmm.  I don't see any changes related to wait() in these hunks. ;)

While it doesn't appear that this change *introduced* a new race condition, it does seem as though it has jostled things so as to cause an existing one to start going the wrong way.

This seems to be a pretty common one in the test suite, so everyone pay attention.

Just because one side of a TCP connection has had its connection-established-successfully callback fired (ie, buildProtocol on the Factory) does not mean that both sides of the TCP connection have had this callback fired.  Quite often, in fact, this is not the case (particularly on platforms you forgot to run the unit tests on ;).

This ftp setUp needs to be made to wait for both the server and the client to become connected before proceeding.  The failure to do so can be seen as a new failing test on the reactors buildslave in the Qt step.

(Of course, the Qt step was already red, because a previous branch uncovered still another race condition.)

Please revert the branch or fix the race post-haste.  If someone would take a look at the failing tcp half-close test on that reactor, I would appreciate it, otherwise I'll try to get to it sometime in the next couple days.

This was my bad (I did the ftp parts of this branch) -- I bumped into the bug in
the first hunk while updating test_ftp, and improved the nearby "Blah" while I
was at it :)

Jonathan and I both came up with essentially the same fix for this.  He's just
committed mine to the trunk in r16583.

Thanks for spotting this.

No idea about the half-close test, though...

Subject: [Twisted-Python] PB v XMLRPC v CORBA v SOAP
Message-ID: <443A335C.6000204@BrendanSimon.com>

I have the following application in mind.
    1. Using a Configuration Management System that only runs on UNIX.
    2. Write an application for Windows to remotely connect to the UNIX 
host and perform commands.
    3. Optionally add a GUI (wxPython) to the application.

The CMS has a command to output XML of parts of its internal database 
which will make it easy to display the info in a client app :)  For me 
the question is how do I get the info to/from the CMS on a remote 
server.  I think writing a small server app to interpret my requests and 
relay the XML output to the client is the answer.

I want to use SSH which is how I got onto Twisted (Conch) though I do 
realise that Paramiko is available too.  I also want to make use of rsync.

Reading some Python books, suggested  technologies are Twisted's 
Perspective Broker, XMLRPC, CORBA and also SOAP is mentioned.

CORBA seems like overkill for my simple server.
SOAP I don't know enough about yet.
XMLRPC seems very appropriate.
PB seems easy enough too.

One big question for me is portability, such that other clients written 
in other languages could access the same data.  I'm thinking that all 
technologies would have this property _except_ for PB.  Is that 
correct?  i.e. could a C, perl or ruby application access my server if 
the server was written using Twisted PB ???

If not would anyone recommend SOAP or XMLRPC instead??

Also, it would be nice if I could use any transport mechanism to send 
the commands.  eg. http, https, ssh, rsh.  Can Twisted be used to

XMLRPC be better choices, or is the question of transport irrelevant.

I was thinking of creating my own XML files to request information from 
my server.  Is this the way to go, or am I recreating the wheel?

PB support outside of Python is pretty minimal. I believe there may be a
Java implementation still floating around somewhere, but I'm not sure
how up to date it is, or whether it is even still functional.

I would recommend transferring plain custom XML documents over HTTP,
rather than introducing an extra layer of pain with SOAP or XML-RPC.

I believe SOAP and XML-RPC are only defined over HTTP (including https,
because that's more or less an extra layer underneath it). I'm not sure
there's any value in transmitting SOAP/XML-RPC XML documents over
something like ssh.

I was exactly in the same situation last month :-)

My thoughts:

CORBA ist quite nice, wide spreaded, but more work to implement.

PB ist quite nice, at least twisted only spreaded, but easy to implement.

XML-RPC is included with Python. SOAP is much better the way data types and other things are handled, but not part of Python. Both are easy to use. Twisted favour is SOAPpy and that is build the (pythonic) way like "xmlrpclib".

I use both, but I built the services and the clients that way, that I can change between XML-RPC and SOAP. I need XML-RPC, because one service is located on a Windows 98 machine and I want to reduce complexity out there :-)

For a more formal approach to "XML documents over HTTP" doing in a sane 
fashion what SOAP/XML-RPC wants to achieve:

With Twisted you can easily roll your own RESTive interface.

Message-ID: <d06a5cd30604100547y49455c66v6b6b589fdc267501@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I've recently merged a branch that removes twisted.trial.util.wait
along with all uses of wait() from our tests (paypal details below
;)). Thought it might be a good time to let people know what I'm
thinking with Trial. (By the way, thanks very much to everyone who
helped with that branch.)

There are four major changes / refactorings that I am planning on seeing done:

1. Become a real Twisted application
(http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TrialDevNotes)
Essentially, make Trial's TestSuite expect tests to return Deferreds. 
More at the reference.

2. Trial Reactor (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/1334)
Jp has indicated that this is the best way for Trial to do cleanup
after each test.

3. Log Sanity (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/1409)
Rather than using log._startKeepingErrors or whatever it is called,
use a log observer to keep logged errors and report them as errors
when the test is done.  Provide APIs for altering the list of errors
that have been logged in the test.

4. Split up TestCase
Ideally, I'd like to split out the special case stuff in TestCase that
handles TestCase subclasses that use setUpClass.

I'm intending to work on 1 at the sprint. However, I think we need to
remove the remaining reactor.iterate calls for it to work.

All of these changes involve non-trivial refactoring and should make
Trial less bad.  Once they are made, my role as maintainer will
(hopefully!) slip into fixing bugs, improving docs and adding features
that I'm excited about.

How you can help:
- Money doesn't help so much. If you want, you can buy me curry. Or a
gym membership, to work off all that curry. Paypal is jml at mumak.net.
There are probably better ways you could help Twisted with your money.
- Pairing helps a lot. Come to Tassie.
- Remove calls to reactor.iterate()
- Help me do 2.

cheers,
jml

I don't believe that there is.  It strikes me that it is a documentation bug, either that there isn't such a document, or that it is hard to find.  Someone want to correct me before I file it?

It seems that the 127.*.*.* range is considered a valid multicast

(and no documentation or mention of it online). Other addresses do
properly fail.

I do not think that anything that SOAP wants to achieve could be

More seriously, REST and SOAP/XML-RPC really are different beasts; REST
is about "state transfer", SOAP and XML-RPC are mainly about RPC-style
semantics. Of course, SOAP also has a "document style" form in which you
embed a custom XML document in a wad of pointless SOAP wrapping, which
confuses things.

Unfortunately, in my experience, the most popular choice is also the
most brain-damaged: an RPC-style SOAP interface with a single method
containing a single string parameter (well, maybe a username and
password too; basic auth must be too hard to understand) that contains a
custom XML document...

(If you hadn't guessed, I'm just a little bitter about all this *g*)

> With Twisted you can easily roll your own RESTive interface.

Indeed.

Is there another private range that properly fails?  If so, would you mind creating a ticket for this...? :)

Moe,

I've been trying to use your oscardemo.minimal.py, but it doesn't seem 
to work for me -- I launch it, and it asks for my AIM username & 
password, but after I provide them I don't see my AIM user show up on my 
buddy list (I'm logged in via IM client as another user, to test the 
script).  When I run oscardemo.py, though, it connects fine.

Is there something I have to do to oscardemo.minimal.py before it's 
runnable?  Or am I misunderstanding the way Words works (i.e. it is 
connected, but you need to do something more to have the bot show up on 
people's buddy lists)?

Message-ID: <fa8579a40604120030q19b3d377r152d1af9164ae0d5@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a question about how Exceptions are handled by PB.

I am using Twisted to expose a python object (wrapped into a Twisted
Service) over a couple of network protocols (PB and XML-RPC).  I am
using interfaces/components/adapters to adapt my service into entities
that each protocol can use:

class IPerspectiveFunction(Interface):

    def remote_function(self, x):

class PerspectiveFunctionFromService(pb.Root):

    implements(IPerspectiveFunction)

    def __init__(self, service):
        self.service = service

    def remote_function(self, x):
        return self.service.function(x)     # The service returns a Deferred

self.service.function returns a Deferred, whose errbacks are fired
when an Exception is raised in self.service.function.

Here is my dilemma:

- The code in self.service.function that raises exceptions is in
another library that doesn't know about Twisted.  Thus the exceptions
are not sublcasses of pb.Error.

- Even if I did have control over these exceptions, I wouldn't want to
subclass pb.Error as I need to propagate the errors out to other (not
PB) protocols.

- I would like to detect certain types of exceptions (maybe using
trap()) and convert them to instances of pb.Error (or a subclass) so I
can send them over the line using PB.

The following almost works:

    def remote_function(self, x):
        d = self.service.function(x)     # The service returns a Deferred
        def transformFailure(f):
            return failure.Failure(pb.Error(f.printTraceback()))
        d.addErrback(transformFailure)
        return d

The other side gets the Error just fine, but the PB server still
prints the traceback and says "Peer will receive following PB
traceback:"  Why does PB handle it this way, when the Failure instance
that PB gets contains a pb.Error exception?

Any thoughts on how to transform general Failure instances to ones
that can be handled in a clean way by PB?  I guess there is amore
general question of how to transform Failure instances into things
that can be handled by various network protocols (such as XML-RPC or
even HTTP)

Thanks in advance.

Brian

How does this work if currently a project chooses a specific reactor
because that's what the tests need ?

For example, some of our UI unit tests use the gtk2reactor/glib2reactor
because otherwise they can't run.  Same for some of our GStreamer-using
tests, which need a glib main loop.

Maybe whatever trial needs can be implemented as an IReactorIface or a
mixin instead ?

If some of your tests are reliant on one reactor, and some of them on
another, then you can't run them both in the same process even now. You will
have to specify the reactor globally, just as always.


Oh, now I think I know what you mean: "Is the Trial reactor only compatible
with the select reactor?"? As I understand it, the idea is to make it a
wrapper around whatever other reactor you globally choose.

I'm not sure what Cooperate actually does but if you just want to put a
deferredGenerator to sleep for some period of time then something like
this (untested) should work:

    seconds = 5
    d = defer.Deferred()
    reactor.callLater(seconds, lambda: d.callback(None))
    d = defer.waitForDeferred(d)
    yield d
    d.getResult()

That's ugly, but pulling the first 3 or 4 lines of that into a function
would tidy it up a lot.

I'm not sure to understand this:

Message-ID: <443FF4CD.3090509@libero.it>

Hi.

I would like to have a function be called at the very end of the reactor
lifetime.

I have tried with the statement in the subject, where self.logout sends
a packet via UDP (self is an instance of a class derived from
DatagramProtocol).

But this seems to be not allowed.
I obtain:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "...\twisted\python\log.py",  line 53, in callWithLogger

File "...\twisted\internet\protocol.py", line 490, in doStop

This means, in short, that in a shutdown event I can't use the reactor?
I think that this should be documented.

The docstring should actually read:

Services or the underlying APIs they rely on (addSystemEventTrigger) are the correct way to go about this.

You can, and many applications do.  Perhaps you have found a bug, or perhaps you are using system event triggers improperly.  Could you post a minimal, complete example which will reproduce this behavior?

Ok, thanks.
But why the docstring don't say this or, better, why do not remove it
from the interface?


There are some other cases of this?

Sure!
My system is Windows XP SP2, Python 2.4.3, Twisted 2.2.0


##########
import sys

from twisted.python import log

from twisted.internet.protocol import DatagramProtocol
from twisted.internet import defer, reactor


class Server(DatagramProtocol):
    def datagramReceived(self, data, addr):
        print "server: received from %s:%d" % addr, data
        self.transport.write("LOGGED OUT", addr)


class Client(DatagramProtocol):
    def __init__(self):
        self.deferred = defer.Deferred()

    def startProtocol(self):
        self.transport.connect("127.0.0.1", 9000)

        reactor.addSystemEventTrigger("before", "shutdown", self.logout)

    def connectionRefused(self):
        print "unable to connect"

    def datagramReceived(self, data, addr):
        print "client: received from %s:%d" % addr, data
        self.deferred.callback(data)

    def logout(self):
        self.transport.write("LOGOUT")

        return self.deferred



reactor.listenUDP(9000, Server())
reactor.listenUDP(0, Client())

reactor.callLater(2, reactor.stop)

log.startLogging(sys.stdout)
reactor.run()

#############



The problem seems to be with the response.
There are no problems if logout does not return a deferred (but in this
case the client does not sees the LOGGED OUT response).


Is this an improper use of system event triggers?



Thanks and regards  Manlio Perillo

Subject: [Twisted-Python] .tap and twistd and persistence
Message-ID: <6fb6dbfe0604141556w105845d5w4f77782847cd0663@mail.gmail.com>

I've been using twisted for a couple of years, and am re-writing my
application yet-again to make it even more twisty, so I'm trying to use the
persistence mechanisms that come from services and applications, and I have
hit a snag.

I've conformed my application to the details of the tutorial in the docs
(and I see the demonstrated method of making a 'plugin' is deprecated, and I
get that message after registering my app and running mktap).

First question:
The deprecation warning tells me to look in twisted.plugin... but I don't
see much in the way of docs in there. Where can I learn what I should do?

Second question:
Even though I'm using a fresh Twisted 2.2, installed from the tarball, I
don't have any manpages... not for mktap or twistd, so the docs tell me to
look in the manpage, but I can't (I'm on Ubuntu Breezy, FWIW). I see the man
files themselves in my twisted source distribution, but they don't appear to
be installed when I install twisted.

Third question:
I'm able to make a .tap file, run it, and send it ^C to shut it down. I get
the [app]-shutdown.tap file, but when I try to run that file with 'twistd -f
wrangler-shutdown.tap' I get a problem with the re-building of my objects.
There's an attribute error, from one of the classes that's a part of my
application.

Do I have to write my application in some way to get it to persist and
unpersist properly? There's nothing in my app that isn't pickle-able... it's
just instances and dictionaries, nothing like open files or database
connections.

Thanks!

Hi,

I installed Twisted_NoDocs-2.1.0.win32-py2.4.exe. The installer seems to
have put a couple of broken shortcuts on my start menu pointing to a
directory TwistedDocs that doesn't exist. For example:

C:\Python24\lib\site-packages\TwistedDocs\howto\index.xhtml

The real question though is: where can I download the HTML documentation for
this release?

Hi again!

I have started to use deferredGenerator:


from twisted.internet import defer, reactor


def waitFor(seconds):
    """It would be nice to have this in twisted.internet.defer.
       Thanks to Matt Goodall.
    """

    d = defer.Deferred()
    reactor.callLater(seconds, lambda: d.callback(None))

    return defer.waitForDeferred(d)


@defer.deferredGenerator
def generator():
    d = defer.waitForDeferred(defer.succeed(1))
    yield d

    d = defer.waitForDeferred(defer.fail(Exception("error 1")))
    yield d

#    raise Exception("error 2")

    yield waitFor(3)

    d = defer.waitForDeferred(defer.succeed(2))
    yield d



def callback(result=None):
    print result


def errback(reason):
    print reason


g = generator()
g.addCallbacks(callback, errback)
reactor.run()



The "problem" is that my errback is never called.
Is this a limitation of the deferred Generators?

You want to getResult() the result from waitFor().



    d = defer.waitForDeferred(defer.succeed(2))

    yield d


You want to getResult() the result from waitForDeferred.

getResult() is the thing that (either returns a result or) raises any
exceptions that a Deferred has failed with, so it's important to always call
it.

hey all...

just dropping a line to see if any of you have noticed a strange  
buglet that i've seen on debian a number of times.

basically, after installing twisted (SVN trunk, not a package), when  
i use apt for various other things, i'll get this error:

[jupiter:~/WebServer/jupiter.bubblehouse.org] phil% sudo apt-get  
install trac
Reading Package Lists... Done

this isn't a big deal, because i can just go in and edit the file,  
removing what appears to be simply three question-marks, but i  
thought this was pretty strange. it's doesn't seem to be in the  
original source in SVN, and i've noticed this occurring on both  
Debian and Ubuntu, on various servers.

it obviously doesn't seem like a Twisted problem, but I can't think  
of what could be happening here...I've seen this on well-travelled  
installations like my server, as well as on freshly-installed  
machines at work.

just wondering if anyone else has encountered this...

It _is_ in the original source in SVN, and that file appears to be unused.
It was committed by exarkun in revision 16374 with the commit message
"mumble". I guess it should be removed, unless it *is* serving some
purpose...

Actually, someone should finish it, since there is otherwise no test coverage of halfclose stdio.

I don't have any insight on your particular problems, but the wisdom of the 
list seems to be that the automatic persistence features are not intended for 
production-grade applications, but rather for debugging and development.  
Most authors I'd trust have stated that you're better off to save your state 
yourself on shutdown rather than rely upon the app-shutdown.tap turds.

There has also been debate about whether or not mktap plugins are even a good 
idea at all for new applications.  At any rate, I don't think it receives the 
same attention from the core developers that it once did.  The moral seems to 
be that just because something is provided by Twisted does not mean it's a 
best practice.

Mike.

Ah.  I don't think there is one as of yet. Although if you check out the
subversion repository, most (if not all) of it appears to be in the docs
directory.

It doesn't look like any useful code lives in that file, though - wouldn't it be a better idea to remove it and file a ticket?

Hmm.  This is unfortunate, but since it's unlikely to change soon (many external projects ended up picking up and using bits of Twisted that we ultimately decided are bad ideas) we should probably start documenting "accepted best practices" somewhere.

I suggest a wiki page, linked from the front page, since the idea of "best practice" is an ongoing discussion with some disagreement and some consensus -- probably more appropriate for the wiki format than anything else we are currently using wiki for.

In-Reply-To: 0
Message-ID: <20060416092600.22481.620597867.divmod.quotient.14066@ohm>

As of r16628, 'trial twisted' on a stock win32 twisted installation will actually succeed and give you a PASSED at the end of it.

I went to a lot of trouble to get things into this state, so I would appreciate it if everyone could keep it this way.

More accurately: I will personally revert any changes that cause real failures on win32.  I say "real" failures because (as the buildbot history immediately following this commit amply shows) the win32 buildbot itself seems kind of flaky; some of this may have to do with the slave itself running a released version of Twisted, I'm not sure.  Any other buildbot enforcers / reviewers should be aware that it fails intermittently and give it a few chances to build to make sure the failure is legitimate, especially if the failure is a timeout or a buildbot disconnect.

Finally, I'd like to thank everyone who provided me with help, reviews, commentary, and test fixes to get to this state, especially jerub, exarkun, foom, and jml.

Now, let's get a new release out so we can upgrade that buildbot :).

Hello,

I need to implement a web server with authentication and SSL (so I
guess basic authentication is good enough) and to be able to upload
big files to the server.

Is web2 ready for that (I assume twisted.web is not good for that), if
not is there a new version coming soon (release or CVS head) or can I
add this stuff my self?

thanks

Why do you assume that?

No.  As its only current use-case is documenting twisted, I've been
asking people to file tickets in tm.com's trac and after a few piled
up in the website component, exarkun added a pydoctor component.

Does this bother you somehow?

That makes sense.

Nope.  Just seems like yet another indication that it should really be lore --api ;-)  Or rather, lore, like trial, should be able to take a file (HTML or Python) or module name.

It doesn't and can't really work like that though, pydoctor really
needs to work on a whole system/package at a time.

Thanks for the reply.

So, if the docs tell us that this way is the way to use twisted, and they're
wrong, where do we go to learn how to use twisted?

The docs are quite clear about using application objects and making your
code into a twisted 'plugin' rather than simply poking at the reactor (as in
some of the quick-n-dirty tutorials).

I can certainly write my own persistence code, but I'm a little worried that
more of the "best practices" presented by the docs are wrong. Should I still
use twistd? Should I use the application object? Etc.

Shorter (and somewhat snippier): how do we use twisted in our projects, if
the docs are wrong?

I know that you personally aren't responsible to answer this question; I'm
hoping some others might pipe in and point me to some other docs or other
tutorials.

Thanks.

Looks like someone's slightly ahead of or behind you.  The mktap howto at:

  http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/mktap.html

now reads:

  This document does not describe current Twisted best practice. The progress
  of this document is currently being tracked in issue 1139.

The docs also suggest:

  The majority of users will use the .tac Python configuration files without
  needing to use the mktap serialization.

This is certainly my preferred method, and I think that of most developers.  I 
believe mktap was merely an attempt to expose the same functionality with 
higher-level tools.  But take it with a grain of salt; I'm far, far from the 
inner circle.  I'm just regurgitating lore I've picked up from this list to 
help conserve the attention of the wizards.

> So, if the docs tell us that this way is the way to use twisted, and

Never hurts to ask the list, just as you've done.  I think it's likely your 
questions have already resulted in attempts to improve the situation.

Mike.

Thanks very much.

I had seen that blue-box warning, but stopped reading when I saw it.

Please point us at the docs that are wrong (hopefully in the bug tracker),
and give them the "documentation" keyword.

According to that page:
http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/mktap.html

It's already in the tracker (1139). When I click through, I don't end up
there, but those links have never worked for me. I always get kicked back to
the menu.

It's also hard for us users of the libraries to know how to mark bugs for
things like "this isn't the right way to use twisted" if we don't know what
the right way is.

I like Mike's suggestion, though; to stick with .tac and ditch the
persistence for now.

There is a typo in the URL, it's actually:

  http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/1139

(Typo has been noted in the ticket.)

Absolutely - you are suggesting that the parity is even greater than I am.  'trial twisted' ~= 'lore twisted'.  Or perhaps 'lore zope.interface twisted <something that means the stdlib too>'

One really nice thing that lore could do is look for API references in "howto" documentation (man, that stuff needs a better name) and generate the API documentation concurrently so that it can print warnings if such APIs don't exist.  Of course, by no means impossible if they were separate projects.  Pydoctor generates actually parseable output, as opposed to the crap soup of HTML that comes out of epydoc.

Still, it would be super nice if there could be a single, integrated step for building the whole book in HTML and PDF form, then packaging the API docs into an indexed, annotated appendix, included within the LaTeX document, for example.  That sort of thing seems like it'd be hard to pull off without the code being closely related, however, I guess lore could always just import pydoctor (assuming no pydoctor=>twisted dependency).

It's not actually a typo, it's a broken redirect,
http://twistedmatrix.com/bugs/ redirects unconditionally to
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/report which breaks links to bugs all over
the place, including mailing list archives.  There is a patch attached
to ticket #1517 which fixes this, but I don't know what the status of
that patch is in regards to our website maintainer.

A private message from our website maintainer indicates that certain exigencies have left our website, once again, unmaintained.  :-(

Yep.  Really good question/answer threads are often useful enough to be turned into documentation themselves.  Several of the better Twisted documents, if I recall correctly, were created in just this way.  It always seems easier to reply to an email than to sit down and design a document from scratch.

It seems to me that pydoctor should remain separate -- I suspect it  
would be more useful for other projects if it was not integrated with  
lore.

At the very least, this sort of thing seems to be the sort of thing

I have to apologize for that; .tap plugins, in particular, are my fault.  Sometimes, a system will be written, documented, people will use it for a while, and it will turn out that the supposed benefits of putting up with the pain of a plugin interface or a layer of indirection are actually not worthwhile.  There is chaos for a while as everyone tries to figure out what the best way to solve the problem that the interface originally wanted to solve is.  I wish Twisted didn't have this problem, but it's hardly unique.  The difference is, we admit we have the problem, let our users know we are reconsidering our solution, and attempt to discover the correct way :-).

(For a counterexample, see the web stuff in J2EE.  The XML addicts who designed it refused to admit they were wrong or that the user community was having trouble with the mountains of configuration required, and now the "right" way to use J2EE for Web seems to be ditching it in favor of Ruby on Rails...)

Right now the appropriate thing to do is use a .tac file.  Some of what the documentation says is in fact correct: you still shouldn't poke at the reactor directly: just create the Application object (as documented in those howtos) in a .tac configuration file rather than an axiom plugin.

One of the major enhancements we need to make (this will probably be seen in a Twisted 3.0 release) is to make a publicly-supported version of twisted.scripts.twistd.ServerOptions.  If you are uncomfortable reading grotty platform-specific code and getting into spirited arguments on this mailing list about broken compatibility from release to release, that is not yet the class for you.  Eventually we will provide a nice way to make a twistd-like command-line program (and hopefully also a similar GUI-friendly equivalent) that adds additional arguments and startup logic of your choosing.  However, some projects written by Twisted core team members are already abusing the private ServerOptions interface to provide this same effect.

One such project is something that I wrote, Divmod Axiom ( http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodAxiom ).  Axiom abuses this internal interface to implement a rather nice mechanism that actually accomplishes what .tap plugins set out to do.  Axiom is an object database with native support for the Twisted programming model.  The feature I am talking about specifically here though, is a nifty command-line tool called 'axiomatic'.  Axiomatic provides a plugin architecture, like tap plugins, which perform manipulations on a database, and a "start" sub-command, which allows you to do things like this:

     % axiomatic -d mymantissa.axiom mantissa
     Enter Divmod™ Mantissa™ password for 'admin at localhost':
     Confirm Divmod™ Mantissa™ password for 'admin at localhost':
     % axiomatic -d mymantissa.axiom start -n

The first command would be roughly equivalent to a hypothetical mktap plugin:

    % mktap -a mymantissa.tap mantissa
    % twistd -nf mymantissa.tap

The difference is that Axiom is a real object database, based around SQLite, with support for managed transactions, schema evolution, persistent timed events, and more.  You can therefore put a reasonable amount of real data into it in addition to your configuration.

>I can certainly write my own persistence code, but I'm a little worried that
>more of the "best practices" presented by the docs are wrong. Should I still
>use twistd? Should I use the application object? Etc.

Yes, use twistd.  Yes, use the application object.  You *can* even write mktap plugins; they will work as described by the documentation.  They're not buggy.  (Okay, they're not *very* buggy.)  It's just that the advertised benefits are not really so great so most people don't use them any more.  The ones that come included with Twisted are handy toys.

A separate issue is that if you have large, complex configurations, storing them in pickle (or any automatic persistence mechanism) is dangerous.  A chance upgrade of any Twisted module which your configuration happens to contain instances from, or the standard library, or any other library which Twisted depends on, or any of your code... well, basically if any Python code on your computer changes at all, you could end up with a configuration that won't load.

This isn't really a Twisted-specific issue, but it is a lesson that many Twisted Matrix Labs developers have learned by way of .tap files.  There is a well-written paper on the dangers of automatic persistence here:

   http://www.erights.org/data/serial/jhu-paper/upgrade.html

If you're intrigued by Axiom after reading this, there's good news and bad news.

The good news:  Axiom can provide all the advantages that tap plugins were supposed to, along with a relatively scalable and powerful general persistence mechanism.  The dangers of upgrading are far reduced from .tap files, because (A) axiom includes very good schema migration support and automatic upgrades between released versions, (B) all attributes are explicit, so there are no "hidden surprises" when you upgrade, and (C) only Item objects in the database need to be upgraded, not every random thing you invoke in your code.

The bad news:  Axiom is heavily in development, nowhere near as stable as Twisted.  The 0.4 release is ancient, in terms of available features, and documentation is mainly being written for the main line of development.  Unfortunately there aren't necessarily upgrades beween every random revision of SVN trunk.  In practice there have been relatively few breakages.

However, it sounds like your needs are relatively lightweight and that you could happily use the 0.4 release of Axiom to deploy a real application.  When we do get around to producing a new release, you shouldn't have to worry too much about backwards compatibility.

pydoctor also optionally generates a system pickle with all the
information in, so you shouldn't really even need to parse anything...

pydoctor depends on nevow (practically speaking, anyway; there's a
writer that just builds up HTML by string interpolation but all the
funky new stuff is just in the nevow writer).  It is also vaguely
designed to be used as a library, so I think lore could import it.

Hi,
I have been looking at ways to have postfix talking to my twisted app
and today tried LMTP successfully for the first time. What I've done so
far is just subclass the ESMTP protocol and add do_LHLO which seems to
do the trick for some basic usage at least. Looking at
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2033.txt it seems like it shouldn't be to
hard to make a proper LMTP implementation. Perhaps someone more familiar
with twisted.mail could have a look.


class LMTP(smtp.ESMTP):
    def do_LHLO(self, rest):
        peer = self.transport.getPeer()
        try:
            host = peer.host
        except AttributeError:
            host = str(peer)
        self._helo = (rest, host)
        self._from = None
        self._to = []
        self.sendCode(250, '%s Hello %s, nice to meet you\n%s' %
(self.host, host,self.listExtensions()))

    def do_HELO(self,rest):
        return self.do_UNKNOWN(self,rest)
    def do_EHLO(self,rest):
        return self.do_UNKNOWN(self,rest)

Your mini LMTP implementation fails if a message is sent to several
recipients, since LMTP must answer with a status code per destination.
That is the main difference with SMTP.

But good starting point :)

Hope "somebody" takes the token and complete a RFC compliant
implementation... :-p

I have run into this issue as well when trying to order different
writes and make code run _after_ a write was completed.  I ended up
calling my code using deferToThread and putting in time.sleep calls to
make sure things got ordered correctly.  Ugly hack though.

The ITransport interface docs seem to imply that returning a deferred
from a write is not supported:

I make no representations about whether calls to me will happen
immediately or require returning to a control loop, or whether they
will happen in the same or another thread. Consider methods of this
class (aside from getPeer) to be 'thrown over the wall', to happen at
some indeterminate time.

I echo the question: why doesn't write return a deferred?  Surely
there are times you want to trigger events on the completion of a
write.

The way you do this is to hook up a producer to the transport. Hopefully
there are some references to this in the API docs: search for "producer" and
"consumer".

Eeeeew. Don't do that.

This is (more or less) what the producer API is for. Register a
IConsumer with transport.registerProducer and you will get callbacks
telling you when the transport buffer becomes empty or full.

Returning Deferred from every transport.write would make everything
rather slow... a wrapper that does this could be probably be written
using the producer/consumer API.

Fantastic, I wasn't aware of this API.  I will defintely use this
approach from now on.

Thanks for the pointer.

Wow, thanks for the detailed and thoughful reply.

You've answered my questions and have given me another project to look at.
I'll check out Axiom, thanks.

For the record and the future list, it turned out that the persistence
problem was related to a pretty simple subclass of dict that was not happily
unpickling... but only when the new "protocol 2" was used to pickle/unpickle
objects. That was pretty hard to track down.

But of course, more importantly, I've learned how to do it right from here.

Thanks.

Some folks have already answered with the primary reason, which is to say, efficiency.  While Twisted definitely trades performance for flexibility in a number of places where reasonable, 'write()' is one of those things that just absolutely has to be as fast as possible, because many things which are highly  performance-critical call it.  Creating Deferreds could be 100x faster and it would still be too slow for this case.

There is anothe reason, though: returning a deferred from "write()" implies to the user that when the deferred fires, the bytes have been "written", e.g. the other end has received them.  In cases where .write() blocks, most naive programmers -- and yes, I say this having once been a "naive programmer" myself -- assume that the other end has not only received the bytes, it has processed them.  This is wrong, and can (and often does) have unfortunate consequences.

It sounds like you want control over excessive in-memory buffering, which is a pretty reasonable thing to want, and the IConsumer/IProducer interfaces you have already been directed to should provide that to you quite satisfactorily.

The reality is that when a 'write' completes and returns to userland, your bytes are somewhere between your kernel, your router, your cable modem, your ISP's cable modem, your ISP's internal routers, the backbone (...) your destination's kernel, and your destination's application.  You have no idea where they are, really, and neither does Twisted.  It just hides one more distinction from you: Twisted's buffer to your OS's buffer.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] error "limits.h missing" while compiling zope
 interface in Sumo on mac os x 10.4.6 Py 2.4
Message-ID: <1145468802.19327.259443736@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello Twisted gurus,

Apologies if this is a FAQ - couldn't find answers in the obvious
places. ( list archives, google, ...).

I've been trying to build the TwistedSumo-2006-02-12 package -
especially the ZopeInterface package within, and am getting the
following errors
about limits.h not being found.
This is on Mac OS X 10.4.6 on a PPC powerbook G4 with gcc 4.0, I tried
swicthing to 3.3 via gcc_select and got a different error about gcc
command line switches.
An 'ls' on
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/include/python2.4/
indicates that indeed there's no limits.h there.
Separately downloading earlier stable ZopeInterface version and building
gave exactly the same error.

Python 2.4 is the default python installed via the MacPython 2.4 dmg.
An older Python 2.3 also exists on the system but 2.4 is ahead in the
PATH.

Any help getting past this appreciated.

limits.h is a system header. From the invocation of gcc:

... it looks as if there's something wrong with your /Developer/SDKs/ 
MacOSX10.4u.sdk, since the compiler should be picking up a correct  
limits.h from somewhere in that tree. Is that directory installed on  
your machine? What version of Xcode do you have?

For the API I think you can use "epydoc" and extract it  from the code.
Though it would be great if someone made a tarball of all that documentation
so that
we could download and view it offline.

Hi,
I'm new to twisted and interested in using the ftp client module. But 
apart from the api reference I stumbled across did not find any docs on 
the ftp module. Are there any? It would be helpful if there was a doc 
outlining the use of the module, order in which the various methods 
should be called/not called, example use of the module etc.
 
Twisted looks highly appropriate for my project but without appropriate 
documentation I'm reluctant to use it.
 
Many thanks,
 
John Pote

Ok, I had a closer look and here's a more complete version, that sends a
status code for each recipient. 
Try it out

Kind of a little.  Extremely inconvenient interface, but I've used it to remove the edits.

Those are errors, yes, and they are coming from twisted.web2.  In fact,  
though, they aren't really errors in the sense of "something is broken".   
The problem is that web2 is raising an error rather than just returning a  
"Not Modified" response code.  It is harmless, although I do find it  
annoying myself.

Not sure what the fix would be; perhaps one of the web2 devs could opine  
on that?

Hope this helps,

Subject: [Twisted-Python] t.w jabber client question
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0604201501020.2597@akrherz-laptop.agron.iastate.edu>

Hi,

I am getting my feet wet with Twisted Words Jabber and have hit a wall. 
Here is my code:

from twisted.words.protocols.jabber import client, jid
from twisted.words.xish import domish
from twisted.internet import reactor

def sendMessage(factory, body):
     message = domish.Element(("jabber:client","message"))
     message['to']   = "me at myserver.com"
     message.addElement('body', content = body)
     message.addElement('subject', content ="Test")

     # What goes here?
     #factory.please_sendme_to_server(message)

myJID = jid.JID('guest at myserver.com/twisted_words')
factory = client.basicClientFactory(myJID, "password")
reactor.connectTCP('myserver.com',5222, factory)
reactor.callLater(5, sendMessage, factory, "Hi there" )
reactor.run()

So my question is how to send a message?  I can't seem to figure it out...

TIA,
   daryl

Hi all

I'm picking up twisted again ( haven't touched it for a while )

Luckily twisted plays great with psycopg2

I really prefer using the dictcursor in psycopg2 though:

does anyone know how to get twisted to utilize it?  i haven't been  
able to figure it out based on docs or google

a non twisted example of what i'm talking about follows
===

import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import extras

class DataBase:
	def __init__(self):
		self.profile = []
		self.db = psycopg2.connect 
( host="localhost",database="db",user="user",password="")
	def get_cursor(self):
		return self.db.cursor( cursor_factory = psycopg2.extras.DictCursor )

I use a "fake" dbapi module that wraps psycopg 2 and import it by giving
its name to the adbapi connection pool. Something like (let's suppose we
put it in a twistedpg.py module):

"""
from psycopg2 import *
from psycopg2 import _psycopg as _2psycopg
from psycopg2.extensions import connection as _2connection
from psycopg2.extras import DictCursor

del connect
def connect(*args, **kwargs):
    kwargs['connection_factory'] = connection
    return _2psycopg.connect(*args, **kwargs)

class connection(_2connection):
    def cursor(self):
        return _2connection.cursor(self, cursor_factory=DictCursor)
"""

Then:

"""
from twisted.enterprise import adbapi

mypool = adbapi.ConnectionPool("twistedpg", database="xxx", ...)
"""

Hope this helps,
federico

actually, i spoke too soon.

   i thought i was getting a dict, but it appears that I'm not.

i think it works for accessing a cursor directly, but i can't seem to  
get it to work with a ConnectionPool and deferred return

i definitely see twistedpd.connection.cursor called (for the dict  
cursor), but i can't trace to where its being used.

any suggestion ?  and thanks for pointing me to this direction so far.

I really don't know. It works perfectly here. Maybe show us our code and
how the pool is called.

good idea.  i'm kind of stressed out today - not thinking very  
clearly.  i'm probably dealing with a typo that i'm just not seeing.

i was using this w/twisted words, but i just copied the lines to  
replicate into the stub basic reactor .

Newby alert.

I am starting off with the "Twisted Mail Tutorial: Building an SMTP
Client from Scratch"
(http://twistedmatrix.com/users/warner/doc-latest/mail/tutorial/smtpclient/smtpclient.html#auto8).


I would like to send an attachment with my email. I presume I do this
through the sendEmail function but how to achieve is beyond me at the
moment. :-(

TIA.

Here is the code I use (to send PGN files, which are just text 
files). If you want to send images or binary files, you need to 
change the way pgn_part is constructed.

from email import Encoders
from email.Message import Message
from email.MIMEBase import MIMEBase
from email.MIMEMultipart import MIMEMultipart
#from email.MIMEImage import MIMEImage
from email.MIMEText import MIMEText

class EmailSender:
    def __init__(self, from_addr, smtp_host, 
                 smtp_user = None, smtp_password = None):
        self.from_addr = from_addr
        self.smtp_host = smtp_host
        self.smtp_user = smtp_user
        self.smtp_password = smtp_password
    def sendPGN(self, to_addr_list, subject, pgn,
                intro_text = None, 
                preamble = 'Some preamble', 
                epilogue = 'Some epilogue',
                attachment_name = 'attachmentname'):
        msg = MIMEMultipart()
        msg['Subject'] = subject
        msg['From'] = self.from_addr
        msg['To'] = ", ".join(to_addr_list)
        msg.preamble = preamble
        msg.epilogue = epilogue
        if intro_text:
            msg.attach( MIMEText(intro_text, 'plain') )
        pgn_part = MIMEBase('text', 'plain')
        pgn_part.set_payload(pgn)
        #Encoders.encode_base64(pgn)
        pgn_part.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment', 
filename=attachment_name+'.pgn')
        msg.attach(pgn_part)
        deferred = smtp.sendmail(self.smtp_host, self.from_addr, 
to_addr_list, msg.as_string())
        return deferred

Message-ID: <200604251132.21710.rudy@goldenhelix.com>

Hey guys,

In a few specific cases (not as a general case) I'm sending a significant list 
of items over pb in a pb.RemoteCache/pb.Cacheable object pair. To give you an 
idea, it's a list of ~4000 tuples where each tuples has about ~10 strings of 
~10 length.

Right now twisted works fine, but takes about 10 seconds to 
serialize/send/unserialize the data, or I guess in twisted terms, 
banana/send/recv/banana the data.

Since my list is all primitives I thought maybe pickling it before sending 
would speed it up as banana would have to do less work, but I get a 

twisted.spread.banana.BananaError: string is too long to send (706378)

Is that an arbitrary length limit or technically significant?

Is there other methods of speeding this up?

Or alternatively, is it possible (within pb) to receive the state of  a 
RemoteCache or RemoteObject in definable chunks (say 100 items from the list 
at a time), allowing me to start displaying the data in my UI and adding more 
to it as it comes async?

Thanks,
--gabe

Slowness of PB with big data is a known problem, the situation should have
gotten better with newpb. Look at this thread:

Ah come on! Since when have we been limiting ourselves the the

I'm not sure how you are using RemoteCache, but the general technique here is to use a pager.  Take a look at twisted.spread.util.Pager, and the two examples/tools that come with it, StringPager and FilePager.

Very nice, I think that will be very usefull. It may put some holes in my 
abstraction with the current way I use RemoteCache, but I could imagine some 
design changes that would work.

Here is the idea I might try (if you care to comment)

Background: RemoteCachedTable represents some table view of a server-side 
database, thus on the client side it might go something like this (very 
simplified and NOT TESTED):

from twisted.spread import pb, util
class TableDataCollector(util.CallbackPageCollector):
    def __init__(self):
        self.table = None

    def remote_gotPage(self, page):
        self.table.data.extend(page)
        self.table.updateUi(False)

    def remote_endedPaging(self):
        self.table.updateUi(True)

class RemoteCachedTable(pb.RemoteCache):
   def setCopyableState(self,state):
        self.headers = state['headers']
        self.dataIsSmall = state['dataIsSmall']
        if self.dataIsSmall: #Ship the table data if its small, <100 rows
            self.data = state['data']
        else: #We receive the data through a Pager/Collector
            self.data = []
            self.collector = state['collector'] #A TableDataCollector instance
            self.collector.table = self

   def updateUi(self, finished):
        pass #Notify UI of changes to self.data

   #various observe_* methods go here

Obviously the server side stuff is not shown, but this depicts my intent :)

I don't think I have that right though. The "Server" here can not create the 
TableDataCollector instance and pass it back with the state dictionary can 
it? Somehow my "Client" needs to create the instance and send it to the 
server, at which point the server creates the StringPager (or TablePager), 
eh?

I'd bug the mailing list (or possibly IRC channel) for reviewers.
Unfortunately, nagging seems to be a necessarily evil to get your patch heard
sometimes.  I can't speak for all the developers, but I don't mind being nagged
because I realise this.  Well, I don't mind much <wink>.

Also, I think you should unassign the ticket from yourself seeing as there's
nothing for you to do to it at the moment (although this alone isn't likely make
much difference, we just don't have enough people looking over unassigned
issues).  You could try assigning to developers at random (glyph thinks this is
a good idea), but I don't think this really works very well -- e.g. I just spent
over a week not looking at the internet at all, let alone the issue tracker, so
things randomly assigned to me wouldn't have got anywhere.

This is my resignation as Twisted's lead documentation person.

Rest assured I'm not resigning due to any subset of: burning

Rather, I have a bundle of other projects, and they're increasingly
unrelated to Twisted, which means that I'm not using it for my own

into an unrelated project enough to lead part of it.

I'm also, as it turns out, much more interested in reviewing and/or

that I'll continue to make myself available as a reviewer of
documentation patches and/or an editor, if needed. Feel free to assign
bugs on this basis. (I will probably not be reading the mailing list,
but I don't make myself difficult to find on IRC.) I will unassign other
bugs from myself soon.

This obviously leaves gaping holes in the greater Twisted universe for
people anxious to advertise the glory of Twisted to the admiring masses.
Do submit some documentation patches... It also leaves a vacancy for

I've maintained Planet Jabber and Planet FOSDEM for a while now. It

Mary, this Twisted user for one really appreciates the efforts you've
put forth. Indeed, as one of the biggest complainers about Twisted's
docs, I probably appreciate those efforts more than many users. (That
sounds backwards until you think about it for a while, like a lot of
legal language.)

I'm thinking about suggesting (gasp!) myself as your replacement. The
logical, responsible part of my brain is telling me that I'm insane for
doing this. But there's another part of my brain that has an illogical,
probably unhealthy fascination with Twisted and is raising its hand and
squirming on the uncomfortable wooden schooldesk chair with those huge
uncomfortable screw heads sticking out, yelling "Call on me! Call on me!"

As a registered patent agent (http://eepatents.com), I do a lot of
writing as part of my work and bill quite a bit per hour for doing so.
(Here that logical, responsible part is screaming, "So WHY do you want
to do more writing for FREE?") I have complained and whined about the,
shall we say "mixed," state of Twisted's docs for years now on #twisted
and am intrigued by the idea of putting my mouth (dictation) where my
mouth (complaints) is. Plus, (branch) commit access would be kind of
cool for writing those docstrings where I just can't stand seeing those
glaring holes right below "def" or "class"...

It goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway) that there is and would
be absolutely no professional relationship between me and the Twisted
project. (Most free software types aren't all that enamored with
patents, anyhow...) I have kind of enjoyed the decidedly unprofessional
relationship that has developed on #twisted, though.

Comments welcome. Any positive ones will likely be viewed with suspicion
and will raise pangs of regret at my making this rash posting. The
negative ones will likely be viewed with relief, at least by the
aforementioned logical, responsible part...

Best regards,

Ed Suominen

Thank you for communicating this. I really like when it happens to

debugging gcc assembler output looking for compiler bugs before noting
an unitialized variable. :D

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Twisted's ability to handle many open connections.
Message-ID: <17487.57970.85904.437295@terry.jones.tc>

I'm completely new to Twisted. As I understand it, a Twisted server runs as
a single process - no forking, no threads. To me that implies that select
(or poll or pselect, etc) is being heavily used to feed data to Deferreds.

If that's the case, how does Twisted (portably) allow for a large number of
file descriptors?

I'm considering using Twisted for a project. Twisted would front requests
from the web, but also from (e.g.) remote command line applications via an
API.  These latter connections could potentially be numerous, and long
lived.  Should I be thinking about how Twisted deals with this, or does it
already scale to allow more simultaneous connections / file descriptors
than a naive server program would be able to maintain?

Given what looks like widespread use of Deferreds in Twisted, I suppose
that there is not a 1-1 relationship between connections and file
descriptors? If so this makes the issue more pressing.

Thanks for any help,
Terry

That's more or less accurate.  It sounds like you understand this, but because I can never repeat it enough: Deferreds don't do anything magic or get involved with select() directly, it's just that their callback() methods are called from other callbacks which are ultimately invoked as a result of the return value of select().

>If that's the case, how does Twisted (portably) allow for a large number of

Twisted doesn't do *anything* portably :).

On Windows, there is a reactor that supports a maximum of 63 concurrent events (assuming your process has no windows open).  On UNIX the default reactor is still select() based and will definitely bog down if you have too many simultaneous sockets open.  Sometimes it is handled quite badly!

However, the selection of a reactor is a configuration option, not an application-architecture issue (unless, of course, you are writing a GUI which has requirements for what event loop it will run on).

You can choose a reactor with the -r argument to twistd, trial, and other similar tools like axiomatic.  You can choose different reactors for different platforms.  Application code should be none the wiser.

There are some pretty darn naive programs out there.  The default naive case of a server that I'm aware of accept()s one connection, reads (blocking) the entire socket, then writes a response.  That is 1 simultaneous connection: so in that case, yes, Twisted can do better :).  However, it doesn't use any crazy tricks, and is likely to scale far worse than something like ACE or Sandstorm, i.e. any research project designed specifically just to scale.  Scale is only one of Twisted's many considerations, as it aims to be a completely generic networking application layer.

The most scalable reactor you are likely to find on UNIX is the "poll" reactor.  There is a kqueue reactor but it is by all accounts terrible (ie, performs worse than poll due to unfortunate design decisions in the python/kqueue bindings) and needs to be rewritten.  In every case I'm aware of, other scalability concerns (usually the speed of Python itself) was an issue long before the IO overhead of simultaneous connections broke poll().  If your application has such a case, though, implementing an epoll, aio, kqueue, libevent, or <insert your totally non-portable, OS-specific, crazily scalable IO multiplexing API here> reactor should not be an inordinate amount of work.  Less work, at least, than building such a beast and then writing what amounts to 2/3 of the Twisted core around it anyway :).

Again, Deferreds do not create file descriptors or have anything to do with select().  They are simply a Python object abstraction for callbacks.

Depends what you mean by 'connections'.  listenTCP, listenUNIX, etc, create a listening socket.  They accept() on that, and each buildProtocol is invoked after a connected socket is created.  Each of those is a file descriptor.  If you keep disk files or pipes open outside of Twisted, those are also file descriptors, etc etc etc.  You can have virtual "connections" which multiplex  multiple Protocol objects over a single transport though, or otherwise have fewer file descriptors than "connections" in that sense.

Correct. Twisted is event driven. It doesn't need to fork and spawn 
threads to handle a lot of network connections at once.

However, Twisted is perfectly capable of managing any processes and 
threads an application *needs* to create. In fact, Twisted's core 
includes APIs specifically created to handle background processes and 
threads.


> To me that implies that select
> (or poll or pselect, etc) is being heavily used to feed data to Deferreds.

select/poll/whatever is at the core of Twisted's event loop, known as 
the 'reactor' but Deferreds are completely unrelated to data delivery.

A Deferred is a callback mechanism, nothing more. A function typically 
returns a Deferred to say, "hey, you asked me to do something and I will 
give my response ... just not right now".

As you recognised, Twisted uses a select loop so I'm not quite sure what 
your question means. However ...

Twisted chooses the best available reactor implementation for the 
platform. "Best", here, probably meaning most available (default?) 
rather than fastest.

I'm no expert here but on Linux the reactor really does use a select() 
loop, on win32 it uses the win32 equivalent of a select loop 
(WSAEventSelect and MsgWaitForMultipleObjects, or something), and I 
believe it uses poll on the BSDs.

If the "best" reactor is not actually the best (if you see what I mean!) 
then you can manually install a non-default reactor. There are plenty to 
choose from.

For instance, on Linux if you want to handle a huge number of 
simultaneous connections then installing a poll-based reactor is 
probably a good idea. If your application uses GTK+ then you would 
install a GTK+ reactor.

This is what Twisted excels at - multi-protocol network applications. 
I've done it many times now and it just works.

Twisted already includes support (of varying quality) for most common 
protocols but it's very easy to add new protocols if necessary.

Twisted is event driven and most people believe that event driven scales 
better, especially for network-related work. I therefore believe Twisted 
will *help* you write code that will scale to a high number of 
simultaneous connections. Twisted does perform any magic though.

You will need to understand event driven programming to scale up, 
otherwise you're likely to block the application from doing more than 
one thing at a time (in the cooperatively multitasking sense) making 
your application utterly unscalable.

Also, note that Twisted does not magic away other common problems 
associated with scalability. The obvious one that springs to mind 
(because it bit me recently :-/) is the maximum number of file 
descriptors a non-root Linux process can open per process.

There is absolutely a 1-1 relationship between connections and file 
descriptors but Deferred have nothing to do with it.

It's quite possible to write a Twisted application without ever using a 
Deferred. If your application can respond immediately (well, very 
quickly) to requests that arrive from the network then you don't need 
Deferreds.

You need a Deferred when you cannot respond immediately. In that case 
you would create a Deferred and store it somewhere, spawn something 
*non-blocking* to handle the request and return the Deferred to the 
caller. Then, when the non-blocking thing completes, you callback via 
the Deferred you stored to let the caller know the result.

Ok, great. I'm actually backing my way out of using lots of already written

and agree.

I think that, oddly enough, Mary's resignation comes because she was the most dilligent member of the team, taking her documentation-maintenance responsibilities more seriously than almost anyone else over the packages they maintain (myself included).

No need to insist - with the level of competition we usually have, you're in!

The position of "documentation maintainer" is a bit unusual since it was actually taken consciously and willingly.  Usually the protocol is this: I appoint someone for a task, which they are not qualified to do.  Then, they have to fight a bear if they don't want to do it.

Now that you've volunteered, there's no getting out of it.  I mean, do you want to fight a bear?  I wouldn't.  Bears are *scary* - just ask Stephen Colbert.

Well, I guess you could consider my comment positive.  I think you'll do a great job, since few people seem to care so much about documentation.

By the way, do you know anyone who might be similarly duped into becoming the website maintainer?  (might you?)

OK.

Yes. Plus, it's nice to see how quickly a mailing list reacts when you're
thinking of using a new product :-) Twisted has a bit of a reputation for
being obscure, but it looks much better to me than any alternative - at
least for serious networking tasks (not just serving web pages fished up of
the nearest database). I have high hopes.

Anyway, thanks again.

Just to known.
Suppose I found some time to document some parts of Twisted.
Many things in twisted.python are undocumented, log is rougly documented
and usage docs are not really complete.

I have to submit a ticket/patch?


By the way: here are some parts for witch I would like to see documentation:
1) twisted.python
2) description of design patterns used in twisted
3) all(?) interfaces, like IConsumer

4) parts of twisted deprecated/unmaintained/abandoned/not to be used
5) parts of twisted that need recoding (twisted.news?)
6) servers used in production enviroment with use cases



Thanks and regards  Manlio Perillo

This kind of information should be submitted as a bug at
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/newticket and marked as belonging to the
'website' component. (I tended to prefer each individual problem be
filed as a separate bug, this mail sounds like two bugs.)

This would be the usual way to do it. I used to accept some through
email to, but that just adds another step for the person you mail them
to: they file a bug based on your mail. I had a post about what made a
good docs bug here:
http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2004-June/008071.html

Each of these sounds like a bug report, whether or not you attach a

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Naming test methods constructed with
	deferredGenerator - is it possible?
Message-ID: <200604281414.35595.Marcin.Kasperski@softax.com.pl>

In my trial tests I have a few test methods constructed using 
deferredGenerator idiom. Something like that:

  def testSomething(self):
       # ... do something
       yield defer.waitForDeferred(someDeferred)
       # ... do something
       yield defer.waitForDeferred(otherDeferred)
       # ... do something
  testSomething = defer.deferredGenerator(testSomething)

Let's write clean code and works perfectly.    ... Almost.
The problem is that in the verbose test output I get 

      <lambda> ...                        [OK]

Of course I would prefer

     testSomething ...                   [OK]

Is it possible to name the function returned by deferredGenerator 
somehow? If not, how to solve this situation? Extra problem is 
that if I add sth like 'def testSomethingWrapped(self):' calling 
generator inside, then trial will consider both testSomethign 
and testSomethingWrapped as independed test methods...

Shot in the dark; try adding:

    testSomething.__name__ = "testSomething"

or

    testSomething.__doc__ = "testSomething"

Not pretty, but I think it will work.  You could maybe use a util func like:

def defGen(f):
  gen = defer.deferredGenerator(f)
  gen.__name__ = f.__name__
  gen.__doc__ = f.__doc__
  return gen

I think this may be fixed in twisted 2.2.

I use the following replacement for the standard twisted sendmail function:

from twisted.mail import smtp
from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.internet import defer

try:
    from cStringIO import StringIO
except ImportError:
    from StringIO import StringIO

def sendmail_auth(smtphost, user, password,
                 from_addr, to_addrs, msg, senderDomainName=None, port=25):
    if not hasattr(msg,'read'):
        msg = StringIO(str(msg))
    d = defer.Deferred()
    factory = smtp.ESMTPSenderFactory(user, password, from_addr, to_addrs, msg, d,
                                      requireTransportSecurity=False)
    if senderDomainName is not None:
        factory.domain = senderDomainName
    reactor.connectTCP(smtphost, port, factory)
    return d

(nothing wise, just copied original and changed to ESMTPSenderFactory). Maybe it would make sense to add something like that to twisted.

Finally such one does the job:

def createDeferredGenerator(function):
    gen = defer.deferredGenerator(function)
    gen.__doc__ = function.__name__
    return gen

My Debian claims that I am using 2.2.0, so maybe it was patched 
later.

I guess that the fix would be adding within deferredGenerator 
construct like the one suggested by Mike (setting __doc__ of 
returned lambda function to __name__ of wrapped function)

This isn't correct, of course.  It just happens to do something kind of useful when the deferred generator is a trial test method.  In other cases, it would be weird to find the __doc__ of the returned object to be the __name__ of the wrapped function.

In Python 2.4, setting __name__ works, and deferredGenerator tries to do that, so trial will only have this problem with Python 2.3.  You could define a helper function for your tests which calls deferredGenerator and sets __doc__ appropriately, if switching to Python 2.4 isn't an option.

It seems the appropriate rituals have performed and Ed is now the lead
documentation maintainer for Twisted. So they should be assigned to him,
but I don't know what his bugtracker login is.

I think it's possible not to assign tickets to anyone (I don't know trac
very well), so that's the backup plan.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Crash when using XmlRPC during reactor shutdown
Message-ID: <20060429151006.GB16623@natulte.net>

Hi,

I have been experiencing a crash when trying to use the XmlRPC query
subsystem while the reactor is shutting down.

The context of it is that my twisted application talks to an upstream
server using XmlRPC.  When it comes online, it registers, and when it
goes offline, it should unregister itself, using a simple XmlRPC
query.

So, I figured the natural place to put the notifications were in the
startService and stopService methods, that get called at just the
right time.  startService is not a problem, and works fine.  for
stopService, I made the method return the XmlRPC Deferred, so that the
reactor would wait until request completion before continuing the
shutdown.

The thing is, with this scheme Twisted dumps an exception during
shutdown, because the XmlRPC Deferred gets fired twice.  I've
reproduced this behaviour with a minimal application:

****************************************************************
****************************************************************
from twisted.application.service import Service
from twisted.python import log
from twisted.web.xmlrpc import Proxy
from twisted.application.service import Application, IServiceCollection
from twisted.internet import reactor, defer

class TestXmlRpcService(Service):
    def startService(self):
        log.msg("Starting service")
        reactor.callLater(0, reactor.stop)

    def stopService(self):
        def handle_success(res):
            log.msg("Unregistration successful, but reactor will now crash")
            return True
        def handle_error(e):
            log.msg("Unregistration failed...")
            return False

        log.msg("Calling XmlRPC backend (and crashing)")
        p = Proxy('http://natulte.net/pub/fgs/RPC2.php')
        defer.setDebugging(True)
        # Call any old method, this is just a proof of concept
        d = p.callRemote('fgsd.register',
                         "00000000000000000000000000000000",
                         "bleh")
        d.addCallbacks(handle_success, handle_error)
        return d


service = TestXmlRpcService()
application = Application("proxy")
service.setServiceParent(application)
****************************************************************
****************************************************************

If you run that with `twistd -n -l- -y test.tac`, you should see the
crash immediately.

I know that patients shouldn't give diagnostics about their problems
to the doctor, but nevertheless, examining the exception log, I
believe I know what the problem is.

 - When stopService returns a Deferred, the reactor stops the shutdown
   and adds callbacks to the Deferred, to resume shutdown at the right
   time.

 - The XmlRPC query succeeds, and fires the Deferred. It walks right
   down the notification chain, and eventually trips the reactor's
   callback.

 - The reactor, within the callback, resumes shutdown, and calls
   disconnectAll to kill all active connections.

 - At this point, the XmlRPC query still has its socket open, and so
   gets notified that the connection was lost.  It attempts to fire
   our Deferred's errback to notify of this, and foom,
   AlreadyCalledError.

If this makes sense, the resolution might be simple: close the
transport connection before firing the deferred, so that the reactor
can't kill the connection and trigger the double-call.

The other option would be to include a flag in the xmlrpc query
object, to avoid double-firing in this (admitedly corner-case)
situation.

Does all that make sense?  And, of course, does anyone have an idea of
a workaround I could use in the meantime?  As I'm shutting down the
service anyway, the exception is not really a problem in itself, it's
just a little unclean to have an exception dump in the logs at each
shutdown.

Thanks in advance (and already, for Twisted :-),
- Dave.

After a bit more fiddling, I found a functional workaround.  The trick
is indeed to let the xmlrpc Deferred fully terminate *before* the
reactor continues the shutdown, instead of continuing the shutdown
within the Deferred callback.

With that in mind, the new stopService makes the RPC call, but
creates, stores and returns a different Deferred.  The RPC Deferred
gets a callback that calls reactor.callLater to schedule the firing of
the reactor's Deferred in 0 seconds.

That lets the xmlrpc deferred complete and clean up, and immediately
after the reactor schedules its own shutdown callback, and all is
well.

Here is the new stopService code:

****************************************************************
****************************************************************
    def stopService(self):
        def handle_success(res):
            log.msg("Unregistration successful, and reactor won't crash")
            reactor.callLater(0, self._def.callback, True)
        def handle_error(e):
            log.msg("Unregistration failed...")
            reactor.callLater(0, self._def.callback, False)

        log.msg("Calling XmlRPC backend (and crashing)")
        p = Proxy('http://natulte.net/pub/fgs/RPC2.php')
        d = p.callRemote('fgsd.register',
                         "00000000000000000000000000000000",
                         "bleh")
        self._def = defer.Deferred()
        d.addCallbacks(handle_success, handle_error)
        return self._def
****************************************************************
****************************************************************

Nevertheless, this feels more like a workaround than a complete
solution.  What do you all think?

- Dave.

You'll notice I've reassigned some tickets to you and will continue to

So... what will new protocol be called? pb2/newpb is confusing, I think.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] ProducerConsumerProxy problem
Message-ID: <7a1008db0604300717m76b7217cg65ecef2aa6d5ce53@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to setup a ProducerConsumerProxy between a
protocols.basic.FileSender producer and a TCP Protocol transport.
I have the following code:

fileObj = file('test.txt','r')
proxy = protocols.pcp.ProducerConsumerProxy(self.transport)
producer = protocols.basic.FileSender()
dd = producer.beginFileTransfer(fileObj, proxy)
dd.addCallback(self.uploadDone)
dd.addErrback(self.uploadError)
proxy.registerProducer(producer, False)

The problem is that only 16KB of data are transfered and then the
transfer pauses. Also if I use BasicProducerConsumerProxy no data at
all gets transfered. I think that the proxy doesn't call resumeProducing()
on
the FileSender producer and thats why the transfer seems to halt.

Any suggestions ?

I found the solution.

The problem was that by default our proxys producer is registered with
streaming = True
which is not what we want.
The following line will register our proxys producer with streaming = False
ProducerConsumerProxy.iAmStreaming = False
The rest is the same.
I think adding an argument to ProducerConsumerProxy.__init__ about streaming
would
be a good idea.
proxy = ProducerConsumerProxy(self.client.transport)
dd = FileSender().beginFileTransfer(self.outgoingFile, proxy)
dd.addCallback(self.uploadDone)
dd.addErrback(self.uploadError)

twisted/doc/pb/using-pb.xhtml introduces the new concepts, there're some
examples, and iirc there's been an 0.01 release recently.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Status of components, protocols, etc in Twisted
Message-ID: <17493.24492.57227.748654@terry.jones.tc>

I'm trying to better understand componentized architectures, protocols,
adaptors etc., as done in Python. I've been reading around and have a few
questions about the state of play. It would be good to understand where
things are, and where they're heading.

It seems there are (or were) 3 efforts to provide components, protocols,
adaptors, etc.: Zope, Twisted, PyProtocols.

It looks like Twisted is now using the zope module to do this. But I also
ran across discussion (on this list, in Feb 2004, I think), about possibly
migrating zope's use of components to PyProtocols. Did that happen?

I do like the sound of PyProtocols (and PEAK in general), but as someone
else said, and as Philip wrote, the documentation isn't really focused on
easing in a newbie.  A couple of points on those docs, I think it would be
good if someone set out how you would go about building something small
(i.e., small concrete examples, not "big" more abstract ones). Yes, that
someone could be me, agreed. Also, the docs say that it is intended that
_all_ uses of type(), isinstance() etc., can/should be replaced. A few use
cases would be helpful - how are we supposed to replace those things? I do
have the impression that one should have a clean componentized design from
the beginning and thereby never need or want to resort to introspection. If
that's the case, it might be worth saying, as the docs leave one wondering
if there's not perhaps some formulaic way to rewrite one's code to do the
Right Thing.  It's not that simple though, right?

I'd also be happy to use the standard Twisted (i.e., zope) approach too.

Do people have an opinion about which is better to use? Does it make much
difference if you're just building a simple app with a handful of
components you'd like to be able to swap in & out easily?

I think the Twisted evolution of finger pages are really good, with a
couple of minor weak points (e.g., highlighting new code from example to
example). It's amazing what you can get done in a couple of hundred lines
of Twisted code. BTW, there's a mention of __implements__ whereas
implements() is used, which I guess is a hang over from an earlier version?
This is on
http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/tutorial/components.html
I guess someone will look for others. Grepping __implements__ gets a lot of
hits in the distributed Twisted-2.2.0 docs (e.g., in doc/howto/*.html).

Anyway, thanks for all the docs and code. I'm happy to put some work into
making improvements where I can.

Terry

Today, Twisted simply provides a single global registry on top of Zope Interface's normal layer.  Twisted's original interface implementation was derivative of Zope's and introduced some horrible bugs and some interesting ideas; the interesting ideas were incorporated into Zope, and the horrible bugs left behind.

No.  Some people liked PyProtocols better, but we had the discussion, we made the decision, and Zope Interface has worked out very well.

The release isn't out yet; I'm currently working on another (small) round of
improvements to the release infrastructure and hopefully a lot of stuff will
be released soon.
