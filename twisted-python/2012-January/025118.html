There is no authoritative statement about what twisted.words is not because twisted.words is incomplete.  You can definitely use it for servers, and many people do.

All of the facilities for parsing the client side of an XMPP connection also work for the server side.  And twisted.words does currently have some facilities for dealing with servers, such as 'twistd xmpp-router'.

You may be interested in several extensions to twisted.words.  Wokkel, especially, is hopefully going to be included in twisted.words itself at some point: &lt;<A HREF="http://wokkel.ik.nu/">http://wokkel.ik.nu/</A>&gt;.  Idavoll provides publish/subscribe functionality on top of wokkel and twisted.words: &lt;<A HREF="http://idavoll.ik.nu/">http://idavoll.ik.nu/</A>&gt;.  Palaver provides a multi-user chat component: &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/twonds/palaver">https://github.com/twonds/palaver</A>&gt; - however, most of the links to the original sites for Palaver appear to be dead now, so I gather that project has stopped development.

Ultimately, what you have to keep in mind is that twisted.words, like all of Twisted, is an open source project and not a commercial product.  If you would like it to do more than it does, please contribute code to help it grow into a full-featured XMPP solution.
