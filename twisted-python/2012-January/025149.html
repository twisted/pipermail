Does anyone have any opinion on what other method name would make sense and still be close to maintaining consistency with the rest of the outgoing method names?

Hi Matthew,

&quot;Heartbeat&quot; functionality was implemented in IRCClient and released in
Twisted 11.1.0, see ticket #5047
&lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5047">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5047</A>&gt;, by default it sends a
PING every 120 seconds.

You don't actually need to acknowledge the PONG for the purpose of
keeping the client alive and active, writing any data to the transport
is enough to trigger connectionLost if the connection is genuinely
dead.

Hope this helps.
