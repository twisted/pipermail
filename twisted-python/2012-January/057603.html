<PRE>I am pleased to announce the release version 0.70 of MV3D! This release includes a massive amount of new features and over 70 bugfixes. The main focus was on usability and involved a large amount of work on tools. In 0.70, Panda3D support was brought up to par with animation, terrain texture splatting, and skydomes. One of the things we are most excited about is the Windows development environment installer. This is an easy installer that will quickly set up any Windows system to develop MV3D. If you've been watching the project and want to get involved, there's no better time!

MV3D is an open source multiplayer game and virtual world framework written in Python which uses Twisted for networking. It encompasses a scalable server with dynamic load balancing, a robust set of content creation tools, and an extensible 3D client application. MV3D provides the foundation to build anything from 3D chat rooms to full MMORPGs with the goal of letting you concentrate on creating a unique virtual world instead of the infrastructure to support it.

For more information on MV3D and this or future releases, please visit the website at <A HREF="http://www.mv3d.com">http://www.mv3d.com</A> . The full release notes for version 0.70 are available online at this URL: <A HREF="http://www.mv3d.com/trac/browser/tags/mv3d-0.70/release-notes.txt">http://www.mv3d.com/trac/browser/tags/mv3d-0.70/release-notes.txt</A> . For further inquiries, feel free to stop by our IRC channel on irc.freenode.net #MV3D.

Release 0.75 will be focused on bugfixing and adding full support for Linux + Ogre and OS X + Panda. We are currently looking for help porting and testing on these platforms. Let me know if you are interested!

Enjoy,

Mike
