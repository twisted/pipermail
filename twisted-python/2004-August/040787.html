<PRE>It is interesting to step back and see how complicated this whole book 
epic has become..

Maybe the answer is not a foundation or a group hug via paypal, maybe 
the answer is just one guy who can read and write to just write a book.

I still think the current Twisted book is very good with one criticism. 
Chapter 2 has the title &quot;Tutorial&quot;, so new people think they can just 
read that chapter and understand Twisted. The title should be &quot;An 
Introduction Example&quot; instead of &quot;Tutorial&quot;, and maybe it should be an 
appendix which is where I personally think it belongs.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Tim,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for some well thought ideas and comments. I'm vocal and I'm 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interested. And my gloves on the keyboard are busy such that my brain 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can grok as much of Twisted as possible. If only I could just plug 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into the Matrix and grok it all in one fell swoop! :-)  I'm learning 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> atop lately, and then its on to nevow.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe there's a nevow expert in the crowd (Mary Gardiner, aren't you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a Nevow maestro?) who is willing to collaborate such that we can get 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Twisted Foundation into motion along the lines of what Tim has 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggested? Tim, would you be up for helping out in some form or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another? Hey, I bet we could get some ideas and suggestions from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mitch Kapor's group since they are going to be using Twisted and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would probably like to see its Declaration of Independence. Or maybe 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone from Mozilla or Apache can give us some ideas of what to do 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and what not to do since they've been through the trials and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tribulations of Foundation genesis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Oh yes, and another thought -- what about the company Zoteca in New 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> York City? Surely they would be interested in a Twisted Foundation, no?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mate, are you any of these people? are you Mary? or Tim? or a member 
</I>&gt;<i> of the Apache or Mozilla Foundations? are you Perhaps Mitch Kapor, or 
</I>&gt;<i> Zoteca, whoever they are?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can't publically suggest our involvement in your dream, its just 
</I>&gt;<i> not very polite, to say the least. Or do you think to excite us into 
</I>&gt;<i> action?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My last email was possibly taken out of context, I was suggesting that 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't oppose you going off and doing these things, some of which I 
</I>&gt;<i> didn't think where bad ideas, but you cant expect any help for free, 
</I>&gt;<i> Noone else is interested, or seems to see a need.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of the great things about having a Foundation is that it doesn't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to keep secrets. It is truly open and there are no hidden cards 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the deck. At the same time, anyone is free to birth artificial 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> persons in any territory on Earth who then can utilize the Foundation 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but also contribute back to it. This is why Twisted needs a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Declaration of Independence IMHO. I see no reason why *not* to create 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a Twisted Foundation for the benefit of humankind.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Imagine, a kid in Africa who has access to the 'Net who is learning 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> computer science could participate in the Twisted Foundation and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contribute something really cool, such as a new protocol, to the code 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> base. Or some child in Thailand could use Twisted's Perspective 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Broker and Nevow to create some really neat 'net-based agriculture 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Web service for the farmers and hill tribe people in northeast 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agricultural Thailand (where Internet cafes continue to sprout up). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And of course really cool apps and services could be created by the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whiz gurus in the more modernized countries at the same time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A Foundation is a self serving entity whose goal is to survive 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> independent of any others who make use of it. A Foundation owes 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing to no one, and can not be held hostage by anyone. Foundations 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are good for humanity. Foundations have need not retain secrets. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Foundations do not impose detriment on others. I can't imagine a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world without Apache (yikes, we'd all be forced to using Microsoft's 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IIS Web Server).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I seriously think you have missed the point. Nothing procludes anyones 
</I>&gt;<i> involvment in twisted, its LGPL, and the core developers, let alone 
</I>&gt;<i> the ancilliary ones are from all walks of life/regions of the globe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any further comments, ideas, brainstorms, suggestions?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Idea:
</I>&gt;<i> Chill out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Brainstorm:
</I>&gt;<i> I think you're insulting people with your lack of understanding, and 
</I>&gt;<i> blind ranting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Suggestion:
</I>&gt;<i> Get to know the community and the project before making wild 
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions. People will take your suggestions more seriously when 
</I>&gt;<i> your credible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
