Mary, this an excellent question. I don't know the answer. I looked at 
Glyph's blog post again and he said that Alex Martelli was the person who 
nudged him about a book at OSCON a few days ago. Glyph says that Alex is an 
author of other O'Reilly books, so Alex knows the answers to these questions 
about funding the First Edition Twisted O'Reilly book (with Ghost Knife Fish 
as the animal on the front cover :) I found Alex's email address in the 
Twisted Matrix and cc'ed him because I think its a good time to rally around 
the genesis of the book. Really, the time has come.

The people at OSAF have made a decision to use Twisted for Chandler. I think 
this is HUGE. The father of Lotus Notes and his team doesn't make decisions 
haphazardly. I'll bet even they would love to see a book come out on Twisted 
by O'Reilly. Any comments Brian?

Thanks Britt and Liming for your comments today and sharing your experiences 
as a beginner. I just got started myself about a month ago. I'd also love to 
see animated diagrams using SVG and SMIL to show the *flow* of async aspects 
and abstracts associated with Twisted applications.

Glyph, you asked us to write you &lt; 
<A HREF="http://www.livejournal.com/users/glyf/22637.html">http://www.livejournal.com/users/glyf/22637.html</A> &gt; , so I am doing as you 
requested!

Calling on Glyph, calling on Itamar, calling on Radix, calling on JP, et 
al!!!!
