Well, the problem is that currently the select reactor assumes that if
select says a socket is writeable, then it is writeable, i.e it is safe to
attempt to write any amount of data to it (with the understanding that being
non-blocking it might only be able to accept some of that data immediately).
Apparently this assumption is not quite accurate.

So far in this thread I've seen two theories about what the exact problem
is, and I think the correct fix depends on which is actually the cause.

Theory 1: Writing large (i.e. 5MB) chunks to sockets in a single send call
will always fail, and should.  The fix for this would be to make sure that
no more than 64kB (or whatever) is passed to send at a time, regardless of
what is passed to transport.write.

Theory 2: Writing lots and lots of data very fast can cause the network
hardware's/device driver's internal buffers to fill up, thus making it
impossible to write even though select claims it is.  If this is the case,
the socket needs to be ignored for a moment to give those buffers a chance
to flush.

A test case proving which is actually the case would be most welcome :)

-Andrew.
