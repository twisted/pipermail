Or alternatively, what are the barriers to contributing to Twisted that
you think a foundation would help people overcome? If you have a list of
problems, then suggested solutions can be evaluated properly.

A few things have come up:

 1. many Twisted developers are employed full-time, not all on Twisted or
    Twisted-related projects (and some of them are happy with this of
    course) or have lots of projects and not enough hours

 2. developers of large monolithic projects like a &quot;Twisted book&quot; may
    need/want money to develop the project

 ...

Now as far as I can see, there's not a lot a foundation could do about
(1) or (2) until it had quite a lot of funding (and recall that
&quot;someone&quot;[1] must get it to that stage). It may be that there are other
more informal solutions to these and other issues.

[1] The existance of &quot;someone&quot; is a common myth in volunteer projects.
