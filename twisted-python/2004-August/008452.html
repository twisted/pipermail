   How many clients are we talking about?  A bit of investigation leads 
me to believe this can be caused by reaching the maximum number of open 
sockets.  Having unreliable connections can exacerbate this, since 
TIME_WAIT sockets are counted towards the limit (Windows NT 4.0 seems to 
leave sockets in this state for 4 minutes).

   Twisted should still probably handle it, but if this is the true 
cause, it should be handled in a fashion similar to errors from 
accept(), possibly (a better understanding of the problem is probably 
still required).
