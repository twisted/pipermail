The main difficulty that I'm aware of is that many of the principal 
Twisted contributors, myself included, are too busy to even spend much 
time on Twisted itself at the moment, let alone hacking on it, their 
other projects, and writing a book at the same time.

Thank you everyone, for all the enthusiasm, but I'm pretty sure there 
are a few projects in the works, at least one of which should result in 
a Twisted book.  I'd prefer to keep the discussion off-list in the 
future since I really don't know that I can say anything else about 
these projects except that at least some of them exist, somewhere.  
Feel free to drop me a line if you have the time and energy to 
contribute to a book, though.

Personally I'd like to see a Grue on the cover (as that is our official 
mascot) but the ghost knife fish sounds like an interesting animal if 
we have to stick to a real one.

By the way - please do not Cc: me on messages to this list - it's safe 
to assume I subscribe to it and read all the messages :).
