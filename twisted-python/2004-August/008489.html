Welllll, since you ask.. :)

Here's a relatively self-contained project that could use working on:

twisted.web.microdom and twisted.web.sux is supposed to implement an 
XML/XHTML and HTML parser. It is pretty useless as an XML parser, given 
its relative slowness and the existence of expat/python xml libraries 
which do already do a very good job of being an XML parser. Microdom is 
*almost* a useful HTML parser, but it's missing support for a lot of 
HTML peculiarities that really need to be handled 
(&quot;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;foo&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;bar&quot; for one, strange whitespace collapsing rules, 
for another, and I'm sure there's more). Perl has a very good HTML 
parser in HTML::TreeParser whose algorithms could be duplicated.

This project isn't even very twisted specific (sux/microdom only have 
very minor dependancies on the rest of twisted) so it could conceivably 
be made into a general purpose python module in its own right. There 
are a variety of other Python HTML parsers, but from what I can tell, 
they're even worse than microdom is. It'd be way cool to have a python 
HTML parser that actually works. Can't let perl win! Any 
victi...volunteers? ;0
