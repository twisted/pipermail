<PRE>&gt;<i> This wasn't spectacularly obvious to me the first time either, but I
</I>&gt;<i> think it's covered somewhere in the deferred execution howto; in your
</I>&gt;<i> callback/errback, return a new deferred and the processing of the
</I>&gt;<i> deferred chain will pause until that new deferred fires. Â Here's an
</I>&gt;<i> example of code that does that...

Thanks for your reply, Mike! I don't thoroughly understand your code yet, but 
I'm workin' on it. One of the things I don't like about the examples is that 
they don't demonstrate a conditional addition of a callback.

One of the things I did try was returning a new Deferred from step2(), but it 
didn't work, and I'm not sure why. I'm checking out defer.py now to try to 
figure out how it works...
