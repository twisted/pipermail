<PRE>Hi Griatch,

 

Our stack-based solution for customers hosting our platform requires the same.  We could compile and distribute, but then we’d have to support dependencies… and I’ve never been a fan of embedded dependencies.  We do that for software installation (embedding python and libs into a binary via PyInstaller), but for production run-time it’s just the modules – hence similar dependencies on developer tools being installed.

 

The Microsoft link has changed over the years.  I’ve pasted what we have in our documentation for those tools below, which looks like it’s validated on Windows 10 Pro, Win server 2012 R2, and Win server 2016.  Also, on the Server side, I believe you also need to be mindful of the .NET versioning… in case there’s another application dependency.

 

=======================

Get the developer tools from Microsoft:

 

1.	Go to the following URL:  <A HREF="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/">https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/</A>
2.	Download and run the vs_community file 
3.	Select &quot;Desktop development with C++&quot; 
4.	Reboot when finished 

 

-Chris

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Binary wheels for Twisted on Windows?

 

Hi, 

 

I'm investigating installing the Evennia MU* server on Windows. We use Twisted and will be requiring Python3.7 in our next release. I need to make easy-to-use install instructions since a lot of Windows users use our library. 

 

I tested with a Windows7 64bit VM and installed everything from scratch to emulate what a non-dev Windows user would see. I don't have Windows10 so can't compare to the install experience there (but Windows7 64bit is still relevant, having something like 24% of the active Windows user-base according to Steam).

 

Using pip to install Evennia, at the Twisted requirement install step I run into an error telling me that I need &quot;Microsoft Visual C++ build tools&quot; from the URL <A HREF="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads.">https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads.</A> The first issue is that there does not appear to be any build-tools package named like that on that page or sub-page (at least not what I could find after digging around). I tried to install a few similarly-named packages, like &quot;Visual Studio Build Tools&quot;, but  had no luck getting past the Twisted install point. So that recommendation-string should likely be updated. 

 

The thing is though, while I could probably personally figure out how to set it up eventually, our Windows users are likely the least tech-savvy of our users. Requiring them to set up a compiler environment (despite us telling them that Python code does not need compilation) a bit too much. 

It seems Twisted has distributed binary Windows wheels in the past, would it be possible to get them again? Or should I recommend some other, specific install procedure for our Windows users?

 

Cheers, 

Griatch, Evennia dev
