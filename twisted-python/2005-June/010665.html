I'm reasonably sure it doesn't. You can't have threads in a single
process owned by different users. What you would have to do is
run different processes.

The only way I can think of right now, after only one coffee, 
is to have one twisted process that sits on the port
and waits for connections. When it gets one, it authenticates the
user then sends a message (pb maybe) to a superuser-owned process
whose only job is to fork(2) a user-owned process for file io
and to inform it how to talk with the original process that is 
holding the port... It would remain to write the file io &lt;--&gt; pb
glue I think...

Cheers,
