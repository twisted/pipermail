You can't have (in TCP) something that is both server and client on same
port. You can either connect while bound to a port or you can listen to
a port. It is possible with UDP, however.

However: there is no reason why TCP clients should connect *from* a
specific port, it doesn't give you anything. So why bother? Just have
servers listen on a well known port.
