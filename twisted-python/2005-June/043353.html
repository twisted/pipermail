Our codebase at work still uses old cred.  I've never had the time or 
customer requirement to do the upgrade.  Unless I'd get a performance 
benefit out of it, it'd be hard to justify the time spent.

On the other hand, perhaps I do not need Twisted 2.1 either.  What do I 
stand to gain by making the switch?  What benefit can I use to sell 
this?  I assume that I could do this fairly incrementally as we have 
about 10 different processes that communicate within a server cluster 
over PB.  I still use the old PB APIs too (so no PBClientFactory for me!).

We still use the old application code as well for the same sorts of 
reasons. :)  I don't think we have anything that relies on that though, 
we just use barebones tap files (more deprecated code!).
