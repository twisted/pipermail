<PRE>Hi Justin,

Thank you for you quick reply :)

&gt;<i> What is the problem you are trying to solve here?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I mean, in theory, yes, you could do what you're proposing. Why do you
</I>&gt;<i> want to, though?
</I>
I'm trying to write a TURN server:

<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-midcom-turn-07.txt">http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-rosenberg-midcom-turn-07.txt</A>

The TURN client which is behind a NAT will ask the TURN server (with
public address) to allocate a public transport address for it to
receive data from outside.

There're two requests while the client trying to allocate a public
transport address from the TURN server:
 * Share Secret Request: over TLS; to obtain a one-time username and
passwd and keep the passwd as the share secret of both side (the
server and the client)
 * Allocate Request: to allocate a public transport address from the server

As the draft said:

&quot;A TURN server MUST be prepared to receive  Binding (should be
Allocate - eric) Requests over TCP and UDP.&quot; (P10)

&quot;The Allocate Request MUST be sent to the same IP address and port as the Shared
Secret Request. This is because one time passwords are expected to be
host-specific.&quot; (P20)

That means both the Share Secret Request (over TLS) and Allocate
Request will be sent to the same IP and port of the server.

Then, the draft said:

&quot;The client SHOULD close its connection when it has completed
allocating username and passwords.&quot; (P19)

So, while the client sends the Allocate Request to the server over
TCP, the process would look like this (assuming the server is
listening on port 12345 for TLS connection):

* the client sends the Share Secret Request to server:12345 _over TLS_
and obtains a one-time username and passwd
* the client closes the TLS connection
* the client sends the Allocate Request to server:12345 _again_ to
allocate a public transport address...

It seems that I have to implement what I've mentioned in my previous mail?
I'm not a native English speaker, and TURN is only a draft, maybe I've
misunderstood something?
