I've go tthe same difficulties here.  I'm trying to integrate into Twisted a 
method (which comes from a python+C compiled module) that returns data. The 
problem is that this method is blocking, so I can't integrate it easily in 
Twisted.
So what I would like to do is, in a perfect world (i think):
- Make an infinite loop in which I have this blocking method
- When some data is returned from that method call, do some stuff on it, like
call a PB remote method, call a deferred, adding callbacks (I mean I need/use
the reactor). This work would not be blocking (it shouldn't as it's twisted 
stuff) as I need to get the results (callbacks).
- loop, etc.

My current solution is to use a separate thread for that blocking call, 
keeping the main twisted reactor in the main process. I can call twisted 
deferred by using the callFromThread() method, but the code is horribly big 
(and slow) and complex, even using exarkun's ThreadWrapper (from sandbox) :-(
Is threadedselectreactor what I'm looking for? I did not really understand 
what reactor.interleave() is supposed to call, as all I have is a method to 
call which blocks...
