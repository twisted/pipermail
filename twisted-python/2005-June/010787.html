Two things about that:
1) resumeProducing actually now says:
     def resumeProducing(self):
         self.paused = False
         self.transport.resumeProducing()
         self.dataReceived('')

This was changed because of &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/">http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/</A> 
twisted-python/2005-February/009626.html&gt; also &lt;http:// 
twistedmatrix.com/bugs/issue899&gt;.

However, if resumeProducing is allowed to immediately produce data,  
this is somewhat bogus, as it could reverse the order of the data. In  
reality, a TCP transport's resumeProducing will not immediately  
produce data, but I think that's a fragile API to both have  
resumeProducing immediately produce data, and depend on a call to  
someone else resumeProducing not immediately producing data. I think  
there's an issue here.

2) dataReceived can be easily fixed to handle this by using a local  
-- patch coming separately.
