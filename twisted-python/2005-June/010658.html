Saying it's the greatest thing since wxsupport.py is considerably less 
of a ringing endorsement :).  It should also have more tests, but then, 
what in Twisted shouldn't?  I'm just saying it needs docs.

There is no reason to abandon existing _working_ reactors - for example, 
I have a soft spot for gtk2reactor.  Still, I think it makes sense to 
abandon the ones we know are broken and have no serious plan to fix, 
like wx (and maybe qt, from looking at the buildbot?).  Also it makes 
sense to have some least-common-denominator for working with really 
weird event loops, like the event loop one might find on a handheld 
device, such as fltk or the neutrino gui...  (I have never actually 
worked with either of those, they're just examples)
