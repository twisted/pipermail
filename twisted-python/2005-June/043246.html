Thank you for the email. You can also send mail to the address that I
use to post to this list though...

Since this might be applicable more widely: as for what use you would be
at a sprint, well, there will be a few things going on:

 - writing and editing of existing Twisted documentation. You could be
   of use as a writer, editor, proofreader or reviewer
 - coding on a couple of projects including the VFS layer. You could be
   of use as a coder, code reviewer or tester

They don't really work on a &quot;farming tasks out&quot; basis though, ie there
is no Sprint Master watching everyone to make sure they have something
to do and aren't lost or bored. You just sit around and code (write,
review, test...) with a bunch of other people. They're generally small
enough that you'll get to know everyone well. People can pair with you
to let you in on their projects.

(All further mails regarding the sprint can be sent directly to me using
the address above. Watch it when you hit reply, they go back to the list
by default.)

-Mary
