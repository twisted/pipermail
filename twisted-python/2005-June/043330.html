</I>In my case, for instance, 86400 repeated 1 second TimerService calls 
might take a few minutes more than precisely 24 hours (which is 
acceptable, so I haven't checked further). I am guessing that something 
outside of Twisted, running at a higher process priority  occasionally 
ties up the machine long enough to miss at least one scheduled cycle, 
possibly even more than one. AFAICT LoopingCall doesn't make any attempt 
to compensate for entirely missed (i.e., catastrophically missed) 
cycles, only for the minor slippage that might otherwise lead to 
gradually missed ones. Right?

Not a Twisted issue; hence recommending bumping process priority.
