<PRE>I'm getting stuck trying to do something I imagined would be easy in 
Conch.  I want to log into a server, ls a directory, then grep inside a 
certain file in each of the directories found by the ls command.

I've had no trouble logging in and running ls, then capturing its 
output.  But then I'm stuck.  I can't figure out where to put the loop 
through the directories.  I can see how to do one in a new channel, but 
I sure can't see how to run the series of them and capture their 
output.  I want to end up with a data structure that has the directory 
name and the results of the grep as a list: [(dir, grep_results),...].

I've tried calling my &quot;grep&quot; channel object repeatedly and that sort of 
works, but only does the first seven or eight and fails.  I've tried 
putting the loop in the channelOpen method of the &quot;grep&quot; channel and 
that never gets any results.  I tried building a series of callbacks in 
there and running it, but that doesn't work, either.

What I also find confusing is that I run the command with sendRequest, 
but the results come back in the dataReceived method -- how does it know 
which command's results it is receiving?

Any help will be appreciated.

Nick
