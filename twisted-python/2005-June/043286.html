It sounds like you want something like DeferredList.

&gt;<i> I've tried calling my &quot;grep&quot; channel object repeatedly and that sort of

</I>&gt;<i> putting the loop in the channelOpen method of the &quot;grep&quot; channel and

</I>
What fails?  Does the channel fail to open?  Does it return the wrong
results?

&gt;<i> What I also find confusing is that I run the command with sendRequest, 
</I>&gt;<i> but the results come back in the dataReceived method -- how does it know 
</I>&gt;<i> which command's results it is receiving?
</I>
sendRequest tells the server what command to run.  The server runs that
command, and connects stdout/stdin to the SSH connection.  dataReceived
is then called with the data from stdout.

If you can get the code even into one file, that would be helpful.  It's
hard to know quite what's going on without seeing what you're doing.
