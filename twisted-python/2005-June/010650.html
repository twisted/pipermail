Hi, 
First of all I'm using akadav1 which is library/application built on 
top of Twisted thus I post my question here.
I'm trying to make &quot;akadav1&quot; work &quot;the way I like&quot; and I face problem: 
I want akadav1 server to write out Files with permissions of 
currently connected user. Meaning that I'd like to run server as some 
regular user (say 'akadav') and when it operates on files do 
setuid(&lt;currentl_user&gt;) before any operation so it behaves same way 
as normal operation on FS would for that user. I came down to 
Resource class and see it possibly could be done extending this 
class. 
My problem right now is that I can't run server as unprivileged user 
and switch to other user's accounts. That would mean that I'd 
probably need:
1. run server as privileged user so I can setuid(...) any time I want
or
2. run two threads or so so that one thread is superuser-owned and the 
other one (the one that responds to requests) is non-privileged. 
First one will handle file operations since it can change uid 
on-the-flight and come back to normal.

I would prefer to implement second solution but I'm puzzled on where 
to start. Does twisted provide such capabilities out-of-the-box?

I'm not subscribed to the list, so please CC me on reply.
