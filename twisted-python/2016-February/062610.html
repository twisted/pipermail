<PRE>Will one of the ML admins please ban the address sending these emails? It
is a little annoying. Not sure if anyone else is getting them.

&gt;<i> To Whom it May Concern:
</I>&gt;<i> It has truly been an honor to be your insurance agent over the many years
</I>&gt;<i> that we have been in business! Today it saddens my heart to inform you that
</I>&gt;<i> The Palmer Agency will no longer be able to handle your insurance needs at
</I>&gt;<i> this time. Some of you are aware and some are not on the difficult battle
</I>&gt;<i> that took place beginning in 2013 - trying to save the life of my infant
</I>&gt;<i> son (while I was pregnant). I do not regret any decisions that I made to
</I>&gt;<i> try everything I humanly could to save my son - even though it was
</I>&gt;<i> unsuccessful &amp; now he rests in the arms of Jesus. Today I still have
</I>&gt;<i> multiple complications from the decisions that I made to fight for my son
</I>&gt;<i> and I have multiple, complicated hospital stays that I must focus on. If
</I>&gt;<i> you would have asked me years ago if I would no longer be a Farmers Agent
</I>&gt;<i> so soon I would have never believed you - but also if you would have asked
</I>&gt;<i> me if I would have had my home burn down to the ground, or my son die in my
</I>&gt;<i> arms exhausting all options that I could do I would never believe that
</I>&gt;<i> either! Unfortunately we are not promised an easy life or a fair life. That
</I>&gt;<i> is why we have to life each day as if it is our last day and put God first
</I>&gt;<i> every day. Everyday I choose to pick up my cross daily. Right now in my
</I>&gt;<i> career - I can no longer be your agent. I am so sorry for this. I am
</I>&gt;<i> honored that you have chosen me for this because I do know that you have
</I>&gt;<i> the option to chose. I hope that you can understand that right now I need
</I>&gt;<i> to focus on being the best Mommy/Wife to an amazing husband, and two
</I>&gt;<i> beautiful girls that I still have here for as long as possible!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know reading this could be filled with anger and frustration but I pray
</I>&gt;<i> that you find understanding in your heart for my situation. You are not
</I>&gt;<i> going to be left out in the cold. There are great notes on every single
</I>&gt;<i> account. You are still with the most amazing company Farmers Insurance. At
</I>&gt;<i> the end of this email you will have all the contact information needed to
</I>&gt;<i> be able to get in touch with anyone on your account. It has been great
</I>&gt;<i> getting to know each and every one of you and your families. I pray nothing
</I>&gt;<i> but the best for all of your families! I would like to assure each and
</I>&gt;<i> everyone of you that I made sure that I didn't leave until everything was
</I>&gt;<i> in place to make sure every client would be completely taken care of - you
</I>&gt;<i> can verify that if needed. I got with the district office &amp; I put off
</I>&gt;<i> multiple needed medical stays to assure that not even one client wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> have a way to reach an agent to help them! I wouldn't want to be treated
</I>&gt;<i> that way &amp; I wouldn't want to treat any of my clients that way!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most importantly in this Goodbye I would want you to take a moment and
</I>&gt;<i> look at your life. Is it over whelming? I can remember when I thought that
</I>&gt;<i> things were so hectic and stressful....then my house burned down. Then I
</I>&gt;<i> thought....it doesn't get any worse then that. Then I got pregnant while I
</I>&gt;<i> was in transition from my house burning down. Then I found out my son had a
</I>&gt;<i> multi-cystic kidney &amp; no Dr's wanted to help me! Then I had to go around
</I>&gt;<i> the country begging for help convincing Dr's that my son's life mattered!
</I>&gt;<i> Then I endured painful treatments multiple times a week to save my
</I>&gt;<i> son......then I got an infection and my son passed away before Christmas &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> I remember thinking can't I go back to when I thought life was hectic and
</I>&gt;<i> stressful? If you have healthy &amp; happy children you will never know how
</I>&gt;<i> blessed you truly are! I thank God for every moment I have had with my
</I>&gt;<i> children. God never promised life would be easy. I urge anyone reading this
</I>&gt;<i> to get into God's word and his promises and he can and will turn whatever
</I>&gt;<i> situation your in around if you allow him!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank You All &amp; God Bless,
