Currently, GitHub Issues don't allow for non-committers to make modifications to categories, milestones, edit the original ticket description, or close tickets. This kinda sucks, because it makes the pool of triagers smaller, and also makes most obvious review queue methods harder (adding a category).

I think Mark Williams or someone has hacked up a bot to sidestep this, but... again, contributor effort to get that past the line.

Are there enough non-committers to Twisted who are actively doing this
right now, to make this
as big an issue as you are claiming?  My guess is no.
Other projects related to klein and treq are using GitHub to track issues
instead of Trac.
Do those projects have problem with non-committers triaging issues, despite
the inability to
create/modify categories/milestones, etc.?

I'm a little confused.  What do you mean by "process / workflow / markers" if not "the things required to accept a PR or do a review"?

Mark Williams already started working on this: https://github.com/markrwilliams/txghbot

We should have more verbiage around the comment stuff, including the "always say thank you twice" rule which I don't think is written down anywhere :-).

>> Reviewing: This is the potentially slightly odd part.  I believe a review that doesn't result in acceptance should close the PR.  We need to be careful to always include some text that explains that closing a PR does not mean that the change is rejected, just that the submitter must re-submit.  Initially this would just mean opening a new PR, but Mark Williams is working on a bot to re-open pull requests when a submitter posts a "please review" comment: https://github.com/markrwilliams/txghbot

Yep!

I still want to require people to open an issue first so we can separate closing PRs ("this patch is too bad to be accepted, please try again") from closing tickets or issues ("we do not want to do this work").

I can update https://twisted.reviews/ <https://twisted.reviews/> (at some point) when to point at the appropriate link.  (You've all got it bookmarked, right?)

"Poorly" :-).

A failure mode of many open source projects is that they have terrible latency when responding to new contributors.

Cryptography is kind of a weird project with a somewhat rarified contributor audience, I don't know if it makes sense to copy their process.

"Submit for review" is such an action, so, yes.

Yes.  It's a huge issue.  If I didn't have a regular task to manually comb those trackers I don't know if anything would get looked at; I have nothing to point others at other than "just randomly peruse the list of open issues".  Trac is hot garbage but I miss it every time I have to look at my not-quite-working ad-hoc query to figure out what the workflow state on everything there is.

That said: if we could get this ALL into github, then we could write ONE query that would be the full review queue for all Twisted org projects.  And that would be amazing, a huge upgrade from what we've got now.

Finishing txghbot is probably not a ton of work, but it's not zero either.

To be clear, because I am grumpy about a lot of specifics with respect to GH issues: I agree with this and I hope it can happen.

The major missing feature, as discussed in the PR thread, is the ability to record the separate workflow state of "needs review" / "needs feedback addressed" as distinct from "open" / "closed".  A bot that could do this would address more or less the entire issue.

One issue which I haven't seen raised here is the need to maintain a redirection service, to ensure that the massive amount of information currently recorded in commit messages and emails linking to existing trac issues is not lost.

While, in general, I strongly agree with this, and I would personally very much like to operate less infrastructure, there is the fact that the twistedmatrix.com <http://twistedmatrix.com/> website has served as a very important dogfooding resource for us in the past.  We've found and fixed dozens of bugs in Twisted due to our constant, intense use of it.

That said, this is not really an argument against doing this.  Maybe if we didn't have to operate something as old and clunky as Trac we could invest our dogfooding effort in new, cool web toys where the effort was writing and debugging code using Twisted and not shell scripts to restart zombie processes.  I just think it's important to consider how the developer community can continue to use Twisted itself as part of this process.

Rather than write a bot specific to Twisted, why not just adapt the Twisted
project to use a bot written by another project?

For example, the Zulip project has written zulipbot:

https://github.com/zulip/zulipbot#zulipbot

Docs for it are here:

http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zulipbot-usage.html

and a presentation for it was given here:

http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1992

A lot of the motivations for zulipbot are similar to what the Twisted
project is facing:
https://github.com/zulip/zulipbot/wiki/FAQ

such as giving non-committers the ability to add labels to issues or PR's.

zulipbot is actively used, and you can see it in action in their issues and
PR's:
https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20or%20is%3Apull

I've met some of the Zulip developers at Pybay.  They are really focused on
improving developer experience and
onboarding of new developers.  Rather than maintain our own bot, the
Twisted project would probably
get further along with zulipbot, and working with the zulip developers to
fill in any missing gaps on that bot.

Personally I don't care either way :-).  I was just describing my understanding of the existing plan, not endorsing it.  Hopefully someone more directly involved will comment.

I expect that in order to make this happen, we will need a transition
period in which the current system should continue to work, that is
automatically set/remove "review" keyword to Trac.
In this way, the new way(tm) can be implemented in various ways (and
experiment with different ways) and nobody should complain as the old
system will just work.

For my project, I am using Klein as the hooks server, but it is based
on Trac XML-RPC, so I don't think it can be used for Twisted.

---------------

With that in mind, I think that txghbot or something based on
python/twisted is easier.
We would need to talk with Trac... maybe over PB

I remember there was a PB based channel for communicating with Trac
but I can't find where it is defined.
I see that kenan is using something [1] BOT_PORT = 15243, I can't find
where a service with that port is started.

Regards,
Adi

Hi,

1. Are Travis OSX builds functional yet? Can we switch to Travis for

Over https://www.traviscistatus.com/ I see no backlog for macOS.

that the only way to trigger the required tests is to create a new
branch in twisted/twisted.

Then you can go to
https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/boxes-supported?branch=9176-inlinetracebacks-tardyp
and force the tests.

This looks complicated, so what I was doing, is create a new PR.

--------

Am I doing something wrong?
Is there a simple way?
Am I the only one who thinks this is not productive?

--------

What I am thinking is to have a single PR (the once created by the author).

Once a Twisted team member has reviewed/checked the PR, a message like
"Go, Buildbot, go!" can be left as a comment and the Buildbot GH hook
will trigger the stable tests for that branch.

In this way, buildbot runs are only triggered for external branches
after a core team member has checked the code and assure that no
malware is contained.

With GitHub we can do changs to any forked repos... so if small
changes are required, Twisted team members can push directly to the
external forks... not sure if this is a feature or a security bug :)

---------

What do you think?
Do you see any problem in this?
Will such a change make life easier for you?

I should be able to update the current GH Buildbot hook to handle the
proposed change.

No backlog right now but what about most of the rest of the time?  Monday
at 7AM ET is probably about the least busy possible time for travis.

This doesn't seem inherently bad, though you probably need per
*revision* signoff,
not per branch signoff.

Will it trigger the Buidlbot stable builders?

We can have something like: "Go, Buildbot, go for 1d32a23!" .

In the initial email I was thinking to use  "Go, Buildbot, go!" and to
trigger only the commit which was pushed before the comment.

So you need to let a comment each time you want to trigger the tests.
A comment will not automatically trigger any future commit.

But now that I am reviewing it, do we need to be that secure?

I was thinking to leverage the GitHub Contributor information and if
the author is a "Contributor" (a commit was previously accepted), it
is automatically trusted.

Thanks!

I believe buildbot will trigger a build on the branch being pushed, no need
for a separate PR. Then, because GitHub commit statuses are on the
_commit_, the PR should be green too if the build succeeds.

True. Thanks!

If it doesn't, there's probably no reason it *couldn't* (apart from the
obvious labor requirements).  I did think it already did everything you
wanted which is why I suggested it but I think you're right that's it's not
quite complete.

That seems fine to me - I just wanted it to be clear that the comment only
triggers the current HEAD of the branch (there's still a potential problem
since you can't ever know what the HEAD will be when you actually post the
comment but perhaps it's safe to ignore this possible attack).

Creating a way to delegate CI authority seems like a good idea, yes.
Perhaps the heuristic should not be exactly "one previously accepted
commit" but something along those lines seems sane.  You still probably
want a way to trigger a complete CI run for folks who haven't yet been
admitted into this set, though.

The PB interface is unmaintained and pretty much only still exists for IRC notifications (if I remember correctly); the process binding that port is Kenaan (the IRC bot).

https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin <https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin> is now a bit of a misnomer as it also supports JSON-RPC as well.  We should probably just check that the plugin is upgraded and use that.

Thanks for the info.
With XML/JSON RPC I should be able to get something.

--------

I have updated the github bot for my project to do GitHub label management.
I am using a slightly different Trac process than Twisted.

As a proof of concept, I can set the bot to be used for
twisted-infra/braid as for Braid we don't need to sync with Trac.

We can use it to get a hands-on experience on the label management
part, and once we agree on how it should behave,  I can look at
deploying a dedicated bot for Twisted and then update it to sync with
Trac.

What do you think?

PS: I am not deploying it into Twisted infra now as for me
twisted-infra/braid and vagrant vm is broken... working on fixing it

I'd like to add an example of this to the documentation examples,

We have to close http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/288 before we can
implement CONNECT.  So no, no has implemented it yet :(

However, I think Craig meant a reverse proxy that terminates TLS. 
That's more common than forwarding TLS connections to backends.

Amber's written an HTTP proxy that terminates TLS, and even handles all
Let's Encrypt paper work:

https://github.com/hawkowl/rproxy

Even shorter:  put this in "reverse.rpy":


from twisted.web import proxy
resource = proxy.ReverseProxyResource('localhost', 9999, '')


Then, run it like so:

twist web --port
ssl:port=4443:privateKey=/path/to/privateKey.key:/path/to/certKey=certificate.crt
--resource-script=reverse.rpy

Requests to port 4443 will terminate the TLS connection and be forwarded
to a web server running on localhost:9999.

This assumes you have a private key and certificate already.  If not,
it's easier to use rproxy.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Clarification or pausing a consumer
Message-ID: <7964087.cE9iTWCf5K@barry-scott-desktop>

I have a app that needs to send data as an http response. But the data is 
produced slowly. More slowly then the time taken to transmit it.

The consumer keeps calling resumeProducing, but there is no data to send 
often.

What is the correct way to pause the consumer so that it does not keep
calling resumeProducing? unregisterProducer?

Then when the next block of data is available what is the correct way to
resume the consumer? registerProducer?

Related to that why does HTTPChannel.registerProducer convert a IPullProducer 
into a IPushProducer using _PullToPush?

This sounds like a bug in the consumer.  There are two cases.

If the producer is "streaming" or "push" (two words, one meaning) then the
consumer should call resumeProducing once and let data come.  If it wants
to slow down the data, it can call pauseProducing.  There's nothing else it
should be doing.

If the producer is "not streaming" or "pull" (again, one meaning) then the
consumer should call resumeProducing and wait for a write call.  Then it
should call resumeProducing again (if it wants more data).  It should not
call resumeProducing again while waiting for a write call.

Probably just fix the consumer implementation to not be broken.  Or switch
to tubes which has a simpler model and (in principle) fewer places to make
mistakes.

Probably as an attempt to simplify the implementation - to make it so the
consumer can pretend there's just one kind of producer instead of two
(which would be nice for everyone).

This is the good kind of producer.

This is the bad kind.  It is basically pointless.  It was a design error to include it and it should be removed from Twisted eventually.

My guess is not that the consumer is broken, but rather, you registered your producer as the bad kind of producer ("pull") and it's just doing as it was told, which is to keep calling resumeProducing over and over again every time it wants data.

Let us know how it works out!

Message-ID: <CAG=rPVdTaZxxhR2n+d7AbLFso971B+r3+rgXrit=TbsVX3JxZw@mail.gmail.com>

I worked with Zachary Ware, who maintains the buildbots for python.org.
Zachary upgraded python.org's  buildbot from 0.8 to 0.9:

https://www.python.org/dev/buildbot/

buildbot 0.9 is the first release of buildbot that
can run on Python 3.  The python.org buildbot master is running on Python
3.4:

http://buildbot.python.org/all/#/about

That master is connected to multiple workers/slaves, most of which are
0.8 running on Python 2:

http://buildbot.python.org/all/#/workers

This upgrade could not have been possible without the
porting of Twisted PB to Python 3.

This is a highly visible deployment of Twisted running Python 3,
and aligns with python.org's direction to move the world to Python 3. :)

Hi,


I have an important question about twisted HTTPS client-server communication.


I ran an HTTPS server with my own certs and tried to communicate with a twisted HTTPS client with the specific cert.


I am getting an error that says: "Invalid DNS-ID".


all the error info with all my code is in here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e46d4d8dc1c102857497cde9e2fc4725#file-gistfile1-txt

I will be appreciate if someone has a clue how can I fix this error.

Message-ID: <CAFwN=+yWpbqt8kanoYhP86AQgaJ9Z5i35AxsSQi4tx2OE9fZCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Sorry in advance for sending this to both Twisted mailing list. i was
not sure for which was it was most appropriate.

I have a design in which I would like to have a Twisted Application
which would periodically connect to a REST Server to pull
configuration information, i.e. as client and upon receiving that
information and processing would communicate spawn 1 or more clients
connecting to local process via Unix sockets to send them
configuration information.
I think I understand how the standard approach would be:
1. create a function that would be called with callLater/LoopingCall
2. in that function create my client, connect to the REST Server, get
info etc...

So:
1. Do you think my approach is correct? Essentially as explained I
need a service/daemon to periodically connect ot one server to pull
information and then connect to other local process to forward them
the relevant configuration.
2. How do I turn this into a twisted plugin? (daemon)


Thanks
-Daniel

Oh. This is surprising to here what is the rational behind this "good" vs. 
"bad"?

My use case is that I'm a proxy and I can only produce what has been received 
from the other side.

A hard CPU loop calling resumeProducing is not appropiate for this use case.

I had to work around what looked like a bug that the streaming parameter is 
ignored and call unregisterProducer/registedProduced to get back usable 
behaviour.

What makes it "bad" is that it creates extra work for every consumer
implementation.  The extra work is implementing largely the same thing
every time so it's also redundant work.  The logic for knowing when to call
resumeProducing again is always exactly the same regardless of the
consumer.  It doesn't belong inside every consumer.

This sounds like it should be a push producer to me.

This is appropriate behavior for neither kind of producer.  As I wrote in
my first reply, a consumer with a pull ("not streaming", "bad") producer
should call resumeProducing once and then wait until write is called on
it.  After write is called on it, it may call resumeProducing again if it
wants.

o.k. I see. So you want to have the consumer logic implemented once and
reused as needed?

But that is what happens is you convert a push to a pull which is why I 
noticed this.

It sure looks like a bug to give me that API that is the shape to take push or 
pull but inside then force into pull.

Hi,

I am using a self-signed CA to issue server and client(s) certificates.

My server is using the standard Python ssl module.
One client, that is using twisted.internet.ssl, consistently fails to connect with:
On the Server:    [SSL: TLSV1_ALERT_UNKNOWN_CA] tlsv1 alert unknown ca (_ssl.c:661),
On the Client:    [WARNING] [('SSL routines', 'tls_process_server_certificate', 'certificate verify failed')]

This is my code:

path = getModule(__name__).filePath.sibling(u'data')

txt = path.child(u'ca.crt').getContent()
cacert = ssl.Certificate.loadPEM(txt)
root = ssl.trustRootFromCertificates([cacert])

txt = path.child(u'client.pem').getContent()
mycert = ssl.PrivateCertificate.loadPEM(txt)

ctx = ssl.optionsForClientTLS(hostName, trustRoot=root, clientCertificate=mycert)

reactor.connectSSL(hostName, portNumber, factory, ctx)


I am using the latest git trunk code.
With a regular ssl client I don't have an issue.

A known bug?

Thanks, Enoch.

Hello Enoch,
A question, does the server have an intermediate cert that it is using?  
If so, then the problem might be that your trust root needs both the CA 
and intermediate.

I have some https test code I hacked together a while back (neither
reviewed nor heavily tested, but same general idea).
https://github.com/jlitzingerdev/twisted-benchmarks/blob/https-benchmark/web_https.py

If I omit the intermediate cert I get the same error.

I would review a few things before suspecting a bug.

Your code is using client side certificates (nice, not often seen) so both server and client need to validate each other's certificates on connection establishment. It seems they are both failing, but we're only looking at your client code though.

Here are a few ideas:

1. Double check your certificates: Issuers, Subjects, Dates, SANs, etc.

2. Check that the hostName in optionsForClientTLS matches the name in the server certificate.

3. Use the latest Twisted release instead of trunk, if possible.
   Do the same for pyOpenSSL and other dependencies.

4. On the client side try using SSL4ClientEndpoint instead of connectSSL.
   I'm almost sure they behave differently regarding validation (could not quickly find
   docs on that, though: I've had your problem before and I think I addressed it this way).

   Instead of reactor.connectSSL(...) go for something like:

   ep = endpoints.SSL4ClientEndpoint(
       reactor,
       host=hostName,
       port=portNumber,
       sslContextFactory=ctx,
   )
   client = yield ep.connect(factory)

   For completeness, even though my client skeleton is mostly your client code with
   this diff, a quick test shows that my client also establishes the TLS connection
   if I do the reverse: replace SSL4ClientEndpoint with connectSSL in my code.

   This may not be the culprit, but I would try and see if anything changes.

5. On the server side I have the following Twisted code skeleton:

   dhFile = filepath.FilePath(...)
   dhParams = ssl.DiffieHellmanParameters.fromFile(dhFile)
   caCert = ssl.Certificate.loadPEM(...)
   privateCert = ssl.PrivateCertificate.loadPEM(...)
   cf = ssl.CertificateOptions(
       privateKey=privateCert.privateKey.original,
       certificate=privateCert.original,
       trustRoot=caCert,
       dhParameters=dhParams,
   )
   ep = endpoints.SSL4ServerEndpoint(
       reactor,
       port=...,
       sslContextFactory=cf,
   )
   f = protocol.Factory.forProtocol(...)
   ep.listen(f)
   reactor.run()

   Your code is obviously different, if based on the standard library's ssl module.
   If 1 to 4 don't produce results, this is a good candidate for needing some work.
   Can you share a minimal version of that? I'll be glad to take it for a spin.

6. Double check your certificates, again. Triple-check them if managed manually.


For completeness and reference:
- See http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/ssl.html as a starting point
  Twisted TLS, containing useful information and working examples.
- My working test environment runs Linux with OpenSSL 1.0.1t.

Thanks Jason,

With a more specific error message raised by github latest code [thanks!] the problem became clear.
I suggest to change the documentation of 'optionsForClientTLS' -

from:
ctx = ssl.optionsForClientTLS(hostName, trustRoot=root, clientCertificate=mycert)

to:
ctx = ssl.optionsForClientTLS(commonName, trustRoot=root, clientCertificate=mycert)

That is, what this ctx (the contextFactory) really expects is the server's certificate commonName which often is, but not in my case, the server's hostName.

Interestingly, Python's standard ssl package does not verify this field.

Regards, Enoch.

You are welcome.

That would be misleading:

Keep in mind that the name validation will be performed against the server certificate's SANs (subject alternative name) entries, if they exist. More importantly, in the context of your suggestion: as far as I can tell, when SANs are present in the server certificate, not only will the name verification be performed against those, but the certificate's subject commonName will be ignored. IIRC, this is in line with an existing RFC recommendation (maybe 6125?).

Thus, hostName is a pretty good name and commonName wouldn't be as good. :)

It sounds like you somehow installed Twisted without the "service_identity" module; it only verifies commonName if it has no other choice.

When you install Twisted, be sure to install the `tls` extra: pip install twisted[tls].

Currently, GitHub Issues don't allow for non-committers to make modifications to categories, milestones, edit the original ticket description, or close tickets. This kinda sucks, because it makes the pool of triagers smaller, and also makes most obvious review queue methods harder (adding a category).

I think Mark Williams or someone has hacked up a bot to sidestep this, but... again, contributor effort to get that past the line.

Are there enough non-committers to Twisted who are actively doing this
right now, to make this
as big an issue as you are claiming?  My guess is no.
Other projects related to klein and treq are using GitHub to track issues
instead of Trac.
Do those projects have problem with non-committers triaging issues, despite
the inability to
create/modify categories/milestones, etc.?

I'm a little confused.  What do you mean by "process / workflow / markers" if not "the things required to accept a PR or do a review"?

Mark Williams already started working on this: https://github.com/markrwilliams/txghbot

We should have more verbiage around the comment stuff, including the "always say thank you twice" rule which I don't think is written down anywhere :-).

>> Reviewing: This is the potentially slightly odd part.  I believe a review that doesn't result in acceptance should close the PR.  We need to be careful to always include some text that explains that closing a PR does not mean that the change is rejected, just that the submitter must re-submit.  Initially this would just mean opening a new PR, but Mark Williams is working on a bot to re-open pull requests when a submitter posts a "please review" comment: https://github.com/markrwilliams/txghbot

Yep!

I still want to require people to open an issue first so we can separate closing PRs ("this patch is too bad to be accepted, please try again") from closing tickets or issues ("we do not want to do this work").

I can update https://twisted.reviews/ <https://twisted.reviews/> (at some point) when to point at the appropriate link.  (You've all got it bookmarked, right?)

"Poorly" :-).

A failure mode of many open source projects is that they have terrible latency when responding to new contributors.

Cryptography is kind of a weird project with a somewhat rarified contributor audience, I don't know if it makes sense to copy their process.

"Submit for review" is such an action, so, yes.

Yes.  It's a huge issue.  If I didn't have a regular task to manually comb those trackers I don't know if anything would get looked at; I have nothing to point others at other than "just randomly peruse the list of open issues".  Trac is hot garbage but I miss it every time I have to look at my not-quite-working ad-hoc query to figure out what the workflow state on everything there is.

That said: if we could get this ALL into github, then we could write ONE query that would be the full review queue for all Twisted org projects.  And that would be amazing, a huge upgrade from what we've got now.

Finishing txghbot is probably not a ton of work, but it's not zero either.

To be clear, because I am grumpy about a lot of specifics with respect to GH issues: I agree with this and I hope it can happen.

The major missing feature, as discussed in the PR thread, is the ability to record the separate workflow state of "needs review" / "needs feedback addressed" as distinct from "open" / "closed".  A bot that could do this would address more or less the entire issue.

One issue which I haven't seen raised here is the need to maintain a redirection service, to ensure that the massive amount of information currently recorded in commit messages and emails linking to existing trac issues is not lost.

While, in general, I strongly agree with this, and I would personally very much like to operate less infrastructure, there is the fact that the twistedmatrix.com <http://twistedmatrix.com/> website has served as a very important dogfooding resource for us in the past.  We've found and fixed dozens of bugs in Twisted due to our constant, intense use of it.

That said, this is not really an argument against doing this.  Maybe if we didn't have to operate something as old and clunky as Trac we could invest our dogfooding effort in new, cool web toys where the effort was writing and debugging code using Twisted and not shell scripts to restart zombie processes.  I just think it's important to consider how the developer community can continue to use Twisted itself as part of this process.

Rather than write a bot specific to Twisted, why not just adapt the Twisted
project to use a bot written by another project?

For example, the Zulip project has written zulipbot:

https://github.com/zulip/zulipbot#zulipbot

Docs for it are here:

http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zulipbot-usage.html

and a presentation for it was given here:

http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1992

A lot of the motivations for zulipbot are similar to what the Twisted
project is facing:
https://github.com/zulip/zulipbot/wiki/FAQ

such as giving non-committers the ability to add labels to issues or PR's.

zulipbot is actively used, and you can see it in action in their issues and
PR's:
https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20or%20is%3Apull

I've met some of the Zulip developers at Pybay.  They are really focused on
improving developer experience and
onboarding of new developers.  Rather than maintain our own bot, the
Twisted project would probably
get further along with zulipbot, and working with the zulip developers to
fill in any missing gaps on that bot.

Personally I don't care either way :-).  I was just describing my understanding of the existing plan, not endorsing it.  Hopefully someone more directly involved will comment.

I expect that in order to make this happen, we will need a transition
period in which the current system should continue to work, that is
automatically set/remove "review" keyword to Trac.
In this way, the new way(tm) can be implemented in various ways (and
experiment with different ways) and nobody should complain as the old
system will just work.

For my project, I am using Klein as the hooks server, but it is based
on Trac XML-RPC, so I don't think it can be used for Twisted.

---------------

With that in mind, I think that txghbot or something based on
python/twisted is easier.
We would need to talk with Trac... maybe over PB

I remember there was a PB based channel for communicating with Trac
but I can't find where it is defined.
I see that kenan is using something [1] BOT_PORT = 15243, I can't find
where a service with that port is started.

Regards,
Adi

Message-ID: <CAFycZ9cKbGZ3oYSy3mRGM35O0SuO1A-Kj1n2dE8R_qf_RbJ2mg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

1. Are Travis OSX builds functional yet? Can we switch to Travis for
OSX builder?

Over https://www.traviscistatus.com/ I see no backlog for macOS.

------------

2. Right now, when we receive a PR from a non-team member, I think
that the only way to trigger the required tests is to create a new
branch in twisted/twisted.

Then you can go to
https://buildbot.twistedmatrix.com/boxes-supported?branch=9176-inlinetracebacks-tardyp
and force the tests.

This looks complicated, so what I was doing, is create a new PR.

--------

Am I doing something wrong?
Is there a simple way?
Am I the only one who thinks this is not productive?

--------

What I am thinking is to have a single PR (the once created by the author).

Once a Twisted team member has reviewed/checked the PR, a message like
"Go, Buildbot, go!" can be left as a comment and the Buildbot GH hook
will trigger the stable tests for that branch.

In this way, buildbot runs are only triggered for external branches
after a core team member has checked the code and assure that no
malware is contained.

With GitHub we can do changs to any forked repos... so if small
changes are required, Twisted team members can push directly to the
external forks... not sure if this is a feature or a security bug :)

---------

What do you think?
Do you see any problem in this?
Will such a change make life easier for you?

I should be able to update the current GH Buildbot hook to handle the
proposed change.

No backlog right now but what about most of the rest of the time?  Monday
at 7AM ET is probably about the least busy possible time for travis.

This doesn't seem inherently bad, though you probably need per

not per branch signoff.

We can have something like: "Go, Buildbot, go for 1d32a23!" .

In the initial email I was thinking to use  "Go, Buildbot, go!" and to
trigger only the commit which was pushed before the comment.

So you need to let a comment each time you want to trigger the tests.
A comment will not automatically trigger any future commit.

But now that I am reviewing it, do we need to be that secure?

I was thinking to leverage the GitHub Contributor information and if
the author is a "Contributor" (a commit was previously accepted), it
is automatically trusted.

Thanks!

I believe buildbot will trigger a build on the branch being pushed, no need
for a separate PR. Then, because GitHub commit statuses are on the
_commit_, the PR should be green too if the build succeeds.

If it doesn't, there's probably no reason it *couldn't* (apart from the
obvious labor requirements).  I did think it already did everything you
wanted which is why I suggested it but I think you're right that's it's not
quite complete.

That seems fine to me - I just wanted it to be clear that the comment only
triggers the current HEAD of the branch (there's still a potential problem
since you can't ever know what the HEAD will be when you actually post the
comment but perhaps it's safe to ignore this possible attack).

Creating a way to delegate CI authority seems like a good idea, yes.
Perhaps the heuristic should not be exactly "one previously accepted
commit" but something along those lines seems sane.  You still probably
want a way to trigger a complete CI run for folks who haven't yet been
admitted into this set, though.

The PB interface is unmaintained and pretty much only still exists for IRC notifications (if I remember correctly); the process binding that port is Kenaan (the IRC bot).

https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin <https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin> is now a bit of a misnomer as it also supports JSON-RPC as well.  We should probably just check that the plugin is upgraded and use that.

Thanks for the info.
With XML/JSON RPC I should be able to get something.

--------

I have updated the github bot for my project to do GitHub label management.
I am using a slightly different Trac process than Twisted.

As a proof of concept, I can set the bot to be used for
twisted-infra/braid as for Braid we don't need to sync with Trac.

We can use it to get a hands-on experience on the label management
part, and once we agree on how it should behave,  I can look at
deploying a dedicated bot for Twisted and then update it to sync with
Trac.

What do you think?

PS: I am not deploying it into Twisted infra now as for me
twisted-infra/braid and vagrant vm is broken... working on fixing it

Hi,

Can someone give me a short snippet for how to set
up a HTTPS reverse proxy using twistd, twist, or twisted.web ?

I'd like to add an example of this to the documentation examples,
since it is a pretty common thing to do these days.

We have to close http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/288 before we can
implement CONNECT.  So no, no has implemented it yet :(

However, I think Craig meant a reverse proxy that terminates TLS. 
That's more common than forwarding TLS connections to backends.

Amber's written an HTTP proxy that terminates TLS, and even handles all
Let's Encrypt paper work:

https://github.com/hawkowl/rproxy

Even shorter:  put this in "reverse.rpy":


from twisted.web import proxy
resource = proxy.ReverseProxyResource('localhost', 9999, '')


Then, run it like so:

twist web --port
ssl:port=4443:privateKey=/path/to/privateKey.key:/path/to/certKey=certificate.crt
--resource-script=reverse.rpy

Requests to port 4443 will terminate the TLS connection and be forwarded
to a web server running on localhost:9999.

This assumes you have a private key and certificate already.  If not,
it's easier to use rproxy.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Clarification or pausing a consumer
Message-ID: <7964087.cE9iTWCf5K@barry-scott-desktop>

I have a app that needs to send data as an http response. But the data is 
produced slowly. More slowly then the time taken to transmit it.

The consumer keeps calling resumeProducing, but there is no data to send 
often.

What is the correct way to pause the consumer so that it does not keep
calling resumeProducing? unregisterProducer?

Then when the next block of data is available what is the correct way to
resume the consumer? registerProducer?

Related to that why does HTTPChannel.registerProducer convert a IPullProducer 
into a IPushProducer using _PullToPush?

This sounds like a bug in the consumer.  There are two cases.

If the producer is "streaming" or "push" (two words, one meaning) then the
consumer should call resumeProducing once and let data come.  If it wants
to slow down the data, it can call pauseProducing.  There's nothing else it
should be doing.

If the producer is "not streaming" or "pull" (again, one meaning) then the
consumer should call resumeProducing and wait for a write call.  Then it
should call resumeProducing again (if it wants more data).  It should not
call resumeProducing again while waiting for a write call.

Probably just fix the consumer implementation to not be broken.  Or switch
to tubes which has a simpler model and (in principle) fewer places to make
mistakes.

Probably as an attempt to simplify the implementation - to make it so the
consumer can pretend there's just one kind of producer instead of two
(which would be nice for everyone).

This is the good kind of producer.

This is the bad kind.  It is basically pointless.  It was a design error to include it and it should be removed from Twisted eventually.

My guess is not that the consumer is broken, but rather, you registered your producer as the bad kind of producer ("pull") and it's just doing as it was told, which is to keep calling resumeProducing over and over again every time it wants data.

Let us know how it works out!

Message-ID: <CAG=rPVdTaZxxhR2n+d7AbLFso971B+r3+rgXrit=TbsVX3JxZw@mail.gmail.com>

I worked with Zachary Ware, who maintains the buildbots for python.org.
Zachary upgraded python.org's  buildbot from 0.8 to 0.9:

https://www.python.org/dev/buildbot/

buildbot 0.9 is the first release of buildbot that
can run on Python 3.  The python.org buildbot master is running on Python
3.4:

http://buildbot.python.org/all/#/about

That master is connected to multiple workers/slaves, most of which are
0.8 running on Python 2:

http://buildbot.python.org/all/#/workers

This upgrade could not have been possible without the
porting of Twisted PB to Python 3.

This is a highly visible deployment of Twisted running Python 3,
and aligns with python.org's direction to move the world to Python 3. :)

Hi,


I have an important question about twisted HTTPS client-server communication.


I ran an HTTPS server with my own certs and tried to communicate with a twisted HTTPS client with the specific cert.


I am getting an error that says: "Invalid DNS-ID".


all the error info with all my code is in here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e46d4d8dc1c102857497cde9e2fc4725#file-gistfile1-txt

I will be appreciate if someone has a clue how can I fix this error.


Thanks,

Message-ID: <CAFwN=+yWpbqt8kanoYhP86AQgaJ9Z5i35AxsSQi4tx2OE9fZCA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Sorry in advance for sending this to both Twisted mailing list. i was
not sure for which was it was most appropriate.

I have a design in which I would like to have a Twisted Application
which would periodically connect to a REST Server to pull
configuration information, i.e. as client and upon receiving that
information and processing would communicate spawn 1 or more clients
connecting to local process via Unix sockets to send them
configuration information.
I think I understand how the standard approach would be:
1. create a function that would be called with callLater/LoopingCall
2. in that function create my client, connect to the REST Server, get
info etc...

So:
1. Do you think my approach is correct? Essentially as explained I
need a service/daemon to periodically connect ot one server to pull
information and then connect to other local process to forward them
the relevant configuration.
2. How do I turn this into a twisted plugin? (daemon)


Thanks
-Daniel

Oh. This is surprising to here what is the rational behind this "good" vs. 
"bad"?

My use case is that I'm a proxy and I can only produce what has been received 
from the other side.

A hard CPU loop calling resumeProducing is not appropiate for this use case.

I had to work around what looked like a bug that the streaming parameter is 
ignored and call unregisterProducer/registedProduced to get back usable 
behaviour.

What makes it "bad" is that it creates extra work for every consumer
implementation.  The extra work is implementing largely the same thing
every time so it's also redundant work.  The logic for knowing when to call
resumeProducing again is always exactly the same regardless of the
consumer.  It doesn't belong inside every consumer.

This sounds like it should be a push producer to me.

This is appropriate behavior for neither kind of producer.  As I wrote in
my first reply, a consumer with a pull ("not streaming", "bad") producer
should call resumeProducing once and then wait until write is called on
it.  After write is called on it, it may call resumeProducing again if it
wants.

o.k. I see. So you want to have the consumer logic implemented once and
reused as needed?

But that is what happens is you convert a push to a pull which is why I 
noticed this.

It sure looks like a bug to give me that API that is the shape to take push or 
pull but inside then force into pull.

Hi,

I am using a self-signed CA to issue server and client(s) certificates.

My server is using the standard Python ssl module.
One client, that is using twisted.internet.ssl, consistently fails to connect with:
On the Server:    [SSL: TLSV1_ALERT_UNKNOWN_CA] tlsv1 alert unknown ca (_ssl.c:661),
On the Client:    [WARNING] [('SSL routines', 'tls_process_server_certificate', 'certificate verify failed')]

This is my code:

path = getModule(__name__).filePath.sibling(u'data')

txt = path.child(u'ca.crt').getContent()
cacert = ssl.Certificate.loadPEM(txt)
root = ssl.trustRootFromCertificates([cacert])

txt = path.child(u'client.pem').getContent()
mycert = ssl.PrivateCertificate.loadPEM(txt)

ctx = ssl.optionsForClientTLS(hostName, trustRoot=root, clientCertificate=mycert)

reactor.connectSSL(hostName, portNumber, factory, ctx)


I am using the latest git trunk code.
With a regular ssl client I don't have an issue.

A known bug?

Thanks, Enoch.

Hello Enoch,
A question, does the server have an intermediate cert that it is using?  
If so, then the problem might be that your trust root needs both the CA 
and intermediate.

I have some https test code I hacked together a while back (neither
reviewed nor heavily tested, but same general idea).

If I omit the intermediate cert I get the same error.

I would review a few things before suspecting a bug.

Your code is using client side certificates (nice, not often seen) so both server and client need to validate each other's certificates on connection establishment. It seems they are both failing, but we're only looking at your client code though.

Here are a few ideas:

1. Double check your certificates: Issuers, Subjects, Dates, SANs, etc.

2. Check that the hostName in optionsForClientTLS matches the name in the server certificate.

3. Use the latest Twisted release instead of trunk, if possible.
   Do the same for pyOpenSSL and other dependencies.

4. On the client side try using SSL4ClientEndpoint instead of connectSSL.
   I'm almost sure they behave differently regarding validation (could not quickly find
   docs on that, though: I've had your problem before and I think I addressed it this way).

   Instead of reactor.connectSSL(...) go for something like:

   ep = endpoints.SSL4ClientEndpoint(
       reactor,
       host=hostName,
       port=portNumber,
       sslContextFactory=ctx,
   )
   client = yield ep.connect(factory)

   For completeness, even though my client skeleton is mostly your client code with
   this diff, a quick test shows that my client also establishes the TLS connection
   if I do the reverse: replace SSL4ClientEndpoint with connectSSL in my code.

   This may not be the culprit, but I would try and see if anything changes.

5. On the server side I have the following Twisted code skeleton:

   dhFile = filepath.FilePath(...)
   dhParams = ssl.DiffieHellmanParameters.fromFile(dhFile)
   caCert = ssl.Certificate.loadPEM(...)
   privateCert = ssl.PrivateCertificate.loadPEM(...)
   cf = ssl.CertificateOptions(
       privateKey=privateCert.privateKey.original,
       certificate=privateCert.original,
       trustRoot=caCert,
       dhParameters=dhParams,
   )
   ep = endpoints.SSL4ServerEndpoint(
       reactor,
       port=...,
       sslContextFactory=cf,
   )
   f = protocol.Factory.forProtocol(...)
   ep.listen(f)
   reactor.run()

   Your code is obviously different, if based on the standard library's ssl module.
   If 1 to 4 don't produce results, this is a good candidate for needing some work.
   Can you share a minimal version of that? I'll be glad to take it for a spin.

6. Double check your certificates, again. Triple-check them if managed manually.


For completeness and reference:
- See http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/ssl.html as a starting point
  Twisted TLS, containing useful information and working examples.
- My working test environment runs Linux with OpenSSL 1.0.1t.

Thanks Jason,

With a more specific error message raised by github latest code [thanks!] the problem became clear.
I suggest to change the documentation of 'optionsForClientTLS' -

from:
ctx = ssl.optionsForClientTLS(hostName, trustRoot=root, clientCertificate=mycert)

to:
ctx = ssl.optionsForClientTLS(commonName, trustRoot=root, clientCertificate=mycert)

That is, what this ctx (the contextFactory) really expects is the server's certificate commonName which often is, but not in my case, the server's hostName.

Interestingly, Python's standard ssl package does not verify this field.

Regards, Enoch.

Hi,

I am using a self-signed CA to issue server and client(s) certificates.

My server is using the standard Python ssl module.
One client, that is using twisted.internet.ssl, consistently fails to connect with:

On the Client:    [WARNING] [('SSL routines', 'tls_process_server_certificate', 'certificate verify failed')]

This is my code:

path = getModule(__name__).filePath.sibling(u'data')

txt = path.child(u'ca.crt').getContent()
cacert = ssl.Certificate.loadPEM(txt)
root = ssl.trustRootFromCertificates([cacert])

txt = path.child(u'client.pem').getContent()
mycert = ssl.PrivateCertificate.loadPEM(txt)

ctx = ssl.optionsForClientTLS(hostName, trustRoot=root, clientCertificate=mycert)

reactor.connectSSL(hostName, portNumber, factory, ctx)


I am using the latest git trunk code.
With a regular ssl client I don't have an issue.

A known bug?

You are welcome.

That would be misleading:

Keep in mind that the name validation will be performed against the server certificate's SANs (subject alternative name) entries, if they exist. More importantly, in the context of your suggestion: as far as I can tell, when SANs are present in the server certificate, not only will the name verification be performed against those, but the certificate's subject commonName will be ignored. IIRC, this is in line with an existing RFC recommendation (maybe 6125?).

Thus, hostName is a pretty good name and commonName wouldn't be as good. :)

It sounds like you somehow installed Twisted without the "service_identity" module; it only verifies commonName if it has no other choice.

When you install Twisted, be sure to install the `tls` extra: pip install twisted[tls].
