Good catch, that probably should have been announced at least a little :).

&gt;<i> (Not mentioned in the NEWS file, INSTALL, etc.)

Despite the fact that it would have been good to mention this particular dependency because its adoption is a new architectural direction for Twisted, in general we're actually planning to do less communication of dependencies in this way.  Right now, we have redundant listing of dependencies in a few places, but in the future, setup.py (or more specifically, &quot;packaging metadata&quot;) will be the one, authoritative place that such things are listed.

&gt;<i> I found Automat 0.3.0 (with Glyph's fingerprints on it) at PyPI, but it only exists in .whl format.
</I>
Although you probably should just use the wheel, the fact that there was only a wheel was an oversight.  I've uploaded an sdist and pushed a corresponding tag (after making sure that the source files all matched, of course).

&gt;<i> Downloaded it, but I'm not sure what to do next.  [...] This is worrisome to me because I think this requires Internet access to pypi.python.org, which I have on my development and testing systems, but not on my production systems.  Everything else I've ever needed, I could download and install source files.
</I>

As Amber already explained, the ability to deploy offline is very much an important part of the pip/wheel ecosystem.  I went into some detail in one of my own blog posts on this: <A HREF="https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2015/03/docker-deploy-double-dutch.html">https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2015/03/docker-deploy-double-dutch.html</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2015/03/docker-deploy-double-dutch.html">https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2015/03/docker-deploy-double-dutch.html</A>&gt;

Increasingly, we are assuming a pip-like packaging toolchain for dealing with Twisted's dependencies, so getting familiar with this stuff - pip, requirements.txt, pinning, virtualenv - is worthwhile.  (It'll make your life easier in more ways than one.)  It should handily meet all your requirements for security and flexibility, and if it doesn't, we have a good working relationship with the maintainers of all those tools so we'd like to hear about if it's a problem :).

&gt;<i> Having done this, my app seems to run fine (only quick sanity testing so far.)
</I>
Thanks for testing!
