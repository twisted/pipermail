</I>&gt;<i> secsh is a module for python 2.3 that implements the SSH2 protocol for

</I>&gt;<i> unlike SSL (aka TLS), SSH2 protocol does not require heirarchical

</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary channels to remote services across the encrypted tunnel 
</I>&gt;<i> (this is how sftp works, for example).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the module works by taking a socket-like object that you pass in, 
</I>&gt;<i> negotiating with the remote server, authenticating (using a password 
</I>&gt;<i> or a given private key), and opening flow-controled &quot;channels&quot; to the 
</I>&gt;<i> server, which are returned as socket-like objects. you are responsible 
</I>&gt;<i> for verifying that the server's host key is the one you expected to 
</I>&gt;<i> see, and you have control over which kinds of encryption or hashing 
</I>&gt;<i> you prefer (if you care), but all of the heavy lifting is done by the 
</I>&gt;<i> secsh module.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it is written entirely in python (no C or platform-dependent code) and 
</I>&gt;<i> is released under the GNU LGPL (lesser GPL).

I emailed the secsh guy to make sure he was aware of conch, but I 
received no reply.
