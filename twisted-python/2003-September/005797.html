</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The initial prototype I posted only took a few hours because I used 
resources rather than woven (which is great but is more time-consuming 
when I just wanted to get html on the screen to test an idea)

If people are interested in this pattern I would definitely write it 
either on top of, or extending woven.

&gt;<i>     - What are your use cases?  e.g. what kind of a site benefits from 
</I>&gt;<i> using Crystals, and what doesn't?
</I>
It had no use-cases when I started, I just wanted to test an idea.

However, I could see the 'crystals' pattern being of major benefit in a 
site that is highly modular, such as a groupware application/portal 
where individual modules are often written totally separately and turned 
on/off with user prefs.

The site could have an API of broadcasters/observers, its own internal 
event system or whatever (a broadcasting reactor?). A module developer 
would only need to write a few facets and perhaps a prism to access the 
sites events and to get their info on the screen, in whatever way the 
site wants modules to be displayed.
