<PRE>This email is bases on comment from <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5999">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5999</A>

I fail to see the reason why SSHTransportAddress exist and why would
anyone need It.

SSHTransportAddress is an IAddress which has a single member called
&quot;address&quot; and which is an IAddress ...

In case SSHTransportAddress is useful and people should start using
it, maybe this is a bug in SSHTransportAddress documentation as it
should stat why someone want to use it instead of directly using any
address define in twisted.internet.address

SSHTransportAddress was introduced in this ticket
<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2997">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/2997</A> and since it was reviewed
and approved by 2 other persons, I guess that I am the only one
failing to understand
to purpose of this class.

Thanks!
