The PyQt team insists that the PyQt license is incompatible with 
Twisted's license (this is an intentional simplification, you can read 
more about the issue on PyQt's website if you really care).

Since PySide now exists this is potentially no longer an issue. 
However, the last thing I heard about using PySide to run the Qt reactor 
is that it segfaulted sometimes.

So perhaps the reason is that someone needs to do some work to determine 
if PySide is actually safe to use with the Qt reactor now and, if it is, 
shuffle some code around.

However, I'm not even sure if the GUI reactors *should* be distributed 
as part of the main Twisted package.  They are already first-class 
reactors via the plugin system.  Independent releases let them track 
changes in the GUI library they're each concerned with more quickly than 
they could if they were part of Twisted itself.

Perhaps there are other reasons, like simplicity of packaging or quality 
of continuous integration testing, that would override those issues and 
make it worth bringing Qt reactor back into Twisted.  Sorting that out 
is also a task that requires someone interested to step up an do some 
work, though. :)
