That section of the docs has not changed (current svn), and I
agree it's rather confusing to determine what the actual
recommendation is.  My impression was that the most recent
implementation of the wxreactor is supposed to work on all
platforms.  Is that not so?  If it is, this section of the
docs should probably be revised to recommend it more clearly.
