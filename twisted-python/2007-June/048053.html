Sounds like an interesting project.  With regards to bdb, in my experience
the Python bindings are very flaky, and the bdb API isn't very friendly in
the first place.  It is probably possible to write something that works on
bdb with Python, but it's pretty hard.  bdb does handle that scale well enough
though - I have a Twisted-based server running against a 21GB bdb database
at the moment (although we're trying to phase it out in favor of something
based on SQLite ;P).
