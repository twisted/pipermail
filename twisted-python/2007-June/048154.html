Ah, good point. I'll try that.

It is indeed being sent at the same time, but unfortunately I'm not  
designing the protocol. I'm implementing an existing one that only  
runs over HTTP.

&gt;<i> Also, I would look at making sure that you are not copying data

</I>
I was definitely paying attention to that. I'm using Python's  
`buffer` type when possible to prevent any duplication of data;  
ideally, there's only one real copy of it in memory, and a bunch of  
buffers pointing to it... then it can be garbage collected once it's  
been sent to all clients.

&gt;<i> I must admit that my Knowledge of all the twisted classes that are

</I>&gt;<i> suggest dropping in to the low level classes below web2 since you will

</I>
I had similar thoughts... I was thinking, once I had the connection  
established, I could try to bypass web2's IByteStream stuff and try  
to use transport.write directly. Do you think that would help? It's  
less runloopy overhead, at least.
