This part is a bit short on detail.  &quot;relevant code&quot; isn't possible to determine
automatically, in general.  You never know what dependencies code might have.
Probably this user needs to be given some control over this, e.g. a setting for
the directory to copy (or rsync?).

I guess the trick will be that once a slave is set up to make sure that giving
it the current code for testing with is quick (copying the whole source for a
large project every time would suck, especially if you want to use a slave
that's on a relatively slow link).  rsync is definitely tempting here!

Another possible way to transfer the changes is as a branch URL, revision ID,
and diff.  i.e. the output of &quot;svn info | grep ^URL:&quot;, &quot;svn info | grep
^Revision:&quot; and &quot;svn diff&quot; for SVN checkouts (but keep in mind not all projects
use SVN, so if you go this route you'd want to make part extensible).

&gt;<i> 3. Find a good test-to-unique-id mapping (probably using FQPNs +
</I>&gt;<i> something else for test_suite-generated tests?)
</I>
The scheme discussed on #twisted along these lines sounded ok to me.

&gt;<i> I think that is all. Any thoughts? Comments?
</I>
Make sure that trial options that don't work when distributed give graceful
errors, rather than tracebacks or wrong results.  Options like &quot;--debug&quot; and
&quot;--coverage&quot; spring to mind, but there may be others.  Similarly, you should
also make sure that &quot;--until-failure&quot; does something sensible.  Basically,
look at each of the options described by &quot;trial --help&quot; and figure out what
distributed trial should do with it.  This is a relatively small thing, but this
sort of polish makes a big difference to the end user experience.

I also agree with L. Daniel Burr that there could be some overlap with Buildbot
in this project.  I guess you probably weren't thinking of running a master
daemon perpetually for slaves to connect to, but maybe that's not a crazy idea.
Also Buildbot has already deals with reporting results (in a minimal way),
updating source trees according to instructions from a master, and running
commands on those trees.  It also deals with managing slaves.

Because running tests requires a much more elaborately and carefully configured
environment than compiling a pre-processed C file, thinking about disttrial as
being more like buildbot than distcc might make good sense.

-Andrew.
