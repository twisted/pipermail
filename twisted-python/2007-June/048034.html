Not yet. Maybe in a few years...

Interesting, a bit like event binding in wxWidgets.

&gt;<i> If the way you handle events is mostly static, it is not a problem.
</I>
But it's not really the case. Events may have the same type, but are
needed in different places when the protocol state changes. Deferreds
fit well in this case.

&gt;<i> Qt is modular since 4.0, so you could use the network part without the GUI

</I>&gt;<i> popular network protocols. For the client side, KIO from KDE supports many
</I>&gt;<i> protocols, for the server side you'd probably have to write it yourself.
</I>
Well, both Qt and kio provide basic socket wrappers, but their
protocol frameworks seem completely geared toward filesystems or URLs.

I will use the financial FIX protocol. I am looking for a way to
implement new protocols.

Actually I already developed a bunch of classes that mimic part of the
twisted framework:
Deferreds, Protocols, Connectors, and a Reactor which provides
TcpTransport and callLater().
The reactor implementation is based on Windows MFC classes (and a
reactor based on select is under development)
It's far from complete, but it seems to work.

If someone is interested, I can try to clean up the code and share it...
