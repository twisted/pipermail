This is mainly why I am in favour of this plan. They’re not small fixes, so we can’t just mop them up in a day.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Delaying the revert is likely to just make things more painful.  Tempting as it is to suggest, bitter experience has taught me that trying to cram things into a release is a recipe for sadness.

*cough* 14.0 *cough* :)

&gt;<i> So rather than asking if you could hold off, could I instead make two requests for this feature:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	• Can please we do reviews of the fixes to the regressions as if they were landing on trunk, and not have this revert re-open the need to review the entire (rather large) change?
</I>
How are we going to manage this? Do we need an “alternate” branch, which consists of #6750 + all the regression fixes, and the “review” is making sure that all of the known regressions are fixed? Or do we remerge it as a “private” API, maybe, so that we can still fit it mostly into our dev process? Or do we do a tubes and just spin it off into another thing of its own, then merge it when it’s finished? I’m not sure.

&gt;<i> 	• If we can manage to get this feature landed again quickly after 14.1, will you have time to do a fast-following 14.2?
</I>
As long as it’s not the 22nd of November or the weekend of the 7th of Dec (the former of which will be spent in a drunk stupor and the latter is my birthday), I can do it no problem.
