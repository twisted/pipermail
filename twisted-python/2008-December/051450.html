Queued/threaded tasks?  That do what?

The way to do things after the reactor is running is the same as the way
to do things before the reactor is running.  Just do them.  There's no
difference.  If you're having trouble figuring out where to put the code
that does them, think about when you want the tasks done.  You said you
want to do things when you &quot;find messages&quot;.  How do you find messages?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I tried:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>reactor.callLater(0,self.some_method,object)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>but the method is not immediately invoked. It seems its not invoked at
</I>&gt;<i>all.
</I>
This will call `self.some_method(object)Â´ soon.  If the call is never
happening, then you've done something wrong.  Perhaps you didn't start
the reactor, or perhaps the signature of some_method is incompatible
with that invocation so that when the call was attempted, it just raised
a TypeError.  It's hard to say exactly what's wrong without seeing a
complete, self-contained, runnable example which demonstrates the
behavior.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I want to create a high-performance threaded scheduler using twist. Any
</I>&gt;<i>tips?
</I>
Think about ways to not use threads.  Anything you can do without threads
will be higher performance than the threaded equivalent.
