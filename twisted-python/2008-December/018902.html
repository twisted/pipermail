While this sometimes makes sense, it's usually *not* the approach you want
to take.  You're describing a solution which is essentially polling.  And
polling is not as good as responding to events.  You *could* run a function
ten times a second that looks around for a message to send and sends it if
it finds one.  Or, whatever event occurs which creates those messages could
just send the message instead of putting it in a pile and waiting for your
poller to find it.

I can't tell you how to do this in detail, though, since I don't know what
causes you to have messages to send.

&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Now, from trawling the docs, I guess that I want to call 
</I>&gt;<i>reactor.callWhenRunning...
</I>
Probably not.  If you want to run a function later (and that's how polling
is generally implemented), you want reactor.callLater.  If you want to run
a function repeatedly at a fixed interval, twisted.internet.task.LoopingCall
will help.

&gt;<i>but then I'd like to pass in a bound method of my 
</I>&gt;<i>B class, so it can call sendMessage on myself.  But I'm stumped as to how my 
</I>&gt;<i>B class is even being instantiated, let alone how to get a reference to that 
</I>&gt;<i>instance.  And the callWhenRunning idea is only a wild guess and probably 
</I>&gt;<i>wrong.
</I>
You'll probably encounter the same problem with reactor.callLater as you
were encountering with reactor.callWhenRunning, though.  How do you get
a reference to the bound method to pass in?  That's simple - don't call
the reactor method until you *have* an instance.  You can call almost any
reactor method even *after* the reactor is started; you do not have to set
everything up before you call reactor.run.

You can read more about reactor.callLater in the scheduling howto:
