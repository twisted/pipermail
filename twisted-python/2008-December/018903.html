Well, the thing is that there will actually be a great many things that 
could cause it to need to send a message, such as the time, a change in 
the outside temperature, a certain change in the value of a stock fund, 
etc.  And the AIM interface isn't the only interface to this bot.  So I 
really do think I need a way to call a function once every few seconds.

Now, that does suggest an alternative approach, which is to ignore 
twisted's event/idle mechanisms and use something external to it.  But 
I'm also fairly newish to Python, so I'm not sure exactly how to do that 
either -- reactor.run() is a blocking call, so I supposed I'd have to 
use threads.  Then my &quot;idler thread&quot; could call the idle function, sleep 
for a few seconds, and repeat.

But if there's a simple way to do this within Twisted, I'd like to learn 
what that is
.
&gt;&gt;<i> Now, from trawling the docs, I guess that I want to call

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Probably not.  If you want to run a function later (and that's how polling

</I>&gt;<i> twisted.internet.task.LoopingCall will help.
</I>
Thanks, I'll look at these.

&gt;<i> You'll probably encounter the same problem with reactor.callLater as you
</I>&gt;<i> were encountering with reactor.callWhenRunning, though.  How do you get
</I>&gt;<i> a reference to the bound method to pass in?  That's simple - don't call
</I>&gt;<i> the reactor method until you *have* an instance.  You can call almost any
</I>&gt;<i> reactor method even *after* the reactor is started; you do not have to set
</I>&gt;<i> everything up before you call reactor.run.
</I>
OK, so somewhere within my B class, maybe in initDone, set it up there? 
    That makes sense.

Thanks,
- Joe
