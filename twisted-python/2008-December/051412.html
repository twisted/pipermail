Just because you have a number of sources doesn't mean you
intrinsically can't use them in an efficient, event-oriented manner.
And you don't need a time-based call *just* because you have more than
one interface to the bot.

A timed poll may end up the easiest solution for you, but I want to
make sure you understand the way events work, because there may be a
much better solution. Let's go over your example event sources:

Time - Easy: your event source there is reactor.callLater itself.
Change in the temperature - How does your thermostat communicate this
information? A serial connection? a TCP socket? in any case, you can
probably hook up to that event source with Twisted directly.
Stock price - same question.

The point is that you can hook into these event sources with some code
that will immediately send the message out over your AIM (or IRC, or
whatever other) interface to the bot. That means communication will be
instantaneous *and* efficient.
