<PRE>I'm trying to make a simple AIM bot that, in addition to responding when 
I talk to it, can also send me a message on its own initiative.  My code 
is based on SkippyTalkBot [1], but I confess that I don't understand it 
very well, and though I've been crawling the Twisted documentation for a 
few days now, it's still rather mysterious to me.

So I'm at a loss as to how to add an &quot;idle&quot; function that will allow my 
bot to periodically see whether it has something new to say to the user. 
  My code looks like this:

class B(oscar.BOSConnection):
     capabilities = [oscar.CAP_CHAT]

...

     def receiveMessage(self, user, multiparts, flags):
	&quot;respond to an incoming message from the user&quot;
	# (by calling self.sendMessage)

...

class OA(oscar.OscarAuthenticator):
    BOSClass = B

protocol.ClientCreator(reactor, OA, SN, PASS, 
icq=icqMode).connectTCP(*hostport)
reactor.run()


Now, from trawling the docs, I guess that I want to call 
reactor.callWhenRunning... but then I'd like to pass in a bound method 
of my B class, so it can call sendMessage on myself.  But I'm stumped as 
to how my B class is even being instantiated, let alone how to get a 
reference to that instance.  And the callWhenRunning idea is only a wild 
guess and probably wrong.

I'm sure the answer is in the Twisted docs or examples somewhere, but I 
haven't been able to find it.  Will someone have pity and share a clue?

Thanks,
- Joe
