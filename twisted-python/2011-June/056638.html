<PRE>Hi Tom

&gt;<i> in a GUI application I'm using quite a comprehensive chain of deferreds
</I>&gt;<i> and I'm running the mainloop from the glib2reactor. At a certain point of
</I>&gt;<i> my application I need to terminate the entire chain of deferreds to make
</I>&gt;<i> sure that no more data is loaded and processed. Stopping the reactor does
</I>&gt;<i> not work as the entire GUI would terminate, too. I tried to cancel the
</I>&gt;<i> first deferred, hoping that the cancel event will be forwarded to the
</I>&gt;<i> next deferred in the chain or at least invoke an errback, but for some
</I>&gt;<i> reason it does not work and the deferreds seem to run forever. Any ideas
</I>&gt;<i> on how to solve this issue?
</I>
It's a bit hard to know how to help without more detail.  Code you paste
some code somewhere?  I'm sorry if this sounds picky, but your description
is a bit vague. E.g., there's no such thing as a &quot;chain of deferreds&quot; (do
you mean chain of callbacks on a single deferred? or a callbacks that
return deferreds etc?) and e.g., &quot;deferreds seem to run forever&quot; but
deferreds don't run at all, callbacks do. If you can make it a bit more
precise I'll be happy to try to help.

Terry
