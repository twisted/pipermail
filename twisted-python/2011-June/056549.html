<PRE>Hey Twisted Developers,
I'm looking to get a half dozen devs who will commit to being on the  
Twisted IRC channel next Wed and Thurs during biz hours to answer  
noobish queries from CS faculty working in an OS environment for the  
first time. One group will be working on Twisted bug tickets.  All  
the details are below.  If you are interested please LMK on the list,  
or you can email me directly at dshein at rochester.rr.com.

Greetings:
My name is Dave Shein, and I'm an Adjunct Faculty at Rochester  
Institute of Technology. Along with Chris Tyler of Seneca College, we  
are hosting a week long POSSE boot-camp at the RIT campus from June  
20th -24th. POSSE, sponsored by Red Hat, is a week long educational  
hand-on seminar in open source process, collaboration, and education.  
The central purpose of POSSE is to increase awareness and  
opportunities for Open Source participation in the university  
setting. All POSSE participants are university staff or faculty who  
will take what they learn in POSSE and use that knowledge in CS and  
related curricula, to spread the word about open source  
collaboration, and to provide increased educational opportunities for  
CS related students. Our first two days are spent acclimating our  
participants to tools and resources of the open source community, but  
on the third and fourth day of POSSE we will have our participants do  
a code-sprint. We are looking for opportunities in existing open  
source projects which have a quick learning curve and setup time for  
folks with a CS background but who in most cases will not have a  
great depth of experience working in open source languages. We are  
particularly interested in having our participants hack on Fedora  
based projects. The students will have a Fedora F14 &amp; F15/Linux work  
environment setup as part of their initial orientation, and we are  
looking for projects that will not have lengthy setup beyond the  
participants' initial setup.
We obtained information about your open source project through  
OpenHatch, and would like to know if your project would have elements  
that would be amenable to our sprint. There will be approximately  
fifteen to twenty participants working on the sprint in teams of 3 to  
5 people each, of whom most are coders. IN ADDITION we are also  
looking for a project participation opportunity for 3 to 4 non- 
coders, possibly in the form of testing, copywriting, or editing  
work. Ideally we would also like to coordinate with a point-person in  
your organization during the period of the sprint, a person to whom  
participants could direct questions, perhaps via IRC in real time.
If this is of interest to you please contact me at your earliest  
convenience. I hope that we can work together soon.
