Pretty much what everyone is insinuating is that:

a) By your description it is not obvious what the application is doing, so a better description will be more helpful
b) You are using incorrect terms, making even harder to give advice
c) Callback chains don't have any built-in support for any kind of cancelling/stopping.
d) Deferreds have a cancel method but it's up to the creator of the Deferred to provide any meaning to it

Now, if you have a loop loading data and passing it to a chain of callbacks, and you'd need to stop mid-processing, the way I'd do that is to have a 'isStopped' boolean variable that can be set to True to initiate the stopping procedure. You will then stop loading any data and finish processing existing data. However, this is little more than a guess based upon my very vague understanding of the problem you are trying to describe.
