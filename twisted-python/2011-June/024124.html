So our code sprint is now scheduled be on August 9th and 10th.   I will ping the list again as we get closer.  I want to say thank you to those who volunteered; I really appreciate your getting back to me.  Anyone who is considering helping, I want to say that even if there is not much accomplished during the sprint itself, here you have almost a score of faculty, many of whom will go on to teach open source and be faculty sponsors for student open source projects.  Having these faculty work on Twisted is a very good way to help increase awareness of your project/work amongst new people coming into the OS community.

Sorry to hear about the delay, and good luck to your parter's family.

The delay is an opportunity for more people to volunteer though.  Perhaps we should post this to the Twisted Matrix Labs blog?
