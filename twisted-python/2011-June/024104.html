The ticket I can find quickly is &lt;<A HREF="http://tm.tl/4977">http://tm.tl/4977</A>&gt;.  Worth noting is that this ticket doesn't propose any major changes to the interface, except that it won't be a type, so you won't be able to do isinstance(x, DeferredList) any more.  But you shouldn't be doing this now, because nothing really needs to subclass Deferred.

So, when that replacement does arrive, as it stands now, changing one import line should be all you need to do to update your code.

If somebody wants to propose some changes in the new and improved version, commenting on that ticket would be a good place to start. :)
