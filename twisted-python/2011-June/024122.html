<PRE>Hi Glyph &amp; Jean-Paul &amp; Whomever else volunteered,

My partner for POSSE had a family health emergency on Friday, so we  
have had to postpone the boot-camp.  We will be doing POSSE RIT in  
the second week of August.  So our code sprint is now scheduled be on  
August 9th and 10th.   I will ping the list again as we get closer.   
I want to say thank you to those who volunteered; I really appreciate  
your getting back to me.  Anyone who is considering helping, I want  
to say that even if there is not much accomplished during the sprint  
itself, here you have almost a score of faculty, many of whom will go  
on to teach open source and be faculty sponsors for student open  
source projects.  Having these faculty work on Twisted is a very good  
way to help increase awareness of your project/work amongst new  
people coming into the OS community.

Sincerely,

Dave Shein
Rochester Institute of Technology
