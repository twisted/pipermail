Yeah, those were known bugs. I didn't wait for the buildbot to go
green before putting out these alphas.

&gt;<i> - The split FAQ led me to believe there would be one Twisted package as
</I>&gt;<i> before; which would contain everything as before.  Core would be in a
</I>&gt;<i> TwistedCore package.  The tarballs on your site seem to have Core in the
</I>&gt;<i> Twisted tarball.  Is that intentional ?
</I>
Yeah. &quot;Twisted Core&quot; is just used to disambiguate it from the other
subprojects of Twisted. AIUI, &quot;Twisted&quot; is officially the networking
framework. The tarball that contains everything will just be a
convenience, and it will be called something like TwistedSumo.tar.bz2.
I encourage packagers to name the twisted core package &quot;twisted&quot; and
twisted subproject packages &quot;twisted-foo&quot;. A &quot;sumo&quot; package is
unnecessary on all non-barbaric packaging systems; I only think it's
appropriate in tarball and win32 form.

&gt;<i> - I wonder why the naming of tarballs is the way it is.  For example,
</I>&gt;<i> the URL will be .../twisted/web, the import package is twisted.web, why
</I>&gt;<i> is the tarball TwistedWeb-(version).tar.bz2 ?
</I>
I don't understand your question. The tarball contains the word
&quot;twisted&quot; and &quot;web&quot;, and so do your examples of the words it is
derived from. What is wrong with the way it is named?

&gt;<i> - As a general request on behalf of packagers, it's nice to not have
</I>&gt;<i> anything but digits in version numbers.  I know this is probably a
</I>&gt;<i> contented point of view.
</I>
*shrug* none of the past RPM or deb packagers have ever asked me to
change it, and they have successfully made packages.

&gt;<i> I'll report some more when I managed to package it up (or wrest RPM's
</I>&gt;<i> from Jeff's hands) and have been able to use them against some of our
</I>&gt;<i> tests.
</I>
Thanks!
