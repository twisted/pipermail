[snip everything for brevity]

Thanks for sharing this Stephen. It's made me question the realm-portal
architecture I've been using.

I notice that Stephen creates multiple realms - one for each &quot;service&quot;
your application provides. Each realm then has a portal to connect it to
the checker(s).

That is interesting because the approach I have taken is to have *one*
realm for the entire application and a portal for each &quot;service&quot;. For
instance I might have a single instance of my.app.Realm and one each of
my.web.public.Portal, my.web.admin.Portal, my.web.xmlrpc.Portal,
my.ftp.Portal etc.

The reason I structure my code like this is because I consider the realm
to be the &quot;hub&quot; of the application (something I thought the cred HOWTO
was hinting at). My realm generally has all sorts of useful attributes,
i.e. a ConnectionPool, as well as the application's &quot;global&quot; API. I also
anticipated that, one day, my realm instance would need to be more aware
of the avatars it had created.

Right now, the only issue I have with my singleton realm way of working
is that the realm's requestAvatar can get big and tends to look like a
switch statement. It has to know about everything going on, even if it
doesn't much care about the avatar once the method returns. Stephen's
approach, by comparison, seems a little simpler in this respect in that
each realm is there to create an particular type of &quot;service&quot; avatar.

I still think that one realm and multiple portals is a better model but
does anyone anyone else have opinions, suggestions, hints etc.

Thanks, Matt
