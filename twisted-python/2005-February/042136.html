Won't the data be freed along with the protocol when the connection is
closed? The protocol should go away when the connection is closed.

&gt;<i> just if your peer happens to be sending data very rapidly.
</I>
The high bound of in flight receive data for each int32 protocol is set
to 99999 (protocol.MAX_LENGTH), and the reactor will read with a limited
buffer too. So I don't see any problem as long as
transport.pauseProducing() does what's expected to do (i.e. to stop
polling the socket and to stop receiving data from the wire).

Anyway if there's still a problem, let's ignore my problem, and let's
only focus on the LineReceiver implementation that is already in current
twisted. As long as LineReceiver works my patch is going to be fine.

There was a reentrancy bug in LineReceiver but I already fixed it.
