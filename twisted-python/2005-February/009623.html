I didn't know about this linereceiver feature, very nice. I'm using
int32stringreceiver which misses it like netstringreceiver (I was
definitely sure something was missing in twisted after reading all the
code of int32stringreceiver), so I'll try to implement it following the
linereceiver example.

Many thanks to get me on the right track!
