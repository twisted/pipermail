I don't really understand how this is any easier with PB than with
AMP, though. With AMP, you &quot;just&quot; need the same command definitions on
both sides. With PB, you need the exact same Python code versions for
every class you are sending over the wire; if achieving this is not a
problem, then why is it problematic to get the same AMP command
definitions on both sides?

</I>
You don't quite have to do a TCP handshake for every request you want
to send over an HTTP channel, but there are still some problems.
Connection keep-alive means you can send another request after you
have received a response, without reconnecting; pipelining means you
can send another request right away, but you still won't get the
response until after you receive the first response. In addition,
there are various error handling situations where you are basically
forced to close the connection and open a new one. By contrast, an AMP
connection can have any number of AMP request/response exchanges in
flight at one time, in either direction; the closest thing to this in
HTTP-land is SPDY's connection multiplexing, but that's still
asymmetric (client makes requests to the server, server cannot make
requests to the client, so you need to do some kind of long polling /
inversion of control to simulate this).
