<PRE>Ah, I never tried abortConnection, but I'm doing something similar - I just
call loseConnection() and that does the trick.  And yes, I believe that the
TCP connection does stay alive because I was watching closeSocket() and it
was never called.

I wish I could be more helpful with regard to code samples to reproduce
this - but right now my stuff is a mess.

We're using the wokkel library, calling stopService() when we want
everything to be cleaned up.  They override that function, but I believe
they're doing everything correctly.  Basically, they're just calling
connection.disconnect() - and eventually the shutdownTLS() gets invoked.

Maybe most people just never care about having to clean up their
connections during a single session?  As for a fix - maybe it's not
necessary to do the test for
if shutdownSuccess in _shutdownTLS() ?

According to the ssl spec, it's not absolutely necessary to wait for the
server to return the close handshake.

That being said, that seems lousy - and it really seems like something else
must be going on.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi, I'm having an issue where a tls connection never seems to shutdown
</I>&gt;<i> properly, and as a result, all the associated cleanup never happens.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Basically we're trying to implement a jabber client and allow the user
</I>&gt;<i> to sign out and then re-sign back in without completely quitting the
</I>&gt;<i> program.  When the user tries to sign back in, Twisted goes nuts because
</I>&gt;<i> the original connection was never shutdown properly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, I traced through the code with the debugger and I came to the
</I>&gt;<i> _shutdownTLS() function in tls.py.  I believe that what's supposed to
</I>&gt;<i> happen is that the first time through, the self._tlsConnection.shutdown()
</I>&gt;<i> returns False because the shutdown is initiated.  Then, when the 2nd part
</I>&gt;<i> of the shutdown handshake comes back from the server, dataReceived is
</I>&gt;<i> called, which calls shutdownTLS again, and then the cleanup can continue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is that after the initial call to shutdownTLS, I never see
</I>&gt;<i> anymore data from the server.  I'm not sure if it's a server issue (we're
</I>&gt;<i> just connecting to the Google jabber servers) where they don't close down
</I>&gt;<i> their SSL connections correctly, or if I'm just doing something silly.  So
</I>&gt;<i> anyway, I could solve this by overriding a bunch of stuff and ensuring that
</I>&gt;<i> self.transport.loseConnection() gets called no matter what, even when the
</I>&gt;<i> server doesn't respond with the second part of the close handshake, but I
</I>&gt;<i> figured I'd ask here first.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, any TLS experts out there?  Thanks for any help or information - I
</I>&gt;<i> really appreciate it,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sadly I don't know enough about TLS specifics to tell you for sure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds like you may have spotted a bug.  More investigation is required
</I>&gt;<i> though.  Does .abortConnection() do what you expect?  In your current
</I>&gt;<i> problematic scenario, does the TCP connection to your peer stay alive?
