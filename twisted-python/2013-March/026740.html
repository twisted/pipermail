I understand this and I am not requesting to move the code to GitHub.
I don't think that this is a god idea.

I was only asking about GitHub mirrors.
The main request for this thread was to have a single source repo
mirror for Twisted in GitHub.
Now there are at least 2.

Now there are also 2 unrelated branches in GitHub for the same
twisted, my original branch and Tom's mirror.

&gt;&gt;<i> I understand that moving from SVN to GIT is not easy and if core
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers can create and share SVN branches there is no big
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inconvenience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if there is a desire to move to git. In any case, before
</I>&gt;<i> any such migration can occur. Namely, updating all the hooks and tools
</I>&gt;<i> to work with whatever vcs is being switched to. My impression is that,
</I>&gt;<i> at least at one point, bzr was a more likely choice of distributed vcs
</I>&gt;<i> to switch to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I am not requesting to move to Git.

I was just expressing my frustration that attaching patch files to
Trac is not fun, and working with read-only SVN is not fun, and
following out-of-line review comments is not fun.
