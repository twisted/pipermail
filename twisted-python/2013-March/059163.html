I agree that this is a ugly hack and I removed the project.

Sorry for the late reply.

I am still clumsy when working with Twisted so I don't know if I can
help to much here.

I don't know what is expected from a restartable reactor.

The way I am testing deferreds is by starting the reactor, allow for
the deferred to execute and then stop the reactor.

I don't want to pause it and then continue the execution from where it
was stopped.

To help with debugging I am also printing a snapshot of reactor state
at a certain time.

----

I prefer the Arrange/Act/Assert way of writing test:


checker = mk.credentialsChecker()
credentials = mk.credentials()

deferred = checker.requestAvatarId(credentials)
failure = self.getDeferredFailure(deferred)

self.assertFailureType(AuthentiationError, failure)
self.assertEqual(credentials.username, failure.value.username)


I found it easier to read than this version:


checker = mk.credentialsChecker()
credentials = mk.credentials()

    def check_result(result_or_failure):
        self.assertFailureType(AuthentiationError, failure)
        self.assertEqual(credentials.username, failure.value.username)

deferred = checker.requestAvatarId(credentials)
deferred.addBoth(check_result)

return deferred

--------

I have updated the code to use as many public reactor members as possible.

The following private member are still use:
reactor._startedBefore, reactor._started

It uses the following public methods:
startRunning(), doIteration(), stop(), iterate()

Here is the main part that blocks the execution until the deferred got a result.
It executes the deferred in the reactor loop.

------

Maybe this is has only limited usage, but I just wanted to share this work.
For me, this makes writing test a much nicer experience.

Cheers,
