There are two reasons that someone might want to consider AMP in this case.  I am not necessarily saying you would want to consider AMP here - you seem to be pretty happy with your decision and I'm not saying it's wrong.  I even gave some reasons why PB would be a better idea sometimes.

One is that it makes it a bit easier to replace one end of the wire with something that isn't Twisted - or at least, preserve the plausible deniability that you might, which can make it more politically palatable to deploy Twisted in the first place :).  Granted, &quot;use PyPy&quot; is increasingly a better argument for the sorts of people who would want this assurance - performance nuts - than &quot;you could re-implement in another language later&quot;.  Still, if there are other reasons, or you are in an environment where another language is popular, while PB implementations for other languages do exist, and I have deployed polyglot PB clusters, it adds a surprising dimension of additional complexity.  Deploying a polyglot AMP system is a breeze, even if you have to implement AMP from scratch for the other language in order to do it ;).

Another reason is that it makes versioning the protocol easier.  With PB, it's very easy to build a protocol that mirrors your application's internal state, and expose implementation details accidentally, which then have to be painstakingly emulated when you roll out a new version.  This isn't much of a concern if your protocol is pretty stable, and/or your application upgrades are synchronized.

Like you said though: writing up all those message format declarations is not zero-cost.  It's certainly much quicker to get a basic PB cluster up and running since you can just toss a couple of remote_ declarations in and be off to the races.

There is a good reason Twisted still ships both and we have no plans to ever get rid of PB :).

&gt;<i>  2. Communicating with a semi-trusted third party process, for which a 
</I>&gt;<i> RESTful interface or XML/JSON RPCs are *available* and sufficiently 
</I>&gt;<i> secure and capable for my needs.
</I>
For this one, obviously, XML or JSON-RPC is the right choice.  I mean, heck, 90% of Twisted is implementations of messy, arguably bad protocols (IMAP?  POP?  **FTP?**) which you probably shouldn't use, except you have to because you want to talk to a system that uses them :).

&gt;<i> Obviously other people will have radically different needs, but for me, 
</I>&gt;<i> AMP adds little.
</I>
Sure.  It might not be for everybody.
