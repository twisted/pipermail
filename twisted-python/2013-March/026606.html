Being able to &quot;early drop&quot; bad PDUs is a fine notion, but it's not a 
property that comes with zero cost. If you feel that the cost/benefit 
tradeoff is not useful in your case (and I do) then it doesn't make 
sense to pay it.

AMP would be somewhat more attractive (to me) if it were possible to run 
with the IDL just on the &quot;server&quot; (i.e. callee); this would achieve the 
goal of protocol-level sanity checking, without the cost of having to 
distribute the IDL to the clients. Presumably it would be possible to 
implement this now - have an AMP discovery command that dynamically 
builds the client-side IDLs. But there's no incentive for me to do that.

For the use-cases I have, the protocol version/interop problem is not 
relevant.

You don't need to do a TCP handshake for every request in any of those 
protocols either. Long-lived TCP/HTTP sessions are quite common, though 
not universal.

It will be interesting to see if and how HTTP/2.0 solves a lot of these 
issues.

&gt;<i> can receive responses out of order, and you can receive a request while
</I>&gt;<i> waiting for a response, and so on.
</I>
Obviously. But I would tend to use those protocols when either those 
properties are not needed (perhaps even undesireable) and may be 
impossible to make use of (if the far end is a synchronous, blocking 
client unable to make use of out-of-order responses or server-initiated 
messages).

In those cases, it would also be rare for AMP to be available, and it 
certainly wouldn't be pre-installed.

&quot;Install this Java library on your Oracle servers then...&quot;
&quot;Ha ha no go away.&quot;

You seemed curious why someone wouldn't use AMP. Personally I have two 
common use-cases:

  1. Communicating between two trusted Twisted processes, for which PB 
is good enough.

  2. Communicating with a semi-trusted third party process, for which a 
RESTful interface or XML/JSON RPCs are *available* and sufficiently 
secure and capable for my needs.

Obviously other people will have radically different needs, but for me, 
AMP adds little.

Cheers,
Phil
