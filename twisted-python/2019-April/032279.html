</I>&gt;<i> Hi Jean-Paul,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No I dont want it to be mixed with stdout stream, it should be separated from normal stdout, so that I know it is an error.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To be honest, I am pretty to new to Twisted concept, there are things that I have not familiar with yet. Actually I can also implement a low level ssh client (which I already did), but as SSHCommandClientEndpoint is already available, so I want to use it straight away. But when I dived in the source code, the _CommandChannel only implements dataReceived but not extReceived.
</I>
The main point of `SSHCommandClientEndpoint` is to allow code that doesn't know about SSH to run over SSH, for example to enable forwarding.  So you can't unconditionally require everyone to implement extReceived, because IProtocol doesn't require this.

&gt;<i> For your suggestion on using ProcessEndpoint how can I use it for my SSH client?
</I>
Jean-Paul was suggesting a way that Twisted could be modified to support your use-case, not a thing that you can do today in your own code.

&gt;<i> In my extReceived I just deliver what I got to the extReceived of method protocol, it is exactly the same as Twisted implements dataReceived:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> class CommandChannel(_CommandChannel): 
</I>&gt;<i>     def extReceived(self, dataType, data):
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>         When the command's extended data (usually standard error) arrives,
</I>&gt;<i>         deliver it to the protocol instance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         @type dataType: L{int}
</I>&gt;<i>         @type data:     L{str}
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;&quot;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>         self._protocol.extReceived(dataType, data)
</I>
If you wanted to contribute this functionality to Twisted, the usual idiom here would be to do a check, like:

protocol = self._protocol
if ISSHExtendedProtocol.providedBy(protocol):
    protocol.extReceived(dataType, data)

Doing this on every extReceived may be a little bit of a performance hit, so caching this computation and/or the behavior associated with it is left as an exercise for you :).

&gt;<i> I have two other questions since you are here
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) how can we execute command like more or less which is an interactive command?
</I>
Looking at what the 'conch' script does, I think what you're asking is something like this:

self.conn.sendRequest(self, b'exec', common.NS(options['command']))

&gt;<i> 2) how to request a pty to ssh server?
</I>
Again from twisted/conch/scripts/conch.py:

ptyReqData = session.packRequest_pty_req(term, winSize, '')
self.conn.sendRequest(self, b'pty-req', ptyReqData)


&gt;<i>

Thanks for using Twisted,
