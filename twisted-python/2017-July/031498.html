Does anyone else think this would be a good idea?

Isn't this exactly what you want Glyph? (maybe I missed sth :-D)

It could affect the workflow of people with write-access though.

&gt;<i> If those are GitHub labels and only modifiable by repo owners, it sounds
</I>&gt;<i> like a sane thing to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One thing that would worry me though, is that more commits could come to
</I>&gt;<i> that PR after the reviewer (repo owner) sets the 'OK to merge' tag, I
</I>&gt;<i> guess such a tag should be associated with the last commit but I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> too sure that's possible out of the box with GitHub.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I know that there are ways that bots can facilitate this, and if someone else would like to set that up, that would be great.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe a bot could figure out the last reviewed commit and remove the
</I>&gt;<i> label if it detects new (not reviewed) commits in that PR.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I... would actually be interested in taking a look at it, got any
</I>&gt;<i> pointers / are there already some bots for the twisted project running?
