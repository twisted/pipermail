If that's all you want, Twisted is the least of your worries:

  - MTBF on your hard drive is almost certainly less than 10 years.
  - libc won't continue to be compatible with your current build of Python for 10 years.
  - It's unlikely that the 10-years-hence version of Python will even _parse_ your code, let alone run it.  (Discussion of Python 3k has started in earnest recently... the timeframe looks to be less than a decade.)
  - the 10-years-hence version of Linux will probably not work with current builds of Python or libc.
  - it is unlikely that the x86 processor architecture will still be en vogue in 10 years, which leads to another set of problems.

A custom-coded project that expects to run with no maintenance programming staff - but to also receive up-to-the-minute security updates! - is unlikely to succeed.  I am not aware of any such project.

I can sympathize with your desire for a perpetually-supported platform; I had a similar crisis working on a project about 5 years ago which I just wanted to &quot;write and forget&quot;, but the fact is that writing a platform which can weather a decade's changing hardware and software fads is an **immensely** difficult problem, one nobody has really solved yet.

</I>
Your requirement for a telnet server is that it will be maintained with a stable interface indefinitely, so that libraries can be upgraded for security fixes forever.  However, you can't update your application code to any minor changes in the telnet server interface, because you're not going to be maintaining the application code at all.  Therefore, rather than packaging a copy of the telnet server for stability (because this wouldn't be updated) you are going to write your own (which you won't update, because you aren't planning to maintain the code, only the installation)?
