This is a limitation of SVN, not Combinator. There's no way to write
branches to the server without having write access to the server.

Actually, it would be better to have the branch up there in the repo, so
&gt;<i> that the ongoing work is visible. Is there a way to get write access to
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> branches and sandbox trees of the Twisted repo, without having it in the
</I>&gt;<i> tags and trunk trees?
</I>


We don't have an actual policy yet on what it takes to get write access
restricted to sandbox, and branches. We have given access to people on the
agreement that they only keep their stuff in /branches or /sandbox for a
while and someone has to review before merging, but this is exactly the
process we've switched to for everyone now, anyway. It'd still be nice to
get some access restrictions in place, though.

But really, the suggested workflow for offline Twisted hacking is this: Hack
on your checkout of trunk, do a &quot;svn diff &gt; my_patch&quot;, file a bug on the
tracker, and attach the patch. Do this successfully a few times, and real
commit access is imminent.
