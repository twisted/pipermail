<PRE>Hello,

I tried to implement that timeout method. I think I did it corrrectly (example 
attached in this mail), but it seems that one can't disconnect() a PB if it 
hasn't replied yet :-( It looks like it is locked and waits for an answer 
from the remote PB.
So if you run a netcat (nc -vv -l -p 9003) and run my code, timeoutHandler()
is called but the factory is NOT disconnected :-(

Did you do something different from my code?

Thanks for your help,
Luc
