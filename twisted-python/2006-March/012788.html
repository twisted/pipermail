Is it the case that this should be the default process for everyone and
that something special needs to be done for merging? Andrew might have
already mentioned, but I know that for his project you need to tag
things in your commit message as &quot;r=[reviewer's IRC name]&quot; (or
[trivial]) and that the merging software actually checks this.

We could do something similar, or possibly even stricter where most
&quot;Twisted committers&quot; do not in fact actually have merge capability, only
reviewers do. It depends whether our reviewers are going to be pretty
much all of us who already have access, or some trusted subset.
