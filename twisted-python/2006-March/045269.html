&quot;c&quot; PB, by which you're probably referrering to cBanana, is still around, I
think. It replaces a small portion of the serialization process with a C
extension. I have no idea how much this might help. The architecture of
existing twisted.spread PB is not ideally suited towards replacing large
parts of it with C extensions, so there is probably a limit as to how much it
could be sped up this way.

&quot;newpb&quot;, which is the next-generation PB that lives in twisted.pb (in SVN),
does not yet have any C extensions to speed it up, but I've tried to design
it in such a way that it will be easier to write them, and to make it
possible to replace more of the protocol implementation with C extensions
than in oldpb. This will need to interact with the creactor/cppreactor code
that Itamar has in his sandbox. But my hope is that newpb will be relatively
straightforward to make really fast.


I've just now created a trac/wiki page for newpb, with a brief list of
features and some pointers to docs.. please take a look!
