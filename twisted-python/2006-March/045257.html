<PRE>
Right now, there are no exceptions to the rule of &quot;make sure there's a ticket before you check any code in to trunk&quot;.

However, several people raised some concerns on IRC over the additional friction this adds for minor fixes (the change in question being spiv's doc correction of &quot;the the&quot;).

It's worth noting that if branching is difficult for you, it is also perfectly acceptable to attach a patch to a ticket.  The important thing is that a ticket exist first, so that merging and reviewing can be done independently of committing, not that a branch actually be created in SVN.

For now, because defining &quot;trivial&quot; is so hard (what if your docstring fix has a typo which actually changes some code which breaks some tests?), and it is always too tempting to classify &quot;just this one&quot; branch as &quot;trivial&quot; because the author wants to merge it really fast and it's not _too_ long, the proposed solution is to have a shared &quot;minor fixes&quot; ticket and branch, which should be reviewed once a week or so, and merged en-masse.

To be clear: there are still *no exceptions* to this rule.  However, please feel free to file a general-purpose ticket for minor fixes and work with as many other developers checking into the branch for that ticket.
