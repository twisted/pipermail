<PRE>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> One way to fix this is to manually construct a ViewPoint rather than a Viewable and pass that to the client.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If someone would be willing to supply a very simple demonstration of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this I would appreciate it very much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a very simple change to your server; your client remains the same.  Just construct a
</I>&gt;<i> ViewPoint with the user as perspective around your viewable.
</I>
I just looked at the viewpoint api docs. I believe I understand. Thank you.

&gt;&gt;<i> I am willing to help but as of right now I only know how to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perspective broker; I do not know how it works under the hood.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it's open source, so the hood opens right up, go ahead and pop it :-).
</I>
Indeed I will do so. I just meant to indicate that as I have no prior
experience with the source I cannot promise any sort of timeliness for
a fix.

&gt;&gt;<i> I have been collecting notes on bugs in the perspective broker
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documentation. I promise to submit a documentation patch when I have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first draft of my project up and running.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please feel free to submit _many_ bugs, if there are many issues :-).
</I>
There are indeed many issues, however they are inter-related. As I
said, I will try to make some sense out of what needs to be fixed and
file (and fix!) tickets in as orderly a fashion as I can.
