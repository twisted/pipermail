Since the RPython/PyPy toolchain currently has better support for generating
standalone executables than for doing much else, I'd suggest taking that
approach.  Compile your RPython to a standalone executable, run it from a
Twisted-based process and do some simple RPC over stdio.  It's a bit heavy
handed, but I think it's the most straightforward approach given the state
of RPython.  The PyPy developers can probably give you better ideas about
what long-term direction might be best, though.  There's probably nothing
special about using RPython with Twisted - from the RPython perspective,
Twisted is just another pile of Python code that you need to figure out an
integration strategy for.  Whatever the generally correct approach is is
probably the approach that makes sense for using Twisted.
