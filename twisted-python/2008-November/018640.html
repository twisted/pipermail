<PRE>David, thanks for your response, it's great when people take the time
to read a lengthy question and then respond with some insight!

I ended up sort of answering this one for myself by just playing with
a basic chat server example and sniffing packets - only saw
SYN,SYN-ACK,ACK once for each client. Though it would be nice if the
documentation gave this level of detail, presumably this is something
that belongs with the different transports.

Duh, good point! Guess I was kinda trying to map our requirements onto
an example that looked easy (from the book).

&gt;<i> If not for the Java requirement, I would say that Twisted is a good fit,

</I>
Guess I'll have to take a closer look at the Java implementation. Not
sure why I didn't stumble across AMP before but looks promising...

Thanks,
