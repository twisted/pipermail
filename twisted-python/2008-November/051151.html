I can probably guess why you didn't stumble across AMP, because it  
took me a long time to discover it as well. The problem is that ti  
isn't really discussed anywhere in the Twisted documentation (other  
than in the API description). It is, I think, one of the better kept  
secrets in the Twisted arsenal. The only exception is on this list,  
where it comes up frequently as the solution to a lot of problems  
(though without much detail). I wonder if there wouldn't be some  
benefit to adding a section in the core documentation near the section  
on the PB... I would write some myself, but I didn't find AMP in time  
and wrote the apps I currently work with using PB or custom protocols  
and I just haven't had the time to learn AMP and work with it...
