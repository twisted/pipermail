I was thinking of operator overloading and multiple inheritance,
actually. The rationale for not including them in the language was
that they are often abused. {{fact}}

+1

&gt;<i> On the other hand, it's equally frustrating to use a library where the

Yes. This is a documentation (or perhaps a navigation) problem. I
simply wanted to make the point that I find &quot;don't provide X because
people might abuse it&quot; unconvincing. I don't even think you were
making that point, but I really really want to be clear that it's not
a good one.

Also, if you haven't read it, you might enjoy Rusty's interface guide:
