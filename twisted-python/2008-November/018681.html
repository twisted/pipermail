<PRE>Ampoule is a process pool implementation written on top of Twisted
Matrix. Its name comes from the use of AMP as the default
communication protocol between the pool and all its children.

It's different from other alternative solutions because it provides an
API very close to that of the Twisted ThreadPool. As an helper
function it also provides a deferToAMPProcess function that creates
the ProcessPool and submits jobs to it.

There has been 2 released since the last announce so I'm going
to report both of them here.

Ampoule 0.0.5 (2008-11-12)
==========================

Changes
--------
  - Fixed bug #259264, this fix introduces a number of changes in the
    architecture of the project:
     1. Removed childReactor argument form the process pool and added
        a starter argument.
     2. Introduced the concept of a starter object whose role is to
        start subprocesses with given parameters. This makes it easier
        to specify particular parameters (eg. new env variables) to the
        child processes without needing to override many methods in the
        pool using closures.
     3. main.py is completely changed and now provides the  
ProcessStarter
        object which is a default implementation of IStarter.
     4. IStarter interface currently documents only 2 methods:
             startAMPProcess
             startPythonProcess
         in the future it's possible that we will add an additional:
             startProcess
         that starts whichever process we want without requiring python,
         also this might end up with the separation of ProcessPool in at
         least 2 logical levels: the ProcessPool and a dispatcher that
         talks with the children, in this way it would be possible to
         create custom ProcessPools without changing much code or  
requiring
         any special requirement on the children.

  - Introduced a callRemote method on the ProcessPool that is basically
    the same as doWork. Introduced for symmetry between all the RPC  
libraries
    in Twisted.

  - reactor short name and ampoule child class are now passed as the 2
    last arguments rather than the first 2. So if you have written any
    custom bootstrap code be sure to change sys.argv[1] and sys.argv[2]
    into sys.argv[-2] and sys.argv[-1] respectively.

Ampoule 0.0.4 (2008-11-03)
==========================

Changes
--------
  - Ampoule parent process and child processes now talk using FDs 3 (in)
    and 4 (out) in order to avoid problems with libraries that  
mistakenly
    send error lines to stdout (yes, I'm looking at you gtk+)
