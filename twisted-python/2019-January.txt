Subject: [Twisted-Python] Negative error code breaks twisted.conch
Message-ID: <1547479408.2459764.1634165776.62199E68@webmail.messagingengine.com>

An SSCCE:

from twisted.internet import error
from twisted.python import failure
from twisted.conch.ssh.session import SSHSessionProcessProtocol
from mock import MagicMock

err = error.ProcessTerminated(-1)
fail = failure.Failure(err)
session = MagicMock()
proto = SSHSessionProcessProtocol(session)
proto.processEnded(fail)


That fails with:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ".../negexit.py", line 10, in <module>
    proto.processEnded(fail)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-
  packages/twisted/conch/ssh/session.py", line 279, in processEnded    struct.pack('>L', err.exitCode))
struct.error: integer out of range for 'L' format code

I'm running an SSH server on Windows, where negative exit codes
can happen.
Passing negative numbers to a ">L" format was allowed in Python before
2.6, where the number was treated as an unsigned int of the same bit
pattern. It was deprecated in 2.6, and became an error in 2.7. It's only
just become a problem for me because I'm updating a 10 year old SSH
server that has been running under 2.4 all this time.
Presumably the fix is to bit-mask the exitCode? I was able to work
around the error by doing that in a copy of _dumbwin32proc.py which was
copied into the project (historical reasons, don't ask) but it would be
nice to have a proper upstream fix. Not least because I want to purge
the copied-in file, as you can imagine.

This is a great bug!  Thanks for raising it.  Sounds like the fix is to simply reinterpret it as unsigned.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status#Windows: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status#Windows:>

>>> Windows uses 32-bit unsigned integers as exit codes,[11] although the command interpreter treats them as signed.[12] If a process fails initialization, a Windows system error code may be returned.[13][14]

Please do submit this fix upstream (file a ticket on Trac, open a PR, etc), it seems like one of the easier ones to integrate :-).

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

I'm happy to announce txtorcon 19.0.0, containing the following
changes:

 * add TorControlProtocol.when_disconnected (will replace .on_disconnect)
 * add detach= kwarg to Tor.create_onion_service
 * add purpose= kwarg to TorState.build_circuit

You can download the release from PyPI or GitHub (or of
course "pip install txtorcon"):

   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txtorcon/19.0.0
   https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon/releases/tag/v19.0.0

Releases are also available from the hidden service:

   http://timaq4ygg2iegci7.onion/txtorcon-19.0.0.tar.gz.asc

Or via a "version 3" service:

You can verify the sha256sum of both by running the following 4 lines
in a shell wherever you have the files downloaded:

cat <<EOF | sha256sum --check

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Requesting review on a workshop proposal
Message-ID: <20190128163642.GA8043@castor>

Respected Member,

I hope you are doing well. Recently I was employed to write a wrapper
over GNU/Linux device driver using Twisted. Throughout that task, I
explored and learned most of the Twisted. I am thinking to propose a
workshop at Python user group of my town. I am seeking help to review my
proposal. You can find proposal links at the end of this mail. Please
write back if you are finding any scope of improvements in it. English
is not my native language. If you are finding any grammatical mistakes
then too please share them with me. Have a great day!

Proposal links:

Message-ID: <861s5d41u6.fsf@atlantis.meejah.ca>


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

I'm happy to announce txtorcon 19.0.0, containing the following
changes:

 * add TorControlProtocol.when_disconnected (will replace .on_disconnect)
 * add detach= kwarg to Tor.create_onion_service
 * add purpose= kwarg to TorState.build_circuit

You can download the release from PyPI or GitHub (or of
course "pip install txtorcon"):

   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txtorcon/19.0.0
   https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon/releases/tag/v19.0.0

Releases are also available from the hidden service:

   http://timaq4ygg2iegci7.onion/txtorcon-19.0.0.tar.gz
   http://timaq4ygg2iegci7.onion/txtorcon-19.0.0.tar.gz.asc

Or via a "version 3" service:

   http://fjblvrw2jrxnhtg67qpbzi45r7ofojaoo3orzykesly2j3c2m3htapid.onion/txtorcon-19.0.0.tar.gz
   http://fjblvrw2jrxnhtg67qpbzi45r7ofojaoo3orzykesly2j3c2m3htapid.onion/txtorcon-19.0.0.tar.gz.asc

You can verify the sha256sum of both by running the following 4 lines
in a shell wherever you have the files downloaded:

cat <<EOF | sha256sum --check
3731b740653e3f551412744f1fcd7fa6f04aa9fa37c90dc6c9152e619886bf3b  txtorcon-19.0.0.tar.gz
196b7b5726e3c69a602071295368da9205c0cd1e26aba37536d3b8fb3b08ac9d  txtorcon-19.0.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
EOF

thanks,
meejah

(Sorry for the spam, all.  We try pretty hard to avoid twistedmatrix.com <http://twistedmatrix.com/> lists getting abused like this, but this address is for a legit member of the list, and this was a forgery; given that it made it past the spam filter, it's one that it is beyond my meager administrative resources to automatically reject.  If you're interested in email administration to help prevent this sort of stuff in the future please feel free to get in touch with me off-list.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Requesting review on a workshop proposal
Message-ID: <20190128163642.GA8043@castor>

Respected Member,

I hope you are doing well. Recently I was employed to write a wrapper
over GNU/Linux device driver using Twisted. Throughout that task, I
explored and learned most of the Twisted. I am thinking to propose a
workshop at Python user group of my town. I am seeking help to review my
proposal. You can find proposal links at the end of this mail. Please
write back if you are finding any scope of improvements in it. English
is not my native language. If you are finding any grammatical mistakes
then too please share them with me. Have a great day!

Proposal links:
