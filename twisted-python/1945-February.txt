Subject: [Twisted-Python] Creating an SSH client programatically with Twisted?
Message-ID: <200210211856.g9LIulJ67077@cgi-works.com>

Hi,

    I have been searching for a library to let me do SSH in python ...
    and came across Twisted ... I also found pyssh, but it doesn't
    support SSH sessions, just single command execution.

    I have looked at the documentation, the twisted.conch.ssh.* classes,
    and the test_conch.py script and am still having a hard time figuring
    out how to construct an SSH client using Twisted.

    Does anyone have pointers to examples or documentation that will help
    me do this?

    Thank you very much in advance for any help you can offer .. and thanks
    to the developers for creating an all-python SSH implementation!

Max

Hi,

    Thank you for the information and help.  Paul Swartz sent me an SSH
    client he has written and mentioned that he might be doing some more
    client examples and documentation for the conch module at some point.
