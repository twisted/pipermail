DeferredList is intended for the case where you want to wait for all
results to have arrived. Given its API, you basically *have* to create
all the millions of input Deferreds first (although not the tasks
themselves, if you're clever). So this is going to be slow, and use a
lot of memory... although 5 gigs is rather surprising, unless each task
has a lot of state.

&gt;<i>       * Is there a Twisted pattern for managing tasks efficiently that

</I>
It seems like you've figured it out, if you've written a custom task
runner. Probably Twisted should include some better abstraction for
doing this sort of thing, since it does come up regularly.
