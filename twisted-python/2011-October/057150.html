<PRE>&gt;<i> To me, 3.x support in trunk is not really workable unless you drop
</I>&gt;<i> pre-2.6 compatibility. Bytes literals are pretty much required.
</I>&gt;<i> A possible workaround is to call a factory function that makes
</I>&gt;<i> an str into a bytes in 3.x (e.g. write B(&quot;xyz&quot;) everywhere instead of
</I>&gt;<i> b&quot;xyz&quot;), but that's quite ugly IMO, not to mention suboptimal.
</I>
We're getting closer; we're going to drop Python 2.4 as soon as the next
release is out. Still not up to 2.6, though.

&gt;<i> Incompatibilities are a given when you switch between two different
</I>&gt;<i> data models. The incompatibilities don't have to be wire-level, but
</I>&gt;<i> they *will* occur at the higher level anyway.
</I>
The thing that worries is me is unnecessary or harmful incompatibilities
that are a result of misunderstanding (e.g. the banana thing, which was an
unnecessary wire protocol change). Submitting patches would have the
benefit of letting someone else help you make these decisions; it's
unreasonable to expect you to become an expert on every single API in
Twisted.

&gt;<i> Without wanting to sound unconstructive, the &quot;right way&quot; (the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;byte-sized&quot; approach) does not sound workable. Some 3.x-related patches
</I>&gt;<i> (not mine) have been lingering for years, although they are trivial. And
</I>&gt;<i> these patches (mine and the others) are really the tip of iceberg.
</I>
There aren't any python 3 patches in the review queue at the moment; do
you have any specific tickets in mind? If they're ready to go they should
have the &quot;review&quot; keyword set (if they haven't addressed review comments
then that is why they aren't merged).

&gt;<i> *Assuming* we find a clean solution to the bytes literal problem, I
</I>&gt;<i> could try to slice all of that into &quot;byte-sized&quot; patches into which I
</I>&gt;<i> inject version-checking boilerplate, but that would mean a large waste
</I>&gt;<i> of time and energy:
</I>&gt;<i> - for me, as I post dozens of small patches and have to follow up on
</I>&gt;<i>   them, and wait for them to be checked in
</I>&gt;<i> - for you, as you have to review these patches without perhaps even
</I>&gt;<i>   being Python 3 users yourselves, and without Python 3 compatibility
</I>&gt;<i>   being on your priority list
</I>
Most of us aren't Windows users either, but we still try to support
Windows :)
