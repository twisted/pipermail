I agree with this.  However, this doesn't mean that untested changes can 
go in (not that I think you're suggesting otherwise).
The serial port case was (and is) challenging because the code had no 
test coverage at all (#3690 adds a small bit of coverage), so no change 
was possible without figuring out a testing strategy.  Even *manual* 
testing is challenging - I had a serial device at one port but I can't 
find the cable anymore.  It would have been nice if someone had thought 
to use the more focused testing approach (that #3690 ended up taking) 
earlier on in the ticket's life.
