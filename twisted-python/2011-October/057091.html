Pretty sure I'm talking about TCP re-segmentation.

&gt;<i> If you mean TCP re-segmentation, then I have no data. The only places

Hrm.  Now that I think of it, the packets I was examining were probably coming from environments that were heavily managed by &quot;smart&quot; networking hardware, although I could only see the edges of the network.  So it was probably a combination of high-level transparent proxies and wacky load-balancing and caching hardware.

&gt;<i> If you mean IP fragmentation, I claim that fragmentation by routers in 
</I>&gt;<i> the internet is rare. Whether it's 1% or 0.001% I couldn't say, but the 
</I>&gt;<i> vast majority of the time, routers do not end up fragmenting. For one 
</I>&gt;<i> thing, an awful lot of OSes send TCP segments with &quot;don't fragment&quot; set, 
</I>&gt;<i> to trigger ICMP error messages and path MTU discovery. For another, a 
</I>&gt;<i> lot of low MTU networks employ TCP MSS clamping to prevent this ever 
</I>&gt;<i> happening.
</I>
That's interesting, and good to know :).

&gt;<i> For what it's worth, this &quot;layer of the network&quot; is my day job, but I 
</I>&gt;<i> don't claim oracle status.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But the sizes are also not important.  The point is that TCP is about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> streams, not packets, and you have to deal with arbitrary chunking if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you want your code to work right.  What layer of the network this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happens at is not important to your code :).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>
Since this is your day job - is there a formally-correct name for this phenomenon?  I usually refer to it as &quot;packet fragmentation&quot; even though I know that's not really it - as you say, IP fragmentation doesn't really happen. It's not like it's really TCP re-segmenting either, because one send() is not necessarily one segment.

Since it's such an important concept that every Twisted developer needs to know, I'd love to have a good word for it :).
