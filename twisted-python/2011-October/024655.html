Yes, I've started doing that. However, the extent of these patches is
quite limited.
Most changes I have to make have to do with introducing bytes literals,
or fixing specific issues under Python 3. For example, I could post the
following patch for t.p.failure, but would you accept it?

&gt;<i> I notice you have banana getting extra op code for bytes... I think a

</I>
Indeed, this is debatable. But generally, marshalling libraries have to
evolve a bit when ported to Python 3. There's no way the semantic gap
between 2.x and 3.x can be ignored.

I think banana in 3.x *has* to support both types. str is a fundamental
type in 3.x (think that class names, function names, filenames, etc.
all are str by default) and not supporting it in a marshalling library
would be pretty much awkward. bytes is fundamental in a networking
library and not supporting it would be similarly awkward :)

Moreover, 3.x has a natural preference for unicode strings while
2.x has a natural preference for 8-bit strings. Where high-level
data is handled, Python 3 users will expect to use str object, not bytes
objects, for text data (if you marshal e.g. a class name, you don't
expect it to come out as bytes... and neither would Perspective
Broker, I guess). Str objects also have more features, which make them
more amenable to parsing and formatting.

That's why I think translating the &quot;string&quot; type to 3.x str objects is
what users would expect in practice. This is also the decision
taken in the standard pickle module: if you unpickle a 2.x pickle
containing str objects, you get 3.x str objects (not bytes).

&gt;<i> In general, anywhere existing Twisted code uses a Python 2 normal
</I>&gt;<i> string, you should have the Python 3 version only accept bytes.
</I>
Due to the aforementioned differences, I don't think that's as simple.
For example, filenames are pretty much str (unicode) by default in
Python 3, even though you can also use bytes (but it's discouraged
under Windows). Command-line arguments are also str, as are many other
things. And I'll think you'll agree that it's more natural to ask for
the HTTP &quot;GET&quot; method than for the b&quot;GET&quot; method.

(no, I haven't started on twisted.web yet)

Regards

Antoine.
