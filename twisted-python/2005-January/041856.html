<PRE>&gt;<i> I am fairly experienced with Python (I also use wxPython a lot), and
</I>&gt;<i> I have a fair amount of experience with TCP/IP in terms of mechanics
</I>&gt;<i> and troubleshooting.  I have almost no experience in network
</I>&gt;<i> programming.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am working on a computer graphics application (Python/C++ hybrid)
</I>&gt;<i> which demands a lot of CPU time.  I am in the planning stages of
</I>&gt;<i> converting it to distribute the work over many computers on the same
</I>&gt;<i> local network (although I would eventually like to expand that as
</I>&gt;<i> well).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There will be a main computer which checks to see who is available to
</I>&gt;<i> participate.  That main computer will also be helping with the
</I>&gt;<i> processing load.  After that, it is basically all computers sending
</I>&gt;<i> out either requests for information or sending data in response to a
</I>&gt;<i> request (data can also be sent unsolicited).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I guess my question is--is Twisted more than what I need?
</I>
Of course it is, and all for the better. At the same time, it's
*exactly* what you need. :-)


&gt;<i> I am sure it will do the job.  I have read quite a bit of material on
</I>&gt;<i> the web site already.
</I>
And you are probably right.


&gt;<i> But would it be faster and easier to just code this by hand
</I>
It most probably wouldn't, since you state not having much experience in
network programming.


&gt;<i> or to use some other network programming framework/development tool?
</I>
None there I know of, in the Python world, and maybe elsewhere too.
Perspective Broker alone is a dream come true, for distributed applications.

Like, we have all we need to make the world a better place for
everyone, and yet here we are, screwing up, day after day. Too slow.
Let's pick up the pace here, shall we? -- Kirby Urner, December 2004
