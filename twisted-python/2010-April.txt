Hi,

I'm a long term user of twisted with nevow on top mainly using the 
athena part with LivePage and LiveElement for RPC between Python and 
JScript. nevow/athena opens up a whole new world of transparently 
calling from server to browser and vice versa on a permanent connection. 
With a slight change (three lines) a nevow/athena 'permanent connection' 
also survives network outages of up to a minute like the ones 
experienced in mobile 3G networks.

Recently I've combined twisted/nevow with qooxdoo http://www.qooxdoo.org 
allowing injection/removal of widgets including code into a livepage 
thus providing not only a 'real app' but a real desktop user experience 
in a browser.

If you want to have a look at some demos please feel free to hit

http://nqx.thieprojects.ch          minimal nevow/qooxdoo samples
http://telinfo.thieprojects.ch      Swiss telephone book lookup
http://differenzler.thieprojects.ch Minmal Jass cardgame

To see code (use Firebug, JScript is not obfuscated) done starting from 
2006 till recently.

Part of the above mentioned technology was used in a larger card game 
setup for the Swiss National TV providing a multi player game site with 
various games of Jass. Currently around 25k games are played by about 
70k users a day.

http://www.samschtigjass.ch

The 'Einzelspieler-Version' can be played without logging in.

I've also written experimental stuff bridging XMPP and browser with 
nevow/athena, using XMPP/pubsub for real time data exchange, though for 
this I have no public available samples.

This is definitely a plug but after four years of working in the field 
of RIAs it seems to me that nevow/athena is the most advanced of all 
implementations revolving around 'long polling', permanent connections, 
websockets and related technologies. It solves a host of problems which 
you have to tackle when using other technologies.

HTH, Werner

Hello all,

I've subscribed the Launchpad team https://launchpad.net/~twisted-dev
to receive mail about bugs on the "twisted" source package in Ubuntu.

It will add a small amount of email traffic to anyone who's a member
of that team. However, it will let us know about bugs that Ubuntu
users experience that are due to Twisted.

I'll gladly unsubscribe the team if folk complain loudly enough.

Thanks,

Would it be fair to say that when developing code that utilizes
inlineCallbacks, your function is a generator that returns a deferred
whose callback is the coroutine that's yielding?

Thanks for the help, but how do I access the session?  What would be
the method call to put the data into a session for instance?

The protocol instance *is* the session (or, as I would normally say "the 
protocol instance has a one to one relationship with a connection", but 
I think that's what you mean when you say "the session").  You can 
define whichever methods and attributes you want.

It's a regular Python object.  All the regular stuff you know about 
Python objects applies.

It pays to be very very specific about all the different objects and
interactions going on with generators in Python and especially with
inlineCallbacks to avoid confusion.There are a couple of inaccuracies
in this statement, some which I think are just about poor wording and
some which come from misunderstanding.

In Python, there are generator functions and there are generators.
Calling a generator function returns a generator, which has next() and
send() methods. Generators do not return things, though a generator's
next() or send() methods do (I say this because you mentioned a
"generator that returns a deferred").

Also, there's nothing called a "coroutine" that's related to
inlineCallbacks at all, and the word is fraught with ambiguities in
Python, so it's best to just avoid it entirely.

In inlineCallbacks, nobody but the person writing the
inlineCallbacks-using function knows that there's a generator
involved. The person calling your inlineCallbacks-using function can't
see any generators; they just get a Deferred object which fires when
the generator is exhausted. The interesting part is that
inlineCallbacks is the thing responsible for iterating the generator,
not user-code. It is responsible for calling .send() on the generator
object when previously yielded deferreds have fired. The value of the
Deferred returned will be whatever is passed to returnValue in the
inlineCallbacks-using function.

Hi Christopher,

Apologize for the sloppy language. So would this be a better way of putting it?

Assuming a function func_a that has the inlineCallbacks decorator...

If func_a were added as a callback for a deferred (deferred 1), when
func_a was called another deferred would be returned (deferred 2)
which would only fire once func_a had run to the end of the function
and returned.

While func_a is running, every time yield is called, this would
operate similarly to writing a separate callback for the contents of
each of those yield statements and chaining them normally to each
other as callbacks.

That is this:

@defer.inlineCallbacks
def func_a(value):
   num = yield do_something(value)
   num2 = yield do_something_more(num)
   return num2

is equivalent to:

def func_a(value):
    return do_something(value).addCallback(cb_step_1)

def cb_step_1(num):
    return do_something_more(num).addCallback(cb_step_2)

def cb_step_2(num2):
    return num2


Thank you very much for your help in understanding this.  I've always
used a combination of deferreds and callbacks/errbacks to this point.

Hi Steve,

> Have you continued, or do you plan to continue development where it was left off?

Well, it's something I've only be toying with. I can handle all the
specific Twisted fixes I'd like to make:
  - handling lost connections gracefully
  - proper use of twistd and daemonization
  - massive code cleanups

The only problem is that I'm not that knowledgeable about the
Javascript browser hacks they've employed - their Orbited.js is more
than half "magic" to me (probably due to me not having an opportunity
to work on a large js project). It's something that I'd like to get
into, if someone is willing to take the lead on the javascript side.
It could potentially be as simple as slotting in js.io
(http://github.com/mcarter/js.io), which Orbited.js has apparently
become, and which appears to have been the plan for Orbited 0.8.

> They all seem to have gone off to play with node.js instead.

I don't *really* blame them, considering most of the project's merit
lay in the Javascript realm, and node.js is basically a (less
featurful) version of Twisted for Javascript (of course with the added
bonus of using a heavily JITed and optimized Javascript VM).

> Very cool, I hadn't seen that before.

Yes, very neat. Haven't done much with it, but I think it's a real
winner when you're doing something simple like long-polling/
broadcasting from a queue.

Cheers,
Reza

I would very much support you continuing development on Orbited.
In fact, I believe I can help, or already have patches for most of the
above issues you mention.  A lot of this is result of my "Hotdot" project,
"Create realtime webapps using Django + Orbited + Twisted":
http://github.com/clemesha/hotdot

Specifically, see here for Orbited and twistd working together:
http://github.com/clemesha/hotdot/blob/master/server.py

and see the below for patches that improve handling lost connections gracefully:
http://gist.github.com/256582

Finally, it would be awesome if you put up your improvements on Github
(just a suggestion :-),
then I can easily fork and starting adding improvements, and you can
pull and we can move this forward.

p.s. I haven't found many issues with the frontend JavaScript code, but if you
have specific issues that you could point out, I'd love to try to help.

I had worked with your hotdot stuff a while ago, and I think I had even sent you some django csrf patches for Django 1.2 compatibility (it was a while ago...)

Back then, I had started on refactoring the one-big-javascript file in Orbited a few months ago but, at the time, was assured that 0.8 was "just around the corner", so I left it alone.

Well...now I have need and, since Athena seems to be tightly tied to Nevow, cometd is itself, websocket is websocket, so I'm looking again.   Since Orbited seems to have gone into "unmaintained mode", I agree, it may just be time for a fork.

Mostly the problems I had with it were the lack of doc, and the all-in-one 2700 line .js file, and the complete lack of unit tests of any type.

The js.io site documentation link says "Sorry, we don't have documentation yet", and the doc directory on github has a powerpoint file and an echo server so I'm not sure that's going to help so much.

Well, if there's interest on reviving Orbited either as itself, or as a new project with some code from Orbited as well as some of Alex's stuff, I'm in.

I've cloned orbited to BitBucket to take up a fork of the project.  

	http://bitbucket.org/ssteinerx/orbited-new/overview/

I really need this for a project and since the old Orbited seems to be abandoned, I'm taking it on.

Contributions gladly accepted.  

If you're interested in working on it, I'll be happy to give you write access.

I've sent an e-mail to CarterMichael at gmail.com to see whether he'll give an official blessing to this fork once we've moved it forward a bit.

Thanks,

S

I'm interested in doing some FUSE stuff with Twisted, mostly to
prototype some ideas for profiling. Can anyone expand on Glyph's
comment [1]:

The Python FUSE bindings obscure the issue because, unlike the C
libfuse, they assume that your filesystem I/O is blocking, which
severely limits the performance of python-based filesystems. ?(You
cannot receive more requests for I/O in your filesystem until the
previous one has been completed with the pyfuse bindings, but you can in
C.)

I guess I'd like to know before I sink too much time into this, if
there's an approach to Fuse/Twisted that would not have this
limitation. This is a bit confused by the fact that there are three
Fuse/Python bindings that I'm aware of: FusePython, FusePy, and S3QL
[2].

If you've already been down this road, it'd be good to hear from you.

So, sitting at the bottom of libfuse is a file descriptor.  The kernel 
asks your process to service some filesystem operation by putting bytes 
into it that your process can read.  Your process services the requests 
by putting bytes into it that the kernel can read.

Each request/response pair is tagged, so there's no requirement that 
requests be responded to in the same order they're received.

A good Twisted-based solution would use the reactor to read and write 
that file descriptor (alongside anything else going on in the process) 
and support Deferreds (or at least asynchronous responses) to allow out- 
of-order responses and concurrent request handling.

I played around with fuse a little bit to implement something like sshfs 
a while ago.  I did _not_ use the approach described above, because it 
was easier to use something from Armin Rigo's sandbox in a thread, 
dispatching request handling into Twisted, to achieve the necessary 
concurrency and so forth.  You can find that code here:

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/sandbox/exarkun/sshfs.py?rev=26941

It's just something I was messing around with.  I'm sure you'll find 
lots of problems with it (I know of at least one).  It might help with 
part of the general idea, though.  To get rid of the use of threads 
(which is a good idea for a real tool), you just need to port Armin's 
parsing code into a Twisted Protocol class and hook it up to a 
FileDescriptor of some sort that reads and writes the fuse fd.

I wrote some code for this a while ago. I don't remember anything
about it, but it might be a reasonable place to start. I put it up at
http://xzrq.net/ignite.tar.gz

It requires sendmsg extension from

	and hash
Message-ID: <9839287.287071270428092489.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

Hi all,
   I use FilePasswordDB with a small smtp-server (a very small toy), but when 
I use the hash function the authentication doesn't work.

Here few lines of code:
"""
def _hash(name, clearpsw, hashedpsw):
    # a very simple hash function ?
    return md5.md5(clearpsw).hexdigest()
    # return 'aa'

# doesn't work; password file content is correctly "hashed"
smtpusers = checkers.FilePasswordDB('smtppasswords.txt', caseSensitive=True, 
hash=_hash, cache=True)

# work! in the file the passwords are in plain text
#smtpusers = checkers.FilePasswordDB('smtppasswords.txt', caseSensitive=True, 
cache=True)

mailservice = mail.MailService()
mailservice.setQueue(relaymanager.Queue(QUEUE_PATH))
mailservice.smtpPortal.registerChecker(smtpusers)
smtpserver = mailservice.getESMTPFactory()
application = service.Application("Console SMTP Server")
internet.TCPServer(SMTP_PORT, smtpserver).setServiceParent(application)
"""

The error is:
Failure: twisted.cred.error.UnhandledCredentials: No checker for twisted.cred.
credentials.IUsernameHashedPassword

Obviously FilePasswordDB doesn't provide that credential when there is the 
hash function; why smtp connection is hashed and not in plaintext? How can I 
get it works?

I found a similar question, with no answer:
http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2006-November/014395.html

Can't say for sure without a full example, but it looks like you are
providing an instance of credentials.UsernameHashedPassword to
portal.login when you should be providing a credentials.UsernamePassword
instance.

If you provide a hash function to FilePasswordDB, it only accepts
IUsernamePassword credentials. The hash function is for plaintext
passwords that need to be validated against a hashed password file.

If your passwords are already hashed before they are sent to the server
for authentication, then there is no need for a hash function.
FilePasswordDB will accept either IUsernamePassword or
IUsernameHashedPassword credentials.

The source comments make it a bit clearer:

Subject: [Twisted-Python] data update to multiple clients
Message-ID: <C75176A3-261F-4FE4-8D1E-F2C32AB30D7D@cusack.net.au>

Probably another newbie question but after much effort I am not  
progressing on the following.

I am trying to design a system where I have a microprocessor  
periodically feeding data on a serial connection to a server script. I  
would then like the server script to notify one or more client scripts  
of the changed data across a local network. I have tried a few simple  
tcp server and client script examples which communicate well for a  
single call but do not seem to suit my application which is not client  
event driven. I considered having each client connect to the server  
every ?? seconds to query for new data but there may be a better way.

Can anyone suggest a suitable design approach using twisted? Is there  
any example code available that may be similar.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but it's pretty simple. Just have the 
clients connect & stay connected. Keep a list of currently connected 
clients somewhere (see below) and every time you receive data on the 
serial port, write it out to all the clients. For example:

# ack, global variable!
client_list = []

class MyProtocol(Protocol):
   def connectionMade(self):
     client_list.append(self)

   def connectionLost(self, reason):
     if self in client_list:
       client_list.remove(self)

   def notifyClient(self, data):
     # you will probably want some framing here e.g. Netstring, len+data
     self.transport.write(data)

class ServerProto(Protocol):
   def dataReceived(self, data):
     for cli in client_list:
       cli.notifyClient(data)

...or am I misunderstanding you?

First of all, thanks for your answer :-)

Here the full source code:

from twisted.mail import mail, relaymanager
from twisted.cred import checkers
from twisted.python import log
from twisted.application import internet
from twisted.application import service
import os, md5

SMTP_PORT = 25
QUEUE_PATH = './users_home/insertionQueue'

if not os.path.exists(QUEUE_PATH):
    os.makedirs(QUEUE_PATH)

def _hash(name, clearpsw, hashedpsw):
    return 'aa'
    return md5.md5(clearpsw).hexdigest()

# doesnt' work# smtpusers = checkers.FilePasswordDB('smtppasswords.txt', 
caseSensitive=True, hash=_hash, cache=True)
smtpusers = checkers.FilePasswordDB('smtppasswords.txt', caseSensitive=True, 
cache=True)

mailservice = mail.MailService()
mailservice.setQueue(relaymanager.Queue(QUEUE_PATH))
mailservice.smtpPortal.registerChecker(smtpusers)
smtpserver = mailservice.getESMTPFactory()
application = service.Application("Console SMTP Server")
internet.TCPServer(SMTP_PORT, smtpserver).setServiceParent(application)

I read the source code, I'm agree with this point

>FilePasswordDB will accept either IUsernamePassword or

I want to hash the password on the server; can't I? How I can decide to use a 
simple IUsernamePassword?

however If I don't use the hash function the connection still continue to use 
an IUsernameHashedPassword.
Probably the smtp connection is not made for a plain-text password, isn't it?

This sounds like it may be a FAQ:

Does that answer your question?

It sounds to me like you want the server to support PLAIN auth but still
compare against a hashed password file? The ESMTP factory you are using
only provides CRAM-MD5 auth via credentials.

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk/twisted/mail/protocols.py#L132

CramMD5Credentials implements IUsernameHashedPassword, so it won't work
with a FilePasswordDB checker that has a hash function. This is the
source of your error message.

You can add PLAIN support by adding credentials that provide
IUsernamePassword. The imap4 implementation has one (PLAINCredentials):

...
from twisted.mail import imap4
smtpserver = mailservice.getESMTPFactory()
smtpserver.challengers['PLAIN'] = imap4.PLAINCredentials
application = service.Application("Console SMTP Server")
...

Clients using CRAM-MD5 will still fail with the same error, though. You
could create your own checker which differentiates how it checks based
on the provided credentials interface. You would start by subclassing
FilePasswordDB and override the requestAvatarId method. If the
credentials interface is IUsernameHashedPassword, just skip over the
hash function. Here's an example based on yours:

FilePasswordDB can already check IUsernameHashedPassword credentials as 
long as you construct it without a hash function.

I don't know if there is a particular reason for silencing the errors.
But most classes in basic.py do not emit any log messages (the only
exception is StatefulStringProtocol).

BTW: There is a ticket about NetstringReceiver - you might want to 
add your request there:

I have been wondering how I could develop a python application which would
make it easy for users of this application to share small amounts of textual
information over the Internet.

The information is not confidential but I would like to ensure that it is
coming from and generated by the application in question using ssl. I want
it to be easy for users of the application to identify and communicate with
other users of the application.

What type of network am I talking about here? I have plenty of programming
experience, but not much network programming experience. Any advice would be
appreciated.

I think you need to define your application functionality a little
more. You could be describing anything from a web app that implements
a pasteboard, to a web service shuffling JSON objects around or
anything in between.

Thanks Jason,

Okay, lets say that two users are using this hypothetical application. Each
user has some files on his/her system that were installed locally (as part
of the installation or from disk or whatever). Lets assume that both users
have the same files for the sake of this discussion. The application stores
some unique identifiers for each of these files. From a high level point of
view I would like the users to be able to send a list of identifiers to
another user of the system over the internet to indicate which documents to
view and in what order. There may also be some additional textual data
involved to represent segues between the files to be viewed.

Being new to network programming I am not sure what the simplest way is to
accomplish the task. The nature of the data being communicated is not
confidential but I would like to be reasonably sure that the data is being
generated and sent from the application and user in question.

How will users identify themselves to others for communication. I would like
a user to be able to tell another user what his "address" is and have that
user be able to enter that address into the application and use it whenever
he wishes to send that particular user a sequence of id's and text to be
parsed by the application.

I suppose the application will be acting as both server and client. Any
thoughts?

Thanks again

Brian

Sounds like a peer-to-peer model and you need to use an SSL factory
for your protocols. The rest...authentication etc is really something
for you to put together.

Hi Brian,

> thoughts?

For the network part you're certainly describing a P2P model. These
applications are essentially text messaging each other various bits of
info. Keep in mind with P2P stuff - it's notoriously hard to be
*really* P2P without having some element of centrality/servers. The
reason is that what seems like simple communication between two
computers on the internet really goes through firewalls and Nats and
cable modems and what not. The internet - or rather the Internet as
its commonly referred to - is really a collection of public hubs
(websites, mail servers, etc.) which users traverse through their
layers of NATs and firewalls to get to. Usually only ports 80 and 443
(HTTP and HTTPS) are open on these NATs and firewalls, hence why you
don't see a proliferation of other random protocols and applications,
besides a handful. Skype or Kazaa are P2P systems that use a hybrid
approach of relaying via central, publicly accessible "supernodes"
which are promoted on the fly.

Anyway, most people take the easy way out and have one or more servers
sitting somewhere that their clients connect to. Not that the P2P
problem isn't fun ;-)

Here's one of many solutions: get one or more publicly available
servers, and stick some XMPP software (twisted.words, Punjab,
ejabberd, whatever). Turn on SSL. Now you have a secure, centralized
communications system.

Another solution, if you want to go down the "real P2P" route, is to start maintaining Divmod Vertex <http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodVertex> - it's a pretty good proof of concept, and solves many of the really hard problems (especially NAT traversal), but it will definitely need to be fixed up if you want to deploy it in a real-world application.

Hello Brian,
You can start with one server and one client on each side.
If privacy is not a concern for your application, you don't need to
encrypt the data over SSL.

The easiest to use is a basic LineReceiver and a line sender. Next,
you can use JSON if you want to send more than text.
Look at the examples !

TIP: The sender might tell the other peer on which port its receiver
is listening.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Seeking advice: Coping with heavy log file loads
Message-ID: <4BBEE6E7.2000905@vultaire.net>

There may not be a clear answer to this problem, and the answer may or
may not be Twisted-specific.  I'm just trying to fish for ideas here.

The server I'm working on suffers from extremely high CPU time spent in
the logging functions.  I'm spending between 30 and 40% of all CPU time
just in twisted.python.log.msg.

Describing the environment:

We use DailyLogFiles for file rotation along with the
PythonLoggingObserver to allow for logLevel support.  (Of course, this
gives us significant overhead from Python's complex logging
architecture; maybe we should drop this...)

On a 1000 request test of this server, we generate 58,274 calls to
t.p.log.msg.  There's room for cleanup, but there's lots of pressure to
keep many of the log calls we have for forensic purposes, so we can only
cut this back so far.

Anyway, does anyone have any ideas for speedups?  Any stories from
experience especially?  Shots in the dark are welcome.  ;-)

A request/log ratio of 1:60 is extreme. I would call that a log
generator ;-)

I think you could try to use a custom light weight log function that
just queues the log messages (FIFO) and bursts them, say every second,
to the log file (e.g. in a thread to use a multicore cpu).

I don't know if this will help you, but why do you need to route
through Python's logging framework for log-level support?

For example, Twisted's SyslogObserver support allows the use of syslog
log levels without involving Python's logging system:

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.syslog.SyslogObserver.html

If Python's logging framework doesn't show up in your profile output as
an appreciable percentage of the time spent in Twisted's logging
framework, I guess you might as well leave it alone - but if it is
contributing, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out a way to work
around it.

Hi.

Does twisted have a Mercurial (git is also fine) mirror?

Unofficial mirror is ok; I just would like to avoid download entire svn
history with hgsvn.

Or:

0. Profile logging system - what exactly is it doing that's using all
that CPU? If you're unlucky, it's just "lots of Python function calls",
but maybe it's fixable.

1. A log function that sends messages (over e.g. a Unix socket) to
another process that does the writing. Python GIL means you don't get
that much benefit from multiple threads.

2. Rewrite log function in C... and then maybe run it in another thread.

Duh. Of course.

BTW. syslog from the syslog module on linux just opens a unix socket
to /dev/log and could be used to do just this. (e.g. with log level
LOG_LOCAL0 and configuring your syslog to log facility local0 to a
specific file)

Hi Paul,

Is is sporadic? (the CPU burst) If so, you may be seeing the log
rotation code kicking...and it's probably blocking your app too until
it completes.

I've got a couple patches to fix the blocking issue:

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4372

The patch which eliminates old log rotation will probably get rid of
your CPU problem too.

Definitely use syslog.  To see how much logging is costing you without
changing code, you can simply route to /dev/null via syslog.  Btw, w/ local
logging, you may not see it in the cpu usage - more likely in the i/o wait.
 In my experience, logging to a remote syslog-ng server over udp has very
little impact on the app, almost like logging to /dev/null (which in turn is
like not logging at all).

Are you by chance on AWS/EC2 ?  If so, please contact me to discuss possible
design partnership.

Just wanted to respond to the input everyone's given.  Thanks a lot; I'm
glad I asked.

I'll probably look into the syslog route.  I thought about it before,
but I wasn't sure how much flexibility it gives.  Given the suggestions
here, I've since looked into it a little more and it seems to be the
smartest route, especially due to the size of the load.

Thanks everyone!

You might find the logging infrastructure in Foolscap interesting:

 http://foolscap.lothar.com/docs/logging.html

The basic idea is to record log events only in memory, in separate
circular buffers for each priority level. When something "weird"
happens, all the events are bundled into an "Incident File", and then
the incident file is written out (either to disk, or to a gatherer
process over a network). Other tools are then used to reassemble the
pieces of the incident into chronological order and point out where the
gaps are.

I haven't done any specific performance measurements, but I've taken a
busy server and stubbed out the logging calls and didn't see a huge
change in throughput rate. The Foolscap approach gets you useful (and
detailed) information when bad things happen, but throws out most of the
other stuff, so it doesn't touch the disk or make system calls very often.

cheers,
 -Brian (author of Foolscap)

Subject: [Twisted-Python] [ANN] txwsgi 0.1
Message-ID: <4BC22812.7070708@libero.it>

I'm pleased to announce txwsgi, version 0.1.

txwsgi is a fork of twisted.web.wsgi, that, unlike the original
implementation, executes the WSGI application in the main I/O thread.

txwsgi implements the x-wsgiorg.suspend extension (originally proposed
during a discussion on the twisted-web mailing list!), that enables
support to asynchronous WSGI applications that can use Twisted API.

Some examples are available in the doc/examples directory, in the source
distribution.

The project is available on BitBucket:
http://bitbucket.org/mperillo/txwsgi/

More informations are available in the README file.
The x-wsgiorg.suspend extension is specified in doc/wsgiorg.suspend.rst.

Please note that I implemented txwsgi to serve as a reference
implementation.  If someone is interested in using it for non testing
purpose, please let me know since the code needs to be reviewed, some
small issues needs to be fixed and tests must be written.

Well, the only way to run Python code is to run the Python interpreter
in a process and feed it the python code you want to run (using the -c
option).

Hi Reza,

yes, I'd thought of that, but I can't get the function's code, I tried 
the inspect module but
it only works of the code is written to disk; I'd rather not have to 
first write the code to disk just to be able to turn it into a string 
and feed it to python -c. Any ideas on how I could do this?

Thanks,
Gabriel

You don't have to write it to disk - you can use cStringIO.

That's interesting. :) You would write string in a string buffer
that's in the memory, and then... how do you pass it to the child
process? You could not get a pointer to the same location in memory,
as far as I know. You would still need a socket, or something like
that. Am I wrong?

Sticking with "python -c" is probably easiest.

Hi Gabriel,

You might want to try Python's multiprocessing code, it works very
well. I've had pretty good luck using it with Twisted inside the
processes too. The multiprocessing library handles the work of setting
up the send and receive file descriptors.

Sorry, please disregard this - I was thinking about something else.

The way I've done Python process spawning before was to have my code
predefined in a string, and then launched via a ProcessProtocol. You
can do tricks whereby you have your code actually defined in a string,
then you generate your Python source to run tests/etc. on *that*, and
then you send your code-string to python -c when you actually want to
run it in a separate process.

I remember playing around with inspect before, but I gave up at some
point and took the path of least resistance.

Cheers,
Reza

Hi Jason,

yes, I was going to use that but I read in several threads that this 
didn't work correctly in Twisted

IMO Jason probably has a lurking bug that he just hasn't noticed so far.

Same thing with using subprocess instead of the Twisted equivalent
inside a Twisted reactor.  IMX it works 99% of the time.  Murphy's Law
says it'll pass cursory testing and then fail in production.

Haven't had any issues yet. Twisted imports occur inside the process
function. The app was originally written as a purely blocking
multiprocessing app and rewritten to use Twisted inside the
sub-processes. It's passed all automated and hand tests without an
issue. Is there a reason importing Twisted inside sub-process should
not work?

I frequently use a model like this:


#!/usr/bin/python

import sys
# and loads of twisted imports

# function to run in a child process
def work():
     while True:
         cmd = sys.stdin.readline()
         if not cmd:
             break
         # do something
         sys.stdout.write('result\n')
         sys.stdout.flush()

class MyProcessProtocol(protocol.ProcessProtocol):
     def __init__(self):
         self.buffer = ''
         self.queue = []

     def outReceived(self, data):
         self.buffer += data
         while '\n' in self.buffer:
             reply, self.buffer = self.buffer.split('\n', 1)
             d,c = self.queue.pop(0)
             d.callback(reply)

         if self.queue:
             self.transport.write('%s\n' % (self.queue[0][1],)

     def cmd(self, c):
         d = defer.Deferred()
         if self.queue:
             # just enqueue it
             self.queue.append((d,c))
         else:
             # hang onto the deferred and also send the cmd
             self.queue.append((d,c))
             self.transport.write(c+'\n')
         return d

def parent():
     proto = MyProcessProtocol()
     reactor.spawnProcess(
         proto,
        sys.executable,
        (sys.executable, os.path.abspath(__file__), 'WORKER')
     )

     # write some commands to the child
     d = proto.send_cmd('something')
     d.addCallback(result).addErrback(failed)

def twisted_main():
     reactor.callWhenRunning(parent)
     reactor.run()

def main():
     args = sys.argv[1:]
     if args and args[0]=='WORKER':
         # we're a child process
         work()
     else:
         twisted_main()

if __name__=='__main__':
     main()


It's pretty simple; you need to be sure that the module does all the 
imports it needs in the child process. You can extend the above model to 
something more complex than simple line-based results, using e.g. JSON 
or python pickle, to handle exceptions, and so forth.

IMHO Twisted REALLY REALLY needs something built-in to do this. I'm 
aware of Ampoule; it didn't work for me when I tried it (which was a 
while ago) and having to define AMP commands to use it was a bit of a 
turn off for me.

I will say importing your reactor (from twisted.internet import
reactor) must be done inside the sub-process or you won't get what you
want.

When I last looked at it, multiprocessing did awful things like fork'ing 
and not re-execing the interpreter in the child process, which seemed 
like an absolute disaster waiting to happen, for many types of objects 
which the child process inherits. Does it still do that?

I guess what you're doing will work though, In that setup, where the 
multiprocessing code is the absolute first thing you call, you're 
essentially using it as a helper to fork off the child process & setup 
the communication pipes (see the example I just posted for a more 
explicit example).

There's the issue that any multiprocess code which writes to the pipes 
(or whatever) used for sending results will block (and block the 
reactor) of course.

Yeah...our code doesn't actually use the pipes. They get fed over AMQP
(txAMQP). We're essentially using multiprocessing as a sub-proc
supervisor to spin-up "processing" engines that consume the AMQP
queues they're configured with.

Here's JP's canonical answer:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1948641/twisted-threading-with-subprocess-popen

I've seen this problem in real code.  We had a PyGTK + Twisted program
that erroneously used subprocess in one place.  2% of the time, it
caused an exception.  98% of the time, it worked fine.  Classic race
condition.  Could be you have a similar bug but it never actually
manifests on your combination of code, OS, and hardware.  Hard to say.

The comment about passing installSignalHandlers=False to reactor.run()
is good to know. Are the signal handlers Twisted installs used by
Twisted for anything besides reactor.spawnProcess() or other tasks
related to sub-process management?

I've noted this in a comment on the stackoverflow answer, but it bears repeating:

This was a long-standing bug in Twisted which has since been fixed on trunk, although it isn't present in a release: <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/733>.  Starting with the next release (Twisted 10.1, we hope), you should be able to do this without getting this particular type of error.

Still, I wouldn't recommend using the subprocess module in a Twisted application, and multiprocessing even less.  'subprocess' uses select(), which means that if you are running processes in a server handling a large number of connections with a reactor that you've selected for that job, you will occasionally notice that '.communicate()' will blow up because your file descriptors are too big to fit into a select() call.  Its handling of EINTR and EAGAIN are less consistent than spawnProcess, you can't independently handle subprocess termination and subprocess-closing-its-output, so certain types of bugs are much tricker to track down... and I'm sure there are other issues, but I haven't had an opportunity to thoroughly audit it.

Multiprocessing has its own subtly *differently* wonky implementation of subprocess spawning (it uses os.fork(), not the subprocess module), it uses pickle to move objects between processes, and it seems to spawn threads internally, which means it depends on correct thread/process (and hey, maybe thread/pickle too) interaction.

Both of these will work reasonably well for small applications; multiprocessing is *great* if you have a simple, straightforward little multithreaded thing that you want to make multiprocess in order to take advantage of multiple cores.  But by the time you've already taken the trouble to learn how to use Twisted, IMHO spawnProcess is a lot more powerful and a lot less trouble than either of these solutions.  Even more so if you use a higher-level abstraction over it, like ampoule: <https://launchpad.net/ampoule>.

That all makes sense to me if you're using it to coordinate between
the processes using multiprocessing's mechanisms (which I assume most
do). We just aren't. Once the processes are spawned they do their own
thing without any knowledge of each other. There something I should be
expecting to bite me in the rear by folding Twisted into this
architecture?

If you just use Twisted in the subprocesses, that sounds like it
should be fine to me.

hi all :

this msg can't write to var/log/syslog  anymore

I'm pretty sure Twisted's process.py uses select() in some cases...
possibly on import though, which would be less of an issue, I forget.

If a unix socket exists, you can't listen on it.  Delete /dev/log and 
you should be able to listen on it again.

Yeah, I don't think it's much of an issue.

It does do it on import, and then later as a fallback if that
import-time check found ?broken versions of linux? where ?write-only
pipe are detected as readable.?  This is apparently Linux < 2.6.11.

I suppose if someone does find it's an issue for them that it wouldn't
be too hard to fix, although perhaps they'd find it easier to simply
upgrade their OS...

Message-ID: <w2jbed370f31004140223v12ae440gaef9452357e3adc1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need some help in uploading large files to twisted server.
I want to upload large files on twisted server using php.But as php has
limit of 24MB, I decided to use ftp functions of php to upload large files.I
am running ftp server written in twisted.When i try to upload a file using
any ftp client then its working fine but when i use a php script for ftp
file upload then it is not working.Initially when i tried to upload file
using same php script but without passive mode , it created a file on server
but the size of file was 0 bytes.When i added a line to switch to passive
mode now it doesn't go beyond a function to switch passive mode and
connection to server gets timed out.Here is my php code



<?php
> $ftp_server='localhost';
> $ftp_user_name='chetan';
> $ftp_user_pass='chetan';
> $file = 'av.jpg';
> $remote_file = 'av.jpg';
>
> $conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server, 8002);

> } else {

 Or is there any other way i can upload large files on twisted server ?

Hello!

I've tried to profile my twisted server with --profile=path
--profiler=cProfile --savestats options for twistd and it show results
only for functions which are in main thread and it is not really
helpful, because "dirty work" is done in threads. Is it possible to
profile functions which runs in other threads?


Thanks!

twisted.protocols.amp and twisted.spread.pb both implement this.

In a nutshell: in connectionMade, initialize a dictionary on your protocol object mapping request IDs to Deferreds.  When you issue a request, make a new Deferred and put it into that dictionary.  When you receive a response, pop the Deferred out of that dictionary by looking up the key present in the response, and call its .callback() method.

Is that what you were looking for?

I wrote something like this once, I called it txScheduler.  I guess I really
should clean it up and release it.

It's not been heavily tested (and I never got around to writing the unit
tests I had intended to) but it worked for the original use case I had.

If anyone's interested, drop me a line directly and I'll send it to you (MIT
license).

Hi,
I am trying to use php script on twisted server using twcgi.I want to make
use of http POST method in that.What I want to do is, suppose I am having
one html page say index.html and from that page I want to redirect to other
php page and pass data to that php page using POST method.But I am not able
to access any POST data in php script.When I debugged through
twcgi.CGIScript.render method, I didn't find any reference to POST data.So
how can i make use of POST data in php ?

Thank You.

Hi Laurens: 

I hope to have a repository up next week. 

We're just finishing up initial implementation. 

The Basho folk helped us address a last failing unit test yesterday so our new txRiak now runs the same set of unit tests as the Basho riak.py file. 

I'll announce on this list when it is available. 
Thanks for your interest. 
(looking forward to other eyes reviewing the code)

Hey Ray, 




I'm pretty interested in txRiak. I couldn't find it at https://launchpad.net/tx . Is the repo up somewhere yet? 


Thanks

I keep an unofficial git-svn cloned copy here:
http://ludios.net/mirror/

The tarball includes all of the SVN metadata. To update it, you can:
git svn fetch && git checkout trunk

During a `git svn fetch` or another operation, you may see this error:
error: cannot lock ref 'refs/remotes/ctrl+\\-2371+2123-2'

This is due to a bug somewhere in svn or git-svn; to fix it, you can
recursively grep the .git/ directory and manually delete all references
to the branch. Everything seems to work fine after doing this.

In case anyone is curious, git-svn takes about 26 hours to mirror it,
because it restarts at r1 for several branches. I am told this is due
to the use of SVN partial branches.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] gtk2reactor: scheduling work in the immediate
 future without throttling gtk
Message-ID: <1271589118.3529.18.camel@level.fluendo.lan>

Hi.  My use case is pretty simple:

 - my UI has a throbber that gets activated while I'm querying a CouchDB
server and populating the UI with results, which can be many.
 - when iterating over the results, I want the UI to keep throbbing,
which means the gtk mainloop needs to be regularly scheduled by
gtk2reactor
 - if I iterate over the results and create a deferred chain and fire
it, the whole update of the UI still gets executed synchronously, not
giving the gtk mainloop time to throb.
 - if I do it with callLater(0, ...), again these calls get executed
ASAP and throttle the main loop

Every other workaround I can think of is ugly (using random.random() as
the argument to callLater to space calls, using a counter to space out
calls, doing callLater from the next call chain, ...)

In reality, all I want is to schedule a call to be processed with lower
priority than the main loop; ie, have the reactor run GTK's mainloop
then process my calls.  This way, I could create a chain of say 10 calls
at a time, and give the mainloop time to run between each block.

Is something like this possible at all ? How do the other reactors
handle this ? Why is priority given to the twisted DelayedCalls ?

If this is actually affecting your UI this may mean the batch size you
are processing in each call is too big. E.g. if it takes 50ms per call,
you're not going to get more than 20FPS if you run one call per
iteration. 

Something like twisted.internet.task.coiterate might help, but you still
need to make sure each chunk (or rather, size of chunk*num parallel
processes) is sufficiently small.

It'd be great if everyone who wants git access could share a single 
mirror (perhaps this one), to avoid the additional load on our svn 
server that creating a new mirror creates.

The same applies to other vcs mirrors, too, of course.

I don't really understand the question.  You have a lot of stuff going 
on here:

  * HTTP POSTs
  * Redirects
  * CGIScript
  * PHP

Can you try to describe the scenario you're trying to get working step 
by step, carefully separating each of these different pieces?

You may also want to post follow-ups to the twisted-web mailing list 
instead.

Of course, if you made a "sanctioned" mirror in GitHub & BitBucket & LaunchPad owned by the actual project, then all these others could just fade away under the weight of an "official mirror."

That's not to say you couldn't save a ton of time by forking one of the existing ones, but making "One Repo (of each type) to Rule Them All" would be way helpful..even if it doesn't read as well as the original "One Ring..."

I use Powdahound mirror at Gihub. I believe it updates daily. Perhaps,  
we could list it on the website to steer Git folks to it.

Granted we're just talking about DVCS mirrors here...but someday it  
would be really great to be able to send pull requests instead of  
patches for code enhancements. ;)

My aim is to build a server that will support file uploading on server and
uploading is to be done using web browser.So i selected php script for file
upload.
I made a simple html form.

> <html>
> <body>
> <div align="center">
> <br />
> <form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="upload_file.php" method="POST">
>  Please choose a file: <input name="upload_file" type="file" /><br />
>  <input type="submit" value="Upload" />
>  </form> </body>
> </html>
>


Now this file is sent using POST method and then it will redirect to a php
script named upload_file.php.
So to make use of php i used twcgi.PHPScript. When i checked i am not
getting POST data in php code.
Execution calls twcgi.CGIScript.render method internally.When i checked in
this render method, data sent using POST is available in request.args
variable but not sent to php CLI.
Whereas in case of GET method the url is parsed and data sent using GET
method is put in qargs variable and then sent to php CLI.

Since Twisted has an official(?) Bazaar mirror on Launchpad (that I did
not notice before), maybe it is more easy to mirror this repository,
when converting to a different VCS.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Utilizing Twisted for transport w/ SUDS
Message-ID: <q2r4e0e47491004191626p18bc0b4bmc539fb0e90917279@mail.gmail.com>

Hello-

I have a project that is based on Twisted used to
communicate with network devices and I am adding support for a new
vendor (Citrix NetScaler) whose API is SOAP.  Unfortunately the
support for SOAP in Twisted still relies on SOAPpy, which is badly out
of date. In fact as of this email (I just checked), twisted.web.soap
itself hasn't even been updated in 21 months!

I would like to ask if anyone has any experience they would be willing
to share with utilizing Twisted's superb asynchronous transport
functionality with SUDS.  It seems like plugging in a custom Twisted
transport would be a natural fit in SUDS' Client.options.transport, I'm just
having
a hard time wrapping my head around it.

I did come up with a way to call the SOAP method with SUDS
asynchronously by utilizing twisted.internet.threads.deferToThread(),
but this feels like a hack to me.

Here is an example of what I've done, just to give you an idea:

   # netscaler is a module I wrote using suds to interface with NetScaler
SOAP
   # Source: http://bitbucket.org/jathanism/netscaler-api/src
   import netscaler
   import os, sys
   from twisted.internet import reactor, defer, threads

   # netscaler.API is the class that sets up the suds.client.Client object
   host = 'netscaler.local'
   username = password = 'nsroot'
   wsdl_url = 'file://' + os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'NSUserAdmin.wsdl')
   api = netscaler.API(host, username=username, password=password,
wsdl_url=wsdl_url)

   results = []
   errors = []

   def handleResult(result):
       print '\tgot result: %s' % (result,)
       results.append(result)

   def handleError(err):
       sys.stderr.write('\tgot failure: %s' % (err,))
       errors.append(err)

   # this converts the api.login() call to a Twisted thread.
   # api.login() is equivalent to:
   # api.service.login(username=self.username, password=self.password)
   deferred = threads.deferToThread(api.login)
   deferred.addCallbacks(handleResult, handleError)

   reactor.run()

This works as expected and defers return of the api.login() call until
it is complete, instead of blocking.  But as I said, it doesn't feel
right.

Thanks in advance for any help, guidance, feedback, criticism,
insults, or total solutions.

jathan.

Hi everyone,
Two years ago, I've dropped SUDS to generate and parse the XML by
hand, using xml.dom.minidom.
I don't remember why exactly.
I hope this comment is useful for you. (?!)

I did a similar thing. I wrapped the SUDS client calls into
deferToThread by subclassing suds.Client and adding a method
callMethod which returns a deferred. Here is the code I'm using:
""" Wrapper for suds to create deferred instances. """
from suds.client import Client as SudsClient
from twisted.internet.threads import deferToThread

class Client(SudsClient):

    # method for returning a deferred for the RPC
    def callRemote(self, method, *args, **kwargs):
        def call(m, *a, **kw):
            result = self.service.__getattr__(m)(*a, **kw)
            return result
        d = deferToThread(call, method, *args, **kwargs)
        return d

Can you post a short example (<http://sscce.org/>) that demonstrates

+1.

If possible, I'd very much prefer that we have just the one DVCS mirror instead of one for darcs, one for mercurial, one for git and one for bazaar.

Just a personal opinion, but I'd rather see an official DVCS in
Mercurial or Git. I'm not a real Mercurial user myself but from a
market share point-of-view, there's more folks using those which would
make for a lower barrier to entry for new people getting involved.
Twisted frequently bucks popularity trends, but I'm not sure this in
one case where it would be beneficial.

Hi All,

I'm not a core developer but I thought I'd chime in on this one. In
most cases discussions about version control are really not important
- it's much better just to mandate *some* system, that's hopefully the
best tool for the job, all things considered. I also recognise that
bazaar and launchpad are important parts of the Twisted ecosystem, and
I'm not suggesting Twisted should move away from them at all.

However, when it comes to encouraging code contributions, it's getting
to be more apparent that GitHub is becoming the widely accepted medium
for this. I've been a mercurial man for a while, and would have hoped
bitbucket became a bigger player in this area, but for various reasons
it seems GitHub have "won" (whatever that means). In my daily work -
in the wider field I work in, and in various projects my work and
personal code depend on - more and more GitHub is becoming the primary
home for development of these projects.

Being "forced" into GitHub, I eventually (finally) *got* it - code
contribution is easy, and fun. The "fork, code, issue pull request"
model is fantastic. It's something that can be duplicated elsewhere,
but a process that has been popularized by GitHub. It also has reached
critical mass, and has entered into the minds of most developers I
know as "the" place to put open source and private code on.

For the sake of the encouragement of code contributions, I'd suggest
Twisted establish some sort of official GitHub presence. Twisted has a
great development process, and I realize the Twisted trac site should
be the center of this process. What I also suggest is that someone
(perhaps me, since I'm doing similar things at work), use GitHub's
great API to automate integration with Twisted's trac and Development
Process system. That way, besides setting up a periodic mirror system
off the core svn repo, all development actions could be automated and
unified.

I'm fairly confident that such a system could be implemented - again,
I'd enjoy helping out on this if the core devs think this would be
useful.

Cheers,
Reza

Hi Guys,

Just been going through the twisted.web series JP put together
(http://jcalderone.livejournal.com/tag/sixty%20seconds)...these are
terrific. Turn the bottom one into serving a "Hello World" Resource
and you've got a much simpler Hello World than the Tornado site (not
to start a war on Tornado...their URL dispatch approach is pretty
nice).

Is there is a reason these aren't linked to on the frontpage of
twistedmatrix.com...preferably with the short hello world above it?
They're much more accessible than the Twisted Web tutorials under
docs.

They're linked from the Twisted Web documentation page.  They're 
probably not linked from the front page because no one has taken the 
time to redo the website design in a way that allows direct links to 
this kind of specific documentation.

That was kind of my point... ;) It's pretty buried.  It's not under
docs directly and it's not under the "read this first!" about web
stuff. And yes I'm volunteering to reorg.

There is no PATH variable set when the script is called at system startup. 
So you'll have to use the full path to twisted.

I haven't written an init-script for twistd myself, I just use the one
auto-generated by tap2rpm. You can compare your script to the template
tap2rpm uses and see if that gives you any clues:

    http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk/twisted/scripts/tap2rpm.py#L17    
It surprises me that you say you can tell that the script runs at boot
because you can see it in /var/log/messages - although most Linux
distros hide the boot-script messages by default, they usually provide
a way to display them for debugging purposes such as these (different
distributions use different actions to trigger boot messages; if you
can't find instructions for your distribution online, you might try
hitting Escape a few times at different parts of the boot sequence).

Finally, in my limited experience of diagnosing scripts that work from
an interactive shell but not at boot time, you might want to look for
code that uses environment variables. $EMPLOYER once had some scripts
that got some particular setting from an environment variable that was
only set by interactive shells - so if you ssh'd to the machine and ran
the code, it'd be fine, but it crashed when run at bootup.

CentOS (and perhaps other Linux distributions) has a tool called
/sbin/service. If you run "/sbin/service ghserver start" rather than
"/etc/init.d/ghserver start", /sbin/service will start the service in
a clean, boot-like environment and you might get more debugging clues
that way.

I have written an init.d script thats starts and stops a twistd. You need to create a .tac file and create a daemon. A wee bit more tricky but you can start twistd fine.

Thanks,

My understanding is the twistd will have a default log twistd.log. 
?

Sorry, I mean't to say I will use the full path to twistd (i.e. /usr/bin/twistd) and see if that works.

Thanks for the tips guys,

Maartin, I have a feeling that you may be correct. I'm going to see if I can't set the python path within the script.

Tim, the only reason I can see anything in? /var/logs/messages is because I use the "logger" tool to log those messages directly from the bash shell script. See the script below.

Kind Regards,
Don

Hi guys,

My application is being executed using twistd as per documentation. All is working fine but I need to have the service start automatically at boot time.

So as a test I've created a script in /etc/init.d/ which looks like this:

#! /bin/sh
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:????????? ghserver
# Required-Start:??? $local_fs $remote_fs $network $syslog
# Required-Stop:???? $local_fs $remote_fs $network $syslog
# Default-Start:???? 2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:????? 0 1 6
# Short-Description: Start/stop GHServer server
### END INIT INFO

logger "GHServer: Start script executed"
GH_SERVER_PATH="/home/myname/Python/ghserver"
export PYTHONPATH="$GH_SERVER_PATH:$PYTHONPATH"

case "$1" in
? start)
??? logger "GHServer: Starting"
??? echo "Starting GHServer..."
??? twistd -y "$GH_SERVER_PATH/ghserverapp.py" -l "$GH_SERVER_PATH/ghserver.log" --pidfile "$GH_SERVER_PATH/twistd.pid"
??? ;;
? stop)
??? logger "GHServer: Stopping"
??? echo "Stopping GHServer..."
??? kill `cat $GH_SERVER_PATH/twistd.pid`
??? ;;
? *)
??? logger "GHServer: Invalid usage"
??? echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/ghserver {start|stop}"
??? exit 1
??? ;;
esac

exit 0


This works fine when running /etc/init.d/ghserver start and /etc/init.d/ghserver stop. The script also run when I boot since the logger actually logs the "GHServer: Starting" text to the /var/log/messages file. However, my service actually does not start. There is no pid to be found anywhere, there are no error logs anywhere, just nothing. I might be doing something wrong here but is there someone who's gone through this process and can provide some samples how they did it? Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards,
Don

What does running under trace tell you?

I think Itamar was suggesting that you use "/bin/bash -x" as your init 
script interpreter and examine that output.

It may also make sense to find someone who knows about writing init 
scripts for your platform and ask them some questions.  It seems like 
this is an issue with the environment around twistd, not with twistd 
itself.

Hi Don,

Here's the init.d we use for Twisted on Ubuntu. Sets the full path to Twistd:

Actually, I typoed, and meant /usr/bin/strace, but that's a good idea too :)

Hey Guys,

I apologise in advance but this is is not the correct platform.

Essentially I'm porting my server to a new VPS and the platform is enough to cause
me headaches to resurrect my twisted server.

I'm using open-ssl however I'm seeing mismatches:

[root at 1003100U6H1Z pyOpenSSL-0.9]# python 
Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Sep 30 2008, 15:41:38) 
[GCC 4.3.2 20080917 (Red Hat 4.3.2-4)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import OpenSSL
Traceback (most recent call last):
? File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
? File "/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/OpenSSL/__init__.py", line 11, in <module>
??? import rand, crypto, SSL, tsafe
ImportError: /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/OpenSSL/crypto.so: undefined symbol: PyUnicodeUCS2_Decode

What is this PyUnicodeUCS2_Decode? Has anybody else seen this blighter?

Thanks,
Garyc

When you build Python, you either build its Unicode support with support for UCS2 (2-byte, 16-bit code points) or UCS4 (4-byte, 32-bit code points).  Extension modules must be built in the same configuration as the Python interpreter in order to be loaded and dynamically linked correctly, since UCS4 python is missing the UCS2 symbols and vice versa.

It looks like you have a UCS4 python and a UCS2 PyOpenSSL.  You need to re-build PyOpenSSL against the Python installation that you are using, or at least one built with the same options.

This is a pretty common build problem; if you search for mailing list threads about it on python-list or python-dev you should find plenty.

Good luck,

-glyph

Wow, you really are a glutton for punishment, aren't you? :)

Go ahead and create an alternate front-page wiki page, and let the list know when it's ready so we can pile on and critique.

I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to do better than what's there, though.

Looking forward to it,

Much appreciated Glyph. I thought it would be a common problem.
Just didnt know which group to ask.

I guess I am. :)

Honestly, we've used Twisted in my org for quite some time and until I
was forced to use it my view of it was colored by my infrequent
beatings by it and the derisive comments of the primary maintainer at
that time.

With the 4 hours I spent actually learning the concepts, Twisted is no
longer a black box...it makes sense. That and I've
optimized/re-factored a bunch of code to work with that theory instead
of against it. Huge benefits.

I'd say the biggest barrier to entry is the documentation. And let's
face it...there's no reason Twisted shouldn't be used by more folks.
It's great...but learning it feels like a frat hazing. That's largely
because reading the docs feels like learning from that comp sci prof
who was smart...but wasn't smart enough to explain the concepts at
your level.

Let's take Tornado for a second...right now I'm building a web API for
our services and I'm in platform selection mode. My experience with
Twisted.web's URL dispatching system made me want to cry. Tornado was
a breeze to use. But here's the problem:

1.) There's no good async libraries for Tornado...so if I want to
integrate with Redis or MySQL or anything, I've got to accept that I'm
going to block when it's not necessary and live with that.
2.) Tornado's performance from the the benchmarks I've read is only
between 15% and 30% better than twisted.web.

2 is not enough to justify 1, because let's face it (and yeah I'm
coming to a point) 1 is going to kill your butt often enough to make 2
not matter.

But because I'm pretty comfortable with Twisted now...it makes more
sense for me to write my own dispatcher that emulates Tornado's than
give up all the rock-hard awesome features and reliability of Twisted.
deferToThread may not be the preferred way of handling a blocking
task...but when you need it, you need it.



...so my point is...Twisted's PR problem is it needs more accessible
docs. They need to be understandable, entertaining...and pretty. It
all starts with that front page...and the web app in 10 lines right
smack dab there.

I'm going to start with the front page...and then I'm going to write
some articles on my blog that are what I wanted when I was learning
Twisted. Hopefully, they'll be of use to someone.

My spam filter almost killed you on that phrase.  I think you mean rock-solid.

Cool.  See exarkun's Twisted in 60 Seconds series; maybe fill in the things that are still not clear after that?

I'll post to them to the list and y'all can see if its worthwhile.

The docs really are about to get a whole lot better.  No really, any minute
now.

The Sphinx conversion is not dead!  I've just been busy...

And once that's done I think it'll be a whole lot easier to write and
maintain things, not to mention read the docs.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Getting a synchronous interface to a twisted
	reactor
Message-ID: <y2q7659cab31004211942r3a4a32c4od538f2a2872aaa3d@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to write a dead-simple interface for an IRC client library, like
so:

     import simpleirc

    connection = simpleirc.Connect('irc.freenode.net', 6667)
    channel = connection.join('foo')

    find_command = re.compile(r'google ([a-z]+)').findall

    for msg in channel:
        for t in find_command(msg):
            channel.say("http://google.com/search?q=%s" % t)

Working from the example in the
docs<http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/clients.html#auto5>,
I'm running into trouble with the callbacks (the code is a bit lengthy, so I
pasted it here <https://gist.github.com/e7e13f074a2691de6371>). The problem
is that the call to channel.__next__ needs to be returned when the
callback <IRCClient
instance>.privmsg is called, there doesn't seem to be a clean option of
doing that. I could try to use exceptions or threads, but that seems like
the wrong thing here, is there a simpler (blocking?) way of using a twisted
reactor that would make this possible?

Cheers,
Andrey

This is totally a tangent, and I hope no one feels the need to extend 
this part of this thread any further (unless it's with statistics), and 
I know the point wasn't to start a conversation about the relative 
performance of these two web servers, but I still have to comment.  The 
benchmarks I've seen of Tornado's performance are ambiguous at best, 
misleading at worst.  It's not a good idea to draw any conclusions from 
them.

If it's of any use, someone started trying to do this, and got at least 
as far as deleting all of the front page content:

So about the conversion, I wonder if we can start to generate the Sphinx 
version of the docs on buildbot sometime soon, and perhaps host them 
alongside the current docs, as the first step in phasing out the current 
version?

How automated is the conversion process now?  Are errors reported such 
that people could start looking at them and fixing the issues?  It seems 
like you've done almost all of the hard work, and the rest is dealing 
with some edge cases in lore or restructured text, and that might be 
more easily spread out amongst more people.

Hi Jason,

I was up for revamping the front page until school hit, but in about a month
I'll be back and ready for action and happy to help with this / provide
feedback. You might find this IRC snippet about the front page relevant:

21:27 < jesstess> exarkun: so you're saying "Want an IRC bot? BAM follow
this link. Want a TCP server? BAM follow this link?" for the top 5 things
people try to implement?
21:27 < exarkun> jesstess: something like that, yea
21:28 < jesstess> exarkun: I'd be up for working that up.
21:31 < exarkun> jesstess: It would be awesome if you could work on that.  I
think it will help a lot.
21:32 < exarkun> jesstess: I think it's also important to have the website
direct people quickly and easily to the documentation they need.
21:33 < exarkun> jesstess: There are too many clicks involved now, so they
might not even find a new set of topic-oriented guides.
21:33 < jesstess> exarkun: I'll do it if you give me a list of the top 5
applications people try to write :)
21:33 < exarkun> jesstess: Doing something about that would be another
highly productive task.
21:33 < exarkun> ah, there's the rub.
21:34 < radix> 1. IRC bot that execs python code, 2. caching web proxy
21:34 < radix> 3. XMPP something
21:34 < radix> 4. MMORPG
21:35 < radix> I can't think of a fifth
21:35 < jesstess> does "simple TCP server" really not make the list? That's
why I first used Twisted.
21:35 < thijstriemstra> mimic skype..ish
21:36 < thijstriemstra> chat, streaming, authentication, porn
21:36 < exarkun> jesstess: not sure if it comes in the top five
21:36 < exarkun> probably the top ten though
21:36 < Screwtape> I'd say half the questions in here have something to do
with IRC bots.

Hello Andrey,
May I recommend you to look at Twisted Words? There are plenty of IRC
tools there.

Thanks! The main reason for the question, though, is just curiosity from
playing with and learning the Twisted API, not necessarily getting the
example working :)

A more direct question would have been - is there a Twisted reactor which
provides a blocking call instead of a callback? Is there an accepted "best"
way of wrapping an non-blocking async API with callbacks into a
blocking synchronous one?

You can execute blocking call at any time of your pleasing. It will
predictable block all execution paths. Typical wrapper around blocking calls
is thread. Something like this (from
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/threading.html):

d = threads.deferToThread(yourSyncCall)
d.addCallback(...)

If I understand what you're asking you want to call Twisted code in the 
following style:

def function():
   # this code blocks
   result = some_twisted_thing()
   value = process(result)
   final = morecode(value)

Rather than:

def function():
    def = some_twisted_thing()
    def.addCallback(process)
    def.addCallback(morecode)


If that's the case, then the answer is "sort of" but I think you might 
have misunderstood Twisted a bit. The entire point is to have 
non-blocking APIs, not to want a blocking API.

You can't "really" block, because that stops the reactor from running, 
and thus any networking events being handled.

You can emulate it in Python 2.5 with generators & a special decorator:

from twisted.internet import deferred

@deferred.inlineCallbacks
def function():
    result = yield some_twisted_thing()
    value = yield process(result)
    final = yield morecode(value)

I might have misunderstood what you're asking though, in which case I 
apologise, and can you be more specific?

That sounds like might be the case case. Wwhat I'm looking for, then, is a
way to use the IRCClient protocol outside of Twisted - in a way where I can
use it like:

connection = # something using IRCClient
msg = connection.privmsg() # blocks
assert msg == "andreyf: hello there, lovely IRC users!"


Are there any projects along those lines?

Cheers,
Andrey

I suppose we could do this, if you think it would help.  Note that the
lore2sphinx
script requires Python 2.6 and I think at least Sphinx 0.6.4 (I'm using
0.6.5).

I think the automatic conversion process has reached the point of
diminishing returns.
I've got it down to about 13 warnings in the Sphinx build process, though
there are still
some markup errors in the output.  Trying to make the conversion handle
these seems
to just introduce more errors in other places.

In other words I think it's time to create a branch with the Sphinxified
docs and do a manual review.

I've got a basic transition plan sketched out here:
http://twistedsphinx.funsize.net/transition_plan.html

That's just basically an outline of a plan Glyph and I hashed out during the
Twisted sprint at PyCon.

Ideas and criticisms welcome.

Not that I'm aware of. I'm pretty certain the Twisted protocol 
implementations all require the reactor and thus need to be run in an 
async manner.

There are various hacky ways you could accomplish this; the obvious one 
that springs to mind is running the reactor in a thread. There are 
various caveats to doing this, the main one being you can't call any 
Twisted functions outside the reactor thread except "callFromThread" so 
you'd probably want to write some kind of wrapper; and it's a bit 
counter to the whole ethos.

Given you said:

"""The main reason for the question, though, is just curiosity from 
playing with and learning the Twisted API"""

...I would recommend just trying to use the API in the Twisted "way". 
You can use the aforementioned @inlineCallbacks decorator & generator 
syntax if you prefer writing your code that way, as opposed to 
traditional deferred callback chaining.

Would it be easier to fix these by changing the lore sources?

I seriously doubt it.  In fact I think it would be much more difficult.

Other than the 13 build warnings I mentioned above, almost all of the
rest of the markup errors are things like a missing space character.

Fixing this in the lore sources would require:
1) removing most if not all indentation from all the lore sources
2) making sure every <b>, <i>, <code>, <a> tag (and some others I'm sure)
   have exactly the same spacing before and after them...including tabs,
newlines, etc.
3) revamping lore2sphinx to stop doing all the workarounds it currently does

I think it will be much easier to go through the ReST sources (which IMO
will need to
be done anyway) and add spaces or whatever where needed.

Not the first time we've seen these kinds of benchmarks. Microbenchmarks
rarely give you interesting information about real world apps. Also: ab
ain't a very good HTTP benchmark.

But hey, data points are data points.

Message-ID: <1541138433.551272144614766.JavaMail.rgacote@Raymond-Cotes-MacBook-Pro.local>

Hello Twisted:

An initial release of txriak has been posted to PyPI:
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/txriak/0.1.1>

txriak is a Twisted module for communicating with Basho Technology's Riak data store via the HTTP interface. 
Written in Python, it requires Python 2.5 since it uses the yield version of deferreds.
Initial release was written to match as closely as possible the 0.9 riak.py Python module released by Basho Technologies. 

Hope others find this to be useful. 
Look forward to comments and feedback.

I didn't notice the benchmarks...good catch. I was more interested in
the conciseness or lack thereof with the various frameworks. Very
surprised that Twisted was nearly as clean and easy to read as the
Eventlet example.

This comparison (in the blog post) makes the same mistake that many such 
comparisons make.  The division of libraries into the arbitrary 
categories of "reactor model" and "coroutine" is artificial.

See corotwine for an example of using Twisted and coroutines.  And see 
txwsgi (announced here a week or two ago by Manlio Perillo) for a 
Twisted-based wsgi container which supports applications that look 
almost identical to the eventlet/gevent wsgi applications used in this 
comparison.

And take a look at how eventlet and gevent are implemented, and you'll 
find something that's essentially the same as a Twisted reactor.

It doesn't make sense to use a connection pool for an in-memory SQLite3 
database.  Every time you connect to ":memory:", you get a brand new, 
empty database.

If you want this to work, you need to be able to establish multiple 
connections to the same database.  You could do that by making your own 
DB-API 2.0 module that wraps sqlite3 and always hands back the same 
:memory: connection when its connect function is called.

Hash: SHA1

Hi list,

some months ago, I created an implementation of the OSC protocol [1] in
twisted, together with Alexandre Quessy.

I've put it to review but so far nobody has responded to it:
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4196

As stated in the ticket we'd like to release and maintain this as part
of twisted but we'd also like to release this soon(ish).

So my question is: what are your opinions about including the OSC
protocol as a standard part of twisted and what will be the expected
time frame for such a thing to happen?

The only significative difference, IMHO, is that eventlet and gevent are
able to schedule coroutines directly in the main event loop (since they
have full control over it), while with Twisted and Python applications
embedded in C servers like Nginx, you have to return control to the
"framework" (this what the x-wsgiorg.suspend WSGI extension does).

What does "schedule coroutines directly in the main event loop" mean?

It looks like I misremembered the interface provided by txwsgi.  I 
thought it let you switch to another coroutine directly, rather than 
requiring that you yield an empty string after (the equivalent of) 
setting a flag.  This seems to be more because of WSGI constraints than 
anything else, though.

Hi Arjan,

Just a point of procedure, the ticket is not actually in "review" as the 
Twisted development process understands it.  Tickets with the "review" 
keyword are in review, and receive particular attention.  Other tickets 
easily get lost in the large pile of open tickets.
>As stated in the ticket we'd like to release and maintain this as part
>of twisted but we'd also like to release this soon(ish).

This is mainly a question of when someone finds it interesting enough to 
review the code.  Personally, while I remember commenting on that ticket 
a couple months ago, I had to go re-read the wikipedia page to remember 
what OSC is.  Since this is a protocol I've never come across before and 
which I can't think of any immediate applications that are relevant to 
me, it's not likely I'll spontaneously go review the code.  Perhaps 
there is another developer who would be interested in this who will do 
so.  Posting on the list is a good way to try to get attention, as is 
asking in the Freenode #twisted irc channel.  If you can't find someone 
who wants to review it just because they're interested, you might be 
able to trade for a review of another ticket.

Hope this helps,
Jean-Paul

As a worst case alternative if time becomes an issue, you can release
this as a standalone project (many Twisted libraries have begun
prefixing package names with tx, e.g. txAMPQ). It can always be merged
later with Twisted if there's an interest (as long as the license
doesn't conflict).

Hello,

I have written an introductory article to Twisted, and I would be
delighted to see it published on Linux Weekly News some day.

It is available at: http://jdb.github.com/concurrent.html

Here is the plan in brief:
1. what Twisted is: what "network framework" means,
2. what network concurrency is,
3. why "one socket in one thread" won't get you very far: Twisted is
safer, faster and faster
4. what is the reactor, and how it interfaces with the kernel and the
Twisted Protocols
5. what deferreds are (and how they are actually _not_ directly tied
to the reactor)
6. Finally how to write Twisted code that looks sequential (with recap
on yield and decorators)

What I tried to do:

- write for a developer audience who are not particularly expert in
Python nor kernel internals. Python idioms are explained, and I try to
clear the magic by unfolding the big ideas (this audience actually
maps well my friends and colleagues),

- include short, clear cut code snippets to nail the point,

- short enough to fit in a brain cache but complete and precise enough
so developers come out with an understanding of what is under the
hood,

- make the article "flow", by introducing the plan, connecting
sections, using proper english :/ ,


Any comments welcome, and especially:

- it might be too long and present too many things, maybe I should
split it in parts,

- correctness: I simplified the object model (the article mentions
that the factories are out of scope...), but everything said should
still be correct. Also I sometime take guesses at subject I am not an
expert, with the intent to make a clear message: this is a thin line,

- coherence with the Twisted jargon and existings docs, there may be
terms that I use which should be substituted,

- typos and proper english: I think lwn standards are pretty high for
that matter,

The pdf can't be attached, mailman complains that it is more than 40kB.

The scripts are at http://github.com/jdb/jdb.github.com/tree/sources/concurrent/

The git manip for using your favorite editor on the sources is:
? ?git clone git://github.com/jdb/jdb.github.com.git
? ?git branch --track -b sources origin/sources
? ?vi concurrent.rst

Thanks in advance !

Hi,

I can't install Twisted in VirtualEnv. Can someone explain what is

You need to install the Python development headers.  This is usually in 
a package named "python-dev" or "python-devel" or something like that.

In the related blog post the author describes EvenMachine:  "It looks
like super clean Twisted too me."  Looking at the ruby example in
gist, I'm trying very hard to figure out what's super clean about it.

Using "super clean" and "Ruby" together in the same sentence, in relation to anything more complex than "Hello World", especially on the Twisted list, causes tears in the space-time continuum.  

Please stop before something gets really broken.

I saw a mention of benchmarks, but no numbers... - would be most interested
in seeing those.

And as for EventMachine - I prefer twisted, but if you gotta be in ruby (as
I do increasingly often), it's great.

cheers,

Wow.  This is an incredible, sprawling article :).

I'm glad you wrote it, and I think it introduces quite a bit of material.

I don't really have time to write up a full editorial review, but definitely the strongest impression I got from reading it was this comment which you already made:

> - it might be too long and present too many things, maybe I should split it in parts,

This is really a series of articles; you should expand on each part, one at a time.  It really seems like you're rushing through it in order to cover a lot of ground.

Someone who is deeply committed to learning about Twisted and is planning to spend quite a while reading it would be well-served by your introduction.  However, most people who come to Twisted are actively trying to get something done, and they don't care about the theory too much until they manage to get some basic stuff working.  So you may want to provide some more pointers to tutorials and other practical getting-started guides.

You also focus a bit too much on performance.  While a Twisted server does provide some performance benefits, it's very hard to conclusively measure that one approach is really "faster" than the other; especially since some Twisted idioms (such as the inlineCallbacks example at the bottom of your article) are just as "slow".

There are lots of benchmarks showing various different performance characteristics of multithreaded vs. multiprocess vs. event-driven code, and with modern optimizations in each of these architectures, which of these is really the fastest changes from year to year.  If you were to take some benchmarks of Twisted vs. code using the 'multiprocessing' module, for example, you might get some surprising results (and ones which would vary wildly depending on which platform you were using and what exact algorithms you used in each example).

If you want to focus on performance, you should include benchmarks and measurements which back up your claims.  Personally, I'd focus more on the safety and comprehensibility discussion.  Even in the realm of performance, the issue isn't that Twisted is really *faster*, per se, it's that the structure of the code is easy to understand and modify, and therefore easier to optimize when you know what your bottlenecks really are.  My favorite example of this is "try to write a failing unit test for a race condition in multithreaded code".  In most Twisted applications, you can force the order of execution in your test so that you can verify the race going one way, then the other, but with threads it's very, very tricky (and sometimes not really feasible, or even possible).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] getting "connection per thread" behaviour
Message-ID: <4BD9AA67.8020902@simplistix.co.uk>

Hi All,

I was asking about this on irc but had to leave in a hurry so thought 
I'd mail here...

So, I have a pool of wsgi threads being run by Twisted's wsgi server 
that want to send stomp messages. The stomp client is Twisted-based 
(http://code.google.com/p/broadwick/source/browse/trunk/broadwick/messaging/twistedstomp.py). 
I want to have as few stomp connections as possible, maxing out at one 
per thread.

Bonus complications:

- each wsgi thread has a logical transaction, that needs to marry up 
with the stomp logical transaction, so I can't just have one stomp 
connection per thread

- I don't know how much overhead there is in creating the stomp 
connection, so I'd like to open as few as possible but keep them open 
and re-use them across wsgi requests.

I found:

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/txconnpool

Anyone know how good that is and if it's useful here?

All help gratefully received!

Chris

Subject: [Twisted-Python] XMLRPC server: nested handlers?
Message-ID: <hrcl39$i61$1@dough.gmane.org>

I have an XMLRPC server, currently with two subhandlers.  One of them is 
getting quite large (over 120 "xmlrpc_" methods plus helpers), and I'd 
like to break it up into "sub-subhandlers".

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/web/howto/xmlrpc.html#auto2 
says that you can do this "to arbitrary depths".  It's not quite clear 
how to set this up, however.  Before I start experimenting, I thought 
I'd ask if anyone has done this, and can show a bit of code for it.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Detecting idle connection with perspective broker
Message-ID: <1272622055.3109.41.camel@pcmlevi.cttc.org>

Hi there,
I wrote a small server application with PB but now I have some problem
with client disconnection. When I have a idle connection, the logout
method at server never is called (this method let me have a list of
current logged users) and then client appears always connected to
server.

I can see the same issue with the chatserver example from perspective
broker doc with detached method. 

class ChatRealm:
     implements(portal.IRealm)
     def requestAvatar(self, avatarID, mind, *interfaces):
         assert pb.IPerspective in interfaces
         avatar = User(avatarID)
         avatar.server = self.server
         avatar.attached(mind)
         return pb.IPerspective, avatar, lambda
a=avatar:a.detached(mind)

How can I detect that idle connection clients to call detached method?

Thanks!

A simple solution could be to implement a ping method with client and have
server ping client once every N seconds. At the same time, fire a delayed
call for N+5 seconds. if delayed call is executed first, drop connection.

Hi,

I'm a long term user of twisted with nevow on top mainly using the 
athena part with LivePage and LiveElement for RPC between Python and 
JScript. nevow/athena opens up a whole new world of transparently 
calling from server to browser and vice versa on a permanent connection. 
With a slight change (three lines) a nevow/athena 'permanent connection' 
also survives network outages of up to a minute like the ones 
experienced in mobile 3G networks.

Recently I've combined twisted/nevow with qooxdoo http://www.qooxdoo.org 
allowing injection/removal of widgets including code into a livepage 
thus providing not only a 'real app' but a real desktop user experience 
in a browser.

If you want to have a look at some demos please feel free to hit

http://nqx.thieprojects.ch          minimal nevow/qooxdoo samples
http://telinfo.thieprojects.ch      Swiss telephone book lookup
http://differenzler.thieprojects.ch Minmal Jass cardgame

To see code (use Firebug, JScript is not obfuscated) done starting from 
2006 till recently.

Part of the above mentioned technology was used in a larger card game 
setup for the Swiss National TV providing a multi player game site with 
various games of Jass. Currently around 25k games are played by about 
70k users a day.

http://www.samschtigjass.ch

The 'Einzelspieler-Version' can be played without logging in.

I've also written experimental stuff bridging XMPP and browser with 
nevow/athena, using XMPP/pubsub for real time data exchange, though for 
this I have no public available samples.

This is definitely a plug but after four years of working in the field 
of RIAs it seems to me that nevow/athena is the most advanced of all 
implementations revolving around 'long polling', permanent connections, 
websockets and related technologies. It solves a host of problems which 
you have to tackle when using other technologies.

HTH, Werner

Hello all,

I've subscribed the Launchpad team https://launchpad.net/~twisted-dev
to receive mail about bugs on the "twisted" source package in Ubuntu.

It will add a small amount of email traffic to anyone who's a member
of that team. However, it will let us know about bugs that Ubuntu
users experience that are due to Twisted.

I'll gladly unsubscribe the team if folk complain loudly enough.

Thanks,

Would it be fair to say that when developing code that utilizes
inlineCallbacks, your function is a generator that returns a deferred
whose callback is the coroutine that's yielding?

the method call to put the data into a session for instance?

The protocol instance *is* the session (or, as I would normally say "the 
protocol instance has a one to one relationship with a connection", but 
I think that's what you mean when you say "the session").  You can 
define whichever methods and attributes you want.

It's a regular Python object.  All the regular stuff you know about 
Python objects applies.

It pays to be very very specific about all the different objects and
interactions going on with generators in Python and especially with
inlineCallbacks to avoid confusion.There are a couple of inaccuracies
in this statement, some which I think are just about poor wording and
some which come from misunderstanding.

In Python, there are generator functions and there are generators.
Calling a generator function returns a generator, which has next() and
send() methods. Generators do not return things, though a generator's
next() or send() methods do (I say this because you mentioned a
"generator that returns a deferred").

Also, there's nothing called a "coroutine" that's related to
inlineCallbacks at all, and the word is fraught with ambiguities in
Python, so it's best to just avoid it entirely.

In inlineCallbacks, nobody but the person writing the
inlineCallbacks-using function knows that there's a generator
involved. The person calling your inlineCallbacks-using function can't
see any generators; they just get a Deferred object which fires when
the generator is exhausted. The interesting part is that
inlineCallbacks is the thing responsible for iterating the generator,
not user-code. It is responsible for calling .send() on the generator
object when previously yielded deferreds have fired. The value of the
Deferred returned will be whatever is passed to returnValue in the
inlineCallbacks-using function.

Hi Christopher,

Apologize for the sloppy language. So would this be a better way of putting it?

Assuming a function func_a that has the inlineCallbacks decorator...

If func_a were added as a callback for a deferred (deferred 1), when
func_a was called another deferred would be returned (deferred 2)
which would only fire once func_a had run to the end of the function
and returned.

While func_a is running, every time yield is called, this would
operate similarly to writing a separate callback for the contents of
each of those yield statements and chaining them normally to each
other as callbacks.

That is this:

@defer.inlineCallbacks
def func_a(value):
   num = yield do_something(value)
   num2 = yield do_something_more(num)
   return num2

is equivalent to:

def func_a(value):
    return do_something(value).addCallback(cb_step_1)

def cb_step_1(num):
    return do_something_more(num).addCallback(cb_step_2)

def cb_step_2(num2):
    return num2


Thank you very much for your help in understanding this.  I've always
used a combination of deferreds and callbacks/errbacks to this point.

-J

Hi Steve,

> Have you continued, or do you plan to continue development where it was left off?

Well, it's something I've only be toying with. I can handle all the
specific Twisted fixes I'd like to make:
  - handling lost connections gracefully
  - proper use of twistd and daemonization
  - massive code cleanups

The only problem is that I'm not that knowledgeable about the
Javascript browser hacks they've employed - their Orbited.js is more
than half "magic" to me (probably due to me not having an opportunity
to work on a large js project). It's something that I'd like to get
into, if someone is willing to take the lead on the javascript side.
It could potentially be as simple as slotting in js.io
(http://github.com/mcarter/js.io), which Orbited.js has apparently
become, and which appears to have been the plan for Orbited 0.8.

> They all seem to have gone off to play with node.js instead.

I don't *really* blame them, considering most of the project's merit
lay in the Javascript realm, and node.js is basically a (less
featurful) version of Twisted for Javascript (of course with the added
bonus of using a heavily JITed and optimized Javascript VM).

> Very cool, I hadn't seen that before.

Yes, very neat. Haven't done much with it, but I think it's a real
winner when you're doing something simple like long-polling/
broadcasting from a queue.

Cheers,
Reza

I would very much support you continuing development on Orbited.
In fact, I believe I can help, or already have patches for most of the
above issues you mention.  A lot of this is result of my "Hotdot" project,
"Create realtime webapps using Django + Orbited + Twisted":
http://github.com/clemesha/hotdot

Specifically, see here for Orbited and twistd working together:
http://github.com/clemesha/hotdot/blob/master/server.py

and see the below for patches that improve handling lost connections gracefully:
http://gist.github.com/256582

Finally, it would be awesome if you put up your improvements on Github
(just a suggestion :-),
then I can easily fork and starting adding improvements, and you can
pull and we can move this forward.

-Alex


p.s. I haven't found many issues with the frontend JavaScript code, but if you
have specific issues that you could point out, I'd love to try to help.

I had worked with your hotdot stuff a while ago, and I think I had even sent you some django csrf patches for Django 1.2 compatibility (it was a while ago...)

Back then, I had started on refactoring the one-big-javascript file in Orbited a few months ago but, at the time, was assured that 0.8 was "just around the corner", so I left it alone.

Well...now I have need and, since Athena seems to be tightly tied to Nevow, cometd is itself, websocket is websocket, so I'm looking again.   Since Orbited seems to have gone into "unmaintained mode", I agree, it may just be time for a fork.

Mostly the problems I had with it were the lack of doc, and the all-in-one 2700 line .js file, and the complete lack of unit tests of any type.

The js.io site documentation link says "Sorry, we don't have documentation yet", and the doc directory on github has a powerpoint file and an echo server so I'm not sure that's going to help so much.

Well, if there's interest on reviving Orbited either as itself, or as a new project with some code from Orbited as well as some of Alex's stuff, I'm in.

I've cloned orbited to BitBucket to take up a fork of the project.  

	http://bitbucket.org/ssteinerx/orbited-new/overview/

I really need this for a project and since the old Orbited seems to be abandoned, I'm taking it on.

Contributions gladly accepted.  

If you're interested in working on it, I'll be happy to give you write access.

I've sent an e-mail to CarterMichael at gmail.com to see whether he'll give an official blessing to this fork once we've moved it forward a bit.

Thanks,

S

comment [1]:

The Python FUSE bindings obscure the issue because, unlike the C
libfuse, they assume that your filesystem I/O is blocking, which
severely limits the performance of python-based filesystems.  (You
cannot receive more requests for I/O in your filesystem until the
previous one has been completed with the pyfuse bindings, but you can in
C.)

I guess I'd like to know before I sink too much time into this, if
there's an approach to Fuse/Twisted that would not have this
limitation. This is a bit confused by the fact that there are three
Fuse/Python bindings that I'm aware of: FusePython, FusePy, and S3QL
[2].

If you've already been down this road, it'd be good to hear from you.

So, sitting at the bottom of libfuse is a file descriptor.  The kernel 
asks your process to service some filesystem operation by putting bytes 
into it that your process can read.  Your process services the requests 
by putting bytes into it that the kernel can read.

Each request/response pair is tagged, so there's no requirement that 
requests be responded to in the same order they're received.

A good Twisted-based solution would use the reactor to read and write 
that file descriptor (alongside anything else going on in the process) 
and support Deferreds (or at least asynchronous responses) to allow out- 
of-order responses and concurrent request handling.

I played around with fuse a little bit to implement something like sshfs 
a while ago.  I did _not_ use the approach described above, because it 
was easier to use something from Armin Rigo's sandbox in a thread, 
dispatching request handling into Twisted, to achieve the necessary 
concurrency and so forth.  You can find that code here:

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/sandbox/exarkun/sshfs.py?rev=26941

It's just something I was messing around with.  I'm sure you'll find 
lots of problems with it (I know of at least one).  It might help with 
part of the general idea, though.  To get rid of the use of threads 
(which is a good idea for a real tool), you just need to port Armin's 
parsing code into a Twisted Protocol class and hook it up to a 
FileDescriptor of some sort that reads and writes the fuse fd.

I wrote some code for this a while ago. I don't remember anything
about it, but it might be a reasonable place to start. I put it up at
http://xzrq.net/ignite.tar.gz

It requires sendmsg extension from

	and hash
Message-ID: <9839287.287071270428092489.JavaMail.defaultUser@defaultHost>

Hi all,
   I use FilePasswordDB with a small smtp-server (a very small toy), but when 
I use the hash function the authentication doesn't work.

Here few lines of code:
"""
def _hash(name, clearpsw, hashedpsw):
    # a very simple hash function ?
    return md5.md5(clearpsw).hexdigest()
    # return 'aa'

# doesn't work; password file content is correctly "hashed"
smtpusers = checkers.FilePasswordDB('smtppasswords.txt', caseSensitive=True, 
hash=_hash, cache=True)

# work! in the file the passwords are in plain text
#smtpusers = checkers.FilePasswordDB('smtppasswords.txt', caseSensitive=True, 
cache=True)

mailservice = mail.MailService()
mailservice.setQueue(relaymanager.Queue(QUEUE_PATH))
mailservice.smtpPortal.registerChecker(smtpusers)
smtpserver = mailservice.getESMTPFactory()
application = service.Application("Console SMTP Server")
internet.TCPServer(SMTP_PORT, smtpserver).setServiceParent(application)
"""

The error is:
Failure: twisted.cred.error.UnhandledCredentials: No checker for twisted.cred.
credentials.IUsernameHashedPassword

Obviously FilePasswordDB doesn't provide that credential when there is the 
hash function; why smtp connection is hashed and not in plaintext? How can I 
get it works?

I found a similar question, with no answer:
http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2006-November/014395.html

Can't say for sure without a full example, but it looks like you are
providing an instance of credentials.UsernameHashedPassword to
portal.login when you should be providing a credentials.UsernamePassword
instance.

If you provide a hash function to FilePasswordDB, it only accepts
IUsernamePassword credentials. The hash function is for plaintext
passwords that need to be validated against a hashed password file.

If your passwords are already hashed before they are sent to the server
for authentication, then there is no need for a hash function.
FilePasswordDB will accept either IUsernamePassword or
IUsernameHashedPassword credentials.

The source comments make it a bit clearer:

Subject: [Twisted-Python] data update to multiple clients
Message-ID: <C75176A3-261F-4FE4-8D1E-F2C32AB30D7D@cusack.net.au>

Probably another newbie question but after much effort I am not  
progressing on the following.

I am trying to design a system where I have a microprocessor  
periodically feeding data on a serial connection to a server script. I  
would then like the server script to notify one or more client scripts  
of the changed data across a local network. I have tried a few simple  
tcp server and client script examples which communicate well for a  
single call but do not seem to suit my application which is not client  
event driven. I considered having each client connect to the server  
every ?? seconds to query for new data but there may be a better way.

Can anyone suggest a suitable design approach using twisted? Is there  
any example code available that may be similar.

Chris

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but it's pretty simple. Just have the 
clients connect & stay connected. Keep a list of currently connected 
clients somewhere (see below) and every time you receive data on the 
serial port, write it out to all the clients. For example:

# ack, global variable!
client_list = []

class MyProtocol(Protocol):
   def connectionMade(self):
     client_list.append(self)

   def connectionLost(self, reason):
     if self in client_list:
       client_list.remove(self)

   def notifyClient(self, data):
     # you will probably want some framing here e.g. Netstring, len+data
     self.transport.write(data)

class ServerProto(Protocol):
   def dataReceived(self, data):
     for cli in client_list:
       cli.notifyClient(data)

...or am I misunderstanding you?

First of all, thanks for your answer :-)

Here the full source code:

smtpusers = checkers.FilePasswordDB('smtppasswords.txt', caseSensitive=True,

I want to hash the password on the server; can't I? How I can decide to use a 
simple IUsernamePassword?

however If I don't use the hash function the connection still continue to use 
an IUsernameHashedPassword.
Probably the smtp connection is not made for a plain-text password, isn't it?

This sounds like it may be a FAQ:

Does that answer your question?

It sounds to me like you want the server to support PLAIN auth but still
compare against a hashed password file? The ESMTP factory you are using
only provides CRAM-MD5 auth via credentials.

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk/twisted/mail/protocols.py#L132

CramMD5Credentials implements IUsernameHashedPassword, so it won't work
with a FilePasswordDB checker that has a hash function. This is the
source of your error message.

You can add PLAIN support by adding credentials that provide
IUsernamePassword. The imap4 implementation has one (PLAINCredentials):

...
from twisted.mail import imap4
smtpserver = mailservice.getESMTPFactory()
smtpserver.challengers['PLAIN'] = imap4.PLAINCredentials
application = service.Application("Console SMTP Server")
...

Clients using CRAM-MD5 will still fail with the same error, though. You
could create your own checker which differentiates how it checks based
on the provided credentials interface. You would start by subclassing
FilePasswordDB and override the requestAvatarId method. If the
credentials interface is IUsernameHashedPassword, just skip over the
hash function. Here's an example based on yours:

FilePasswordDB can already check IUsernameHashedPassword credentials as 
long as you construct it without a hash function.

I don't know if there is a particular reason for silencing the errors.
But most classes in basic.py do not emit any log messages (the only
exception is StatefulStringProtocol).

BTW: There is a ticket about NetstringReceiver - you might want to 
add your request there:

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4378

I have been wondering how I could develop a python application which would
make it easy for users of this application to share small amounts of textual
information over the Internet.

The information is not confidential but I would like to ensure that it is
coming from and generated by the application in question using ssl. I want
it to be easy for users of the application to identify and communicate with
other users of the application.

What type of network am I talking about here? I have plenty of programming
experience, but not much network programming experience. Any advice would be
appreciated.

I think you need to define your application functionality a little
more. You could be describing anything from a web app that implements
a pasteboard, to a web service shuffling JSON objects around or
anything in between.

Thanks Jason,

Okay, lets say that two users are using this hypothetical application. Each
user has some files on his/her system that were installed locally (as part
of the installation or from disk or whatever). Lets assume that both users
have the same files for the sake of this discussion. The application stores
some unique identifiers for each of these files. From a high level point of
view I would like the users to be able to send a list of identifiers to
another user of the system over the internet to indicate which documents to
view and in what order. There may also be some additional textual data
involved to represent segues between the files to be viewed.

Being new to network programming I am not sure what the simplest way is to
accomplish the task. The nature of the data being communicated is not
confidential but I would like to be reasonably sure that the data is being
generated and sent from the application and user in question.

How will users identify themselves to others for communication. I would like
a user to be able to tell another user what his "address" is and have that
user be able to enter that address into the application and use it whenever
he wishes to send that particular user a sequence of id's and text to be
parsed by the application.

I suppose the application will be acting as both server and client. Any
thoughts?

Thanks again

Brian

Sounds like a peer-to-peer model and you need to use an SSL factory
for your protocols. The rest...authentication etc is really something
for you to put together.

Hi Brian,

> thoughts?

For the network part you're certainly describing a P2P model. These
applications are essentially text messaging each other various bits of
info. Keep in mind with P2P stuff - it's notoriously hard to be
*really* P2P without having some element of centrality/servers. The
reason is that what seems like simple communication between two
computers on the internet really goes through firewalls and Nats and
cable modems and what not. The internet - or rather the Internet as
its commonly referred to - is really a collection of public hubs
(websites, mail servers, etc.) which users traverse through their
layers of NATs and firewalls to get to. Usually only ports 80 and 443
(HTTP and HTTPS) are open on these NATs and firewalls, hence why you
don't see a proliferation of other random protocols and applications,
besides a handful. Skype or Kazaa are P2P systems that use a hybrid
approach of relaying via central, publicly accessible "supernodes"
which are promoted on the fly.

Anyway, most people take the easy way out and have one or more servers
sitting somewhere that their clients connect to. Not that the P2P
problem isn't fun ;-)

Here's one of many solutions: get one or more publicly available
servers, and stick some XMPP software (twisted.words, Punjab,
ejabberd, whatever). Turn on SSL. Now you have a secure, centralized
communications system.

Another solution, if you want to go down the "real P2P" route, is to start maintaining Divmod Vertex <http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodVertex> - it's a pretty good proof of concept, and solves many of the really hard problems (especially NAT traversal), but it will definitely need to be fixed up if you want to deploy it in a real-world application.

Hello Brian,
You can start with one server and one client on each side.
If privacy is not a concern for your application, you don't need to
encrypt the data over SSL.

The easiest to use is a basic LineReceiver and a line sender. Next,
you can use JSON if you want to send more than text.
Look at the examples !

TIP: The sender might tell the other peer on which port its receiver
is listening.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Seeking advice: Coping with heavy log file loads
Message-ID: <4BBEE6E7.2000905@vultaire.net>

There may not be a clear answer to this problem, and the answer may or
may not be Twisted-specific.  I'm just trying to fish for ideas here.

The server I'm working on suffers from extremely high CPU time spent in
the logging functions.  I'm spending between 30 and 40% of all CPU time
just in twisted.python.log.msg.

Describing the environment:

We use DailyLogFiles for file rotation along with the
PythonLoggingObserver to allow for logLevel support.  (Of course, this
gives us significant overhead from Python's complex logging
architecture; maybe we should drop this...)

On a 1000 request test of this server, we generate 58,274 calls to
t.p.log.msg.  There's room for cleanup, but there's lots of pressure to
keep many of the log calls we have for forensic purposes, so we can only
cut this back so far.

Anyway, does anyone have any ideas for speedups?  Any stories from
experience especially?  Shots in the dark are welcome.  ;-)

A request/log ratio of 1:60 is extreme. I would call that a log
generator ;-)

I think you could try to use a custom light weight log function that
just queues the log messages (FIFO) and bursts them, say every second,
to the log file (e.g. in a thread to use a multicore cpu).

I don't know if this will help you, but why do you need to route
through Python's logging framework for log-level support?

For example, Twisted's SyslogObserver support allows the use of syslog
log levels without involving Python's logging system:

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.syslog.SyslogObserver.html

If Python's logging framework doesn't show up in your profile output as
an appreciable percentage of the time spent in Twisted's logging
framework, I guess you might as well leave it alone - but if it is
contributing, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out a way to work
around it.

Hi.

Does twisted have a Mercurial (git is also fine) mirror?

Unofficial mirror is ok; I just would like to avoid download entire svn
history with hgsvn.

Or:

0. Profile logging system - what exactly is it doing that's using all
that CPU? If you're unlucky, it's just "lots of Python function calls",
but maybe it's fixable.

1. A log function that sends messages (over e.g. a Unix socket) to
another process that does the writing. Python GIL means you don't get
that much benefit from multiple threads.

2. Rewrite log function in C... and then maybe run it in another thread.

Duh. Of course.

BTW. syslog from the syslog module on linux just opens a unix socket
to /dev/log and could be used to do just this. (e.g. with log level
LOG_LOCAL0 and configuring your syslog to log facility local0 to a
specific file)

There is one at github: http://github.com/powdahound/twisted

Hi Paul,

Is is sporadic? (the CPU burst) If so, you may be seeing the log
rotation code kicking...and it's probably blocking your app too until
it completes.

I've got a couple patches to fix the blocking issue:

http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4372

The patch which eliminates old log rotation will probably get rid of
your CPU problem too.

Definitely use syslog.  To see how much logging is costing you without
changing code, you can simply route to /dev/null via syslog.  Btw, w/ local
logging, you may not see it in the cpu usage - more likely in the i/o wait.
 In my experience, logging to a remote syslog-ng server over udp has very
little impact on the app, almost like logging to /dev/null (which in turn is
like not logging at all).

Are you by chance on AWS/EC2 ?  If so, please contact me to discuss possible
design partnership.

Just wanted to respond to the input everyone's given.  Thanks a lot; I'm
glad I asked.

I'll probably look into the syslog route.  I thought about it before,
but I wasn't sure how much flexibility it gives.  Given the suggestions
here, I've since looked into it a little more and it seems to be the
smartest route, especially due to the size of the load.

Thanks everyone!

You might find the logging infrastructure in Foolscap interesting:

 http://foolscap.lothar.com/docs/logging.html

The basic idea is to record log events only in memory, in separate
circular buffers for each priority level. When something "weird"
happens, all the events are bundled into an "Incident File", and then
the incident file is written out (either to disk, or to a gatherer
process over a network). Other tools are then used to reassemble the
pieces of the incident into chronological order and point out where the
gaps are.

I haven't done any specific performance measurements, but I've taken a
busy server and stubbed out the logging calls and didn't see a huge
change in throughput rate. The Foolscap approach gets you useful (and
detailed) information when bad things happen, but throws out most of the
other stuff, so it doesn't touch the disk or make system calls very often.

cheers,

Subject: [Twisted-Python] [ANN] txwsgi 0.1
Message-ID: <4BC22812.7070708@libero.it>

I'm pleased to announce txwsgi, version 0.1.

txwsgi is a fork of twisted.web.wsgi, that, unlike the original
implementation, executes the WSGI application in the main I/O thread.

txwsgi implements the x-wsgiorg.suspend extension (originally proposed
during a discussion on the twisted-web mailing list!), that enables
support to asynchronous WSGI applications that can use Twisted API.

Some examples are available in the doc/examples directory, in the source
distribution.

The project is available on BitBucket:
http://bitbucket.org/mperillo/txwsgi/

More informations are available in the README file.
The x-wsgiorg.suspend extension is specified in doc/wsgiorg.suspend.rst.

Please note that I implemented txwsgi to serve as a reference
implementation.  If someone is interested in using it for non testing
purpose, please let me know since the code needs to be reviewed, some
small issues needs to be fixed and tests must be written.


Regards  Manlio Perillo

Hello everyone,

I'd like to run a python function in a new process, like python 2.6's 
multiprocessing does. I wanted to use ProcessProtocol, but it seems to 
only work for executing executables and interacting with them using 
stdin/stdout/other fds. Is there a way of running a python piece of code 
in a new process?

Thank you,
Gabriel

Well, the only way to run Python code is to run the Python interpreter
in a process and feed it the python code you want to run (using the -c
option).

Hi Reza,

yes, I'd thought of that, but I can't get the function's code, I tried 
the inspect module but
it only works of the code is written to disk; I'd rather not have to 
first write the code to disk just to be able to turn it into a string 
and feed it to python -c. Any ideas on how I could do this?

Thanks,
Gabriel

You don't have to write it to disk - you can use cStringIO.

That's interesting. :) You would write string in a string buffer
that's in the memory, and then... how do you pass it to the child
process? You could not get a pointer to the same location in memory,
as far as I know. You would still need a socket, or something like
that. Am I wrong?

Sticking with "python -c" is probably easiest.

Hi Gabriel,

You might want to try Python's multiprocessing code, it works very
well. I've had pretty good luck using it with Twisted inside the
processes too. The multiprocessing library handles the work of setting
up the send and receive file descriptors.

Sorry, please disregard this - I was thinking about something else.

The way I've done Python process spawning before was to have my code
predefined in a string, and then launched via a ProcessProtocol. You
can do tricks whereby you have your code actually defined in a string,
then you generate your Python source to run tests/etc. on *that*, and
then you send your code-string to python -c when you actually want to
run it in a separate process.

I remember playing around with inspect before, but I gave up at some
point and took the path of least resistance.

Cheers,
Reza

Hi Jason,

yes, I was going to use that but I read in several threads that this 
didn't work correctly in Twisted

IMO Jason probably has a lurking bug that he just hasn't noticed so far.

Same thing with using subprocess instead of the Twisted equivalent
inside a Twisted reactor.  IMX it works 99% of the time.  Murphy's Law
says it'll pass cursory testing and then fail in production.

Haven't had any issues yet. Twisted imports occur inside the process
function. The app was originally written as a purely blocking
multiprocessing app and rewritten to use Twisted inside the
sub-processes. It's passed all automated and hand tests without an
issue. Is there a reason importing Twisted inside sub-process should
not work?

I frequently use a model like this:


#!/usr/bin/python

import sys
# and loads of twisted imports

# function to run in a child process
def work():
     while True:
         cmd = sys.stdin.readline()
         if not cmd:
             break
         # do something
         sys.stdout.write('result\n')
         sys.stdout.flush()

class MyProcessProtocol(protocol.ProcessProtocol):
     def __init__(self):
         self.buffer = ''
         self.queue = []

     def outReceived(self, data):
         self.buffer += data
         while '\n' in self.buffer:
             reply, self.buffer = self.buffer.split('\n', 1)
             d,c = self.queue.pop(0)
             d.callback(reply)

It's pretty simple; you need to be sure that the module does all the 
imports it needs in the child process. You can extend the above model to 
something more complex than simple line-based results, using e.g. JSON 
or python pickle, to handle exceptions, and so forth.

IMHO Twisted REALLY REALLY needs something built-in to do this. I'm 
aware of Ampoule; it didn't work for me when I tried it (which was a 
while ago) and having to define AMP commands to use it was a bit of a 
turn off for me.

I will say importing your reactor (from twisted.internet import
reactor) must be done inside the sub-process or you won't get what you
want.

When I last looked at it, multiprocessing did awful things like fork'ing 
and not re-execing the interpreter in the child process, which seemed 
like an absolute disaster waiting to happen, for many types of objects 
which the child process inherits. Does it still do that?

I guess what you're doing will work though, In that setup, where the 
multiprocessing code is the absolute first thing you call, you're 
essentially using it as a helper to fork off the child process & setup 
the communication pipes (see the example I just posted for a more 
explicit example).

There's the issue that any multiprocess code which writes to the pipes 
(or whatever) used for sending results will block (and block the 
reactor) of course.

Yeah...our code doesn't actually use the pipes. They get fed over AMQP
(txAMQP). We're essentially using multiprocessing as a sub-proc
supervisor to spin-up "processing" engines that consume the AMQP
queues they're configured with.

Here's JP's canonical answer:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1948641/twisted-threading-with-subprocess-popen

I've seen this problem in real code.  We had a PyGTK + Twisted program
that erroneously used subprocess in one place.  2% of the time, it
caused an exception.  98% of the time, it worked fine.  Classic race
condition.  Could be you have a similar bug but it never actually
manifests on your combination of code, OS, and hardware.  Hard to say.

The comment about passing installSignalHandlers=False to reactor.run()
is good to know. Are the signal handlers Twisted installs used by
Twisted for anything besides reactor.spawnProcess() or other tasks
related to sub-process management?

I've noted this in a comment on the stackoverflow answer, but it bears repeating:

This was a long-standing bug in Twisted which has since been fixed on trunk, although it isn't present in a release: <http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/733>.  Starting with the next release (Twisted 10.1, we hope), you should be able to do this without getting this particular type of error.

Still, I wouldn't recommend using the subprocess module in a Twisted application, and multiprocessing even less.  'subprocess' uses select(), which means that if you are running processes in a server handling a large number of connections with a reactor that you've selected for that job, you will occasionally notice that '.communicate()' will blow up because your file descriptors are too big to fit into a select() call.  Its handling of EINTR and EAGAIN are less consistent than spawnProcess, you can't independently handle subprocess termination and subprocess-closing-its-output, so certain types of bugs are much tricker to track down... and I'm sure there are other issues, but I haven't had an opportunity to thoroughly audit it.

Multiprocessing has its own subtly *differently* wonky implementation of subprocess spawning (it uses os.fork(), not the subprocess module), it uses pickle to move objects between processes, and it seems to spawn threads internally, which means it depends on correct thread/process (and hey, maybe thread/pickle too) interaction.

Both of these will work reasonably well for small applications; multiprocessing is *great* if you have a simple, straightforward little multithreaded thing that you want to make multiprocess in order to take advantage of multiple cores.  But by the time you've already taken the trouble to learn how to use Twisted, IMHO spawnProcess is a lot more powerful and a lot less trouble than either of these solutions.  Even more so if you use a higher-level abstraction over it, like ampoule: <https://launchpad.net/ampoule>.

That all makes sense to me if you're using it to coordinate between
the processes using multiprocessing's mechanisms (which I assume most
do). We just aren't. Once the processes are spawned they do their own
thing without any knowledge of each other. There something I should be
expecting to bite me in the rear by folding Twisted into this
architecture?

If you just use Twisted in the subprocesses, that sounds like it
should be fine to me.

If you want a more twisty solution, there's ampoule:

I'm pretty sure Twisted's process.py uses select() in some cases...
possibly on import though, which would be less of an issue, I forget.

If a unix socket exists, you can't listen on it.  Delete /dev/log and 
you should be able to listen on it again.

Yeah, I don't think it's much of an issue.

It does do it on import, and then later as a fallback if that
import-time check found “broken versions of linux” where “write-only
pipe are detected as readable.”  This is apparently Linux < 2.6.11.

I suppose if someone does find it's an issue for them that it wouldn't
be too hard to fix, although perhaps they'd find it easier to simply
upgrade their OS...

Message-ID: <w2jbed370f31004140223v12ae440gaef9452357e3adc1@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need some help in uploading large files to twisted server.
I want to upload large files on twisted server using php.But as php has
limit of 24MB, I decided to use ftp functions of php to upload large files.I
am running ftp server written in twisted.When i try to upload a file using
any ftp client then its working fine but when i use a php script for ftp
file upload then it is not working.Initially when i tried to upload file
using same php script but without passive mode , it created a file on server
but the size of file was 0 bytes.When i added a line to switch to passive
mode now it doesn't go beyond a function to switch passive mode and
connection to server gets timed out.Here is my php code



<?php
> $ftp_server='localhost';
> $ftp_user_name='chetan';
> $ftp_user_pass='chetan';
> $file = 'av.jpg';
> $remote_file = 'av.jpg';
>
> $conn_id = ftp_connect($ftp_server, 8002);
>
> $login_result = ftp_login($conn_id, $ftp_user_name, $ftp_user_pass);

> } else {
>  echo "There was a problem while uploading $file\n";

>
> ftp_close($conn_id);
> ?>

 Or is there any other way i can upload large files on twisted server ?

Hello!

I've tried to profile my twisted server with --profile=path
--profiler=cProfile --savestats options for twistd and it show results
only for functions which are in main thread and it is not really
helpful, because "dirty work" is done in threads. Is it possible to
profile functions which runs in other threads?


Thanks!

twisted.protocols.amp and twisted.spread.pb both implement this.

In a nutshell: in connectionMade, initialize a dictionary on your protocol object mapping request IDs to Deferreds.  When you issue a request, make a new Deferred and put it into that dictionary.  When you receive a response, pop the Deferred out of that dictionary by looking up the key present in the response, and call its .callback() method.

Is that what you were looking for?

Excellent.  Now we just need to bug somebody to change the name to txcronservice :).

I wrote something like this once, I called it txScheduler.  I guess I really
should clean it up and release it.

It's not been heavily tested (and I never got around to writing the unit
tests I had intended to) but it worked for the original use case I had.

If anyone's interested, drop me a line directly and I'll send it to you (MIT
license).

Message-ID: <u2qbed370f31004152124s78b41e02v94d37126012778f@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am trying to use php script on twisted server using twcgi.I want to make
use of http POST method in that.What I want to do is, suppose I am having
one html page say index.html and from that page I want to redirect to other
php page and pass data to that php page using POST method.But I am not able
to access any POST data in php script.When I debugged through
twcgi.CGIScript.render method, I didn't find any reference to POST data.So
how can i make use of POST data in php ?

Thank You.

Hi Laurens: 

I hope to have a repository up next week. 

We're just finishing up initial implementation. 

The Basho folk helped us address a last failing unit test yesterday so our new txRiak now runs the same set of unit tests as the Basho riak.py file. 

I'll announce on this list when it is available. 
Thanks for your interest. 
(looking forward to other eyes reviewing the code)

I keep an unofficial git-svn cloned copy here:
http://ludios.net/mirror/

The tarball includes all of the SVN metadata. To update it, you can:
git svn fetch && git checkout trunk

During a `git svn fetch` or another operation, you may see this error:
error: cannot lock ref 'refs/remotes/ctrl+\\-2371+2123-2'

This is due to a bug somewhere in svn or git-svn; to fix it, you can
recursively grep the .git/ directory and manually delete all references
to the branch. Everything seems to work fine after doing this.

In case anyone is curious, git-svn takes about 26 hours to mirror it,
because it restarts at r1 for several branches. I am told this is due
to the use of SVN partial branches.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] gtk2reactor: scheduling work in the immediate
 future without throttling gtk
Message-ID: <1271589118.3529.18.camel@level.fluendo.lan>

Hi.  My use case is pretty simple:

 - my UI has a throbber that gets activated while I'm querying a CouchDB
server and populating the UI with results, which can be many.
 - when iterating over the results, I want the UI to keep throbbing,
which means the gtk mainloop needs to be regularly scheduled by
gtk2reactor
 - if I iterate over the results and create a deferred chain and fire
it, the whole update of the UI still gets executed synchronously, not
giving the gtk mainloop time to throb.
 - if I do it with callLater(0, ...), again these calls get executed
ASAP and throttle the main loop

Every other workaround I can think of is ugly (using random.random() as
the argument to callLater to space calls, using a counter to space out
calls, doing callLater from the next call chain, ...)

In reality, all I want is to schedule a call to be processed with lower
priority than the main loop; ie, have the reactor run GTK's mainloop
then process my calls.  This way, I could create a chain of say 10 calls
at a time, and give the mainloop time to run between each block.

Is something like this possible at all ? How do the other reactors
handle this ? Why is priority given to the twisted DelayedCalls ?

Thomas

If this is actually affecting your UI this may mean the batch size you
are processing in each call is too big. E.g. if it takes 50ms per call,
you're not going to get more than 20FPS if you run one call per
iteration. 

Something like twisted.internet.task.coiterate might help, but you still
need to make sure each chunk (or rather, size of chunk*num parallel
processes) is sufficiently small.

It'd be great if everyone who wants git access could share a single 
mirror (perhaps this one), to avoid the additional load on our svn 
server that creating a new mirror creates.

The same applies to other vcs mirrors, too, of course.

I don't really understand the question.  You have a lot of stuff going 
on here:

  * HTTP POSTs
  * Redirects
  * CGIScript
  * PHP

Can you try to describe the scenario you're trying to get working step 
by step, carefully separating each of these different pieces?

You may also want to post follow-ups to the twisted-web mailing list 
instead.

Of course, if you made a "sanctioned" mirror in GitHub & BitBucket & LaunchPad owned by the actual project, then all these others could just fade away under the weight of an "official mirror."

That's not to say you couldn't save a ton of time by forking one of the existing ones, but making "One Repo (of each type) to Rule Them All" would be way helpful..even if it doesn't read as well as the original "One Ring..."

I use Powdahound mirror at Gihub. I believe it updates daily. Perhaps,  
we could list it on the website to steer Git folks to it.

Granted we're just talking about DVCS mirrors here...but someday it  
would be really great to be able to send pull requests instead of  
patches for code enhancements. ;)

My aim is to build a server that will support file uploading on server and
uploading is to be done using web browser.So i selected php script for file
upload.
I made a simple html form.

> <html>
> <body>
> <div align="center">
> <br />
> <form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="upload_file.php" method="POST">
>  Please choose a file: <input name="upload_file" type="file" /><br />
>  <input type="submit" value="Upload" />
>  </form> </body>
> </html>
>


Now this file is sent using POST method and then it will redirect to a php
script named upload_file.php.
So to make use of php i used twcgi.PHPScript. When i checked i am not
getting POST data in php code.
Execution calls twcgi.CGIScript.render method internally.When i checked in
this render method, data sent using POST is available in request.args
variable but not sent to php CLI.
Whereas in case of GET method the url is parsed and data sent using GET
method is put in qargs variable and then sent to php CLI.

Since Twisted has an official(?) Bazaar mirror on Launchpad (that I did
not notice before), maybe it is more easy to mirror this repository,
when converting to a different VCS.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Utilizing Twisted for transport w/ SUDS
Message-ID: <q2r4e0e47491004191626p18bc0b4bmc539fb0e90917279@mail.gmail.com>

Hello-

I have a project that is based on Twisted used to
communicate with network devices and I am adding support for a new
vendor (Citrix NetScaler) whose API is SOAP.  Unfortunately the
support for SOAP in Twisted still relies on SOAPpy, which is badly out
of date. In fact as of this email (I just checked), twisted.web.soap
itself hasn't even been updated in 21 months!

I would like to ask if anyone has any experience they would be willing
to share with utilizing Twisted's superb asynchronous transport
functionality with SUDS.  It seems like plugging in a custom Twisted
transport would be a natural fit in SUDS' Client.options.transport, I'm just
having
a hard time wrapping my head around it.

I did come up with a way to call the SOAP method with SUDS
asynchronously by utilizing twisted.internet.threads.deferToThread(),
but this feels like a hack to me.

Here is an example of what I've done, just to give you an idea:

   # netscaler is a module I wrote using suds to interface with NetScaler
SOAP
   # Source: http://bitbucket.org/jathanism/netscaler-api/src
   import netscaler
   import os, sys
   from twisted.internet import reactor, defer, threads

   # netscaler.API is the class that sets up the suds.client.Client object
   host = 'netscaler.local'
   username = password = 'nsroot'
   wsdl_url = 'file://' + os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'NSUserAdmin.wsdl')
   api = netscaler.API(host, username=username, password=password,
wsdl_url=wsdl_url)

   results = []
   errors = []

   def handleResult(result):
       print '\tgot result: %s' % (result,)
       results.append(result)

   def handleError(err):
       sys.stderr.write('\tgot failure: %s' % (err,))
       errors.append(err)

   # this converts the api.login() call to a Twisted thread.
   # api.login() is equivalent to:
   # api.service.login(username=self.username, password=self.password)
   deferred = threads.deferToThread(api.login)
   deferred.addCallbacks(handleResult, handleError)

   reactor.run()

This works as expected and defers return of the api.login() call until
it is complete, instead of blocking.  But as I said, it doesn't feel
right.

Thanks in advance for any help, guidance, feedback, criticism,
insults, or total solutions.

Hi everyone,
Two years ago, I've dropped SUDS to generate and parse the XML by
hand, using xml.dom.minidom.
I don't remember why exactly.
I hope this comment is useful for you. (?!)

I did a similar thing. I wrapped the SUDS client calls into
deferToThread by subclassing suds.Client and adding a method
callMethod which returns a deferred. Here is the code I'm using:
""" Wrapper for suds to create deferred instances. """
from suds.client import Client as SudsClient
from twisted.internet.threads import deferToThread

class Client(SudsClient):

    # method for returning a deferred for the RPC
    def callRemote(self, method, *args, **kwargs):
        def call(m, *a, **kw):
            result = self.service.__getattr__(m)(*a, **kw)
            return result
        d = deferToThread(call, method, *args, **kwargs)
        return d

Can you post a short example (<http://sscce.org/>) that demonstrates 
this?

+1.

If possible, I'd very much prefer that we have just the one DVCS mirror instead of one for darcs, one for mercurial, one for git and one for bazaar.

Just a personal opinion, but I'd rather see an official DVCS in
Mercurial or Git. I'm not a real Mercurial user myself but from a
market share point-of-view, there's more folks using those which would
make for a lower barrier to entry for new people getting involved.
Twisted frequently bucks popularity trends, but I'm not sure this in
one case where it would be beneficial.

Hi All,

I'm not a core developer but I thought I'd chime in on this one. In
most cases discussions about version control are really not important
- it's much better just to mandate *some* system, that's hopefully the
best tool for the job, all things considered. I also recognise that
bazaar and launchpad are important parts of the Twisted ecosystem, and
I'm not suggesting Twisted should move away from them at all.

However, when it comes to encouraging code contributions, it's getting
to be more apparent that GitHub is becoming the widely accepted medium
for this. I've been a mercurial man for a while, and would have hoped
bitbucket became a bigger player in this area, but for various reasons
it seems GitHub have "won" (whatever that means). In my daily work -
in the wider field I work in, and in various projects my work and
personal code depend on - more and more GitHub is becoming the primary
home for development of these projects.

Being "forced" into GitHub, I eventually (finally) *got* it - code
contribution is easy, and fun. The "fork, code, issue pull request"
model is fantastic. It's something that can be duplicated elsewhere,
but a process that has been popularized by GitHub. It also has reached
critical mass, and has entered into the minds of most developers I
know as "the" place to put open source and private code on.

For the sake of the encouragement of code contributions, I'd suggest
Twisted establish some sort of official GitHub presence. Twisted has a
great development process, and I realize the Twisted trac site should
be the center of this process. What I also suggest is that someone
(perhaps me, since I'm doing similar things at work), use GitHub's
great API to automate integration with Twisted's trac and Development
Process system. That way, besides setting up a periodic mirror system
off the core svn repo, all development actions could be automated and
unified.

I'm fairly confident that such a system could be implemented - again,
I'd enjoy helping out on this if the core devs think this would be
useful.

Cheers,
Reza

Hi Guys,

Just been going through the twisted.web series JP put together
(http://jcalderone.livejournal.com/tag/sixty%20seconds)...these are
terrific. Turn the bottom one into serving a "Hello World" Resource
and you've got a much simpler Hello World than the Tornado site (not
to start a war on Tornado...their URL dispatch approach is pretty
nice).

Is there is a reason these aren't linked to on the frontpage of
twistedmatrix.com...preferably with the short hello world above it?
They're much more accessible than the Twisted Web tutorials under
docs.

They're linked from the Twisted Web documentation page.  They're 
probably not linked from the front page because no one has taken the 
time to redo the website design in a way that allows direct links to 
this kind of specific documentation.

That was kind of my point... ;) It's pretty buried.  It's not under
docs directly and it's not under the "read this first!" about web
stuff. And yes I'm volunteering to reorg.

There is no PATH variable set when the script is called at system startup. 
So you'll have to use the full path to twisted.

I haven't written an init-script for twistd myself, I just use the one
auto-generated by tap2rpm. You can compare your script to the template
tap2rpm uses and see if that gives you any clues:

    http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk/twisted/scripts/tap2rpm.py#L17    
It surprises me that you say you can tell that the script runs at boot
because you can see it in /var/log/messages - although most Linux
distros hide the boot-script messages by default, they usually provide
a way to display them for debugging purposes such as these (different
distributions use different actions to trigger boot messages; if you
can't find instructions for your distribution online, you might try
hitting Escape a few times at different parts of the boot sequence).

Finally, in my limited experience of diagnosing scripts that work from
an interactive shell but not at boot time, you might want to look for
code that uses environment variables. $EMPLOYER once had some scripts
that got some particular setting from an environment variable that was
only set by interactive shells - so if you ssh'd to the machine and ran
the code, it'd be fine, but it crashed when run at bootup.

CentOS (and perhaps other Linux distributions) has a tool called
/sbin/service. If you run "/sbin/service ghserver start" rather than
"/etc/init.d/ghserver start", /sbin/service will start the service in
a clean, boot-like environment and you might get more debugging clues
that way.

I have written an init.d script thats starts and stops a twistd. You need to create a .tac file and create a daemon. A wee bit more tricky but you can start twistd fine.

Thanks,

My understanding is the twistd will have a default log twistd.log.

Sorry, I mean't to say I will use the full path to twistd (i.e. /usr/bin/twistd) and see if that works.

Don Schoeman wrote: 
Thanks for the tips guys,

Maartin, I have a feeling that you may be correct. I'm going to see if I can't set the python path within the script.

Tim, the only reason I can see anything in  /var/logs/messages is because I use the "logger" tool to log those messages directly from the bash shell script. See the script below.

Kind Regards,
Don

Hi guys,

My application is being executed using twistd as per documentation. All is working fine but I need to have the service start automatically at boot time.

So as a test I've created a script in /etc/init.d/ which looks like this:

#! /bin/sh
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          ghserver
# Required-Start:    $local_fs $remote_fs $network $syslog
# Required-Stop:     $local_fs $remote_fs $network $syslog
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
# Short-Description: Start/stop GHServer server
### END INIT INFO

logger "GHServer: Start script executed"
GH_SERVER_PATH="/home/myname/Python/ghserver"
export PYTHONPATH="$GH_SERVER_PATH:$PYTHONPATH"

case "$1" in
  start)
    logger "GHServer: Starting"
    echo "Starting GHServer..."
    twistd -y "$GH_SERVER_PATH/ghserverapp.py" -l "$GH_SERVER_PATH/ghserver.log" --pidfile "$GH_SERVER_PATH/twistd.pid"
    ;;
  stop)
    logger "GHServer: Stopping"
    echo "Stopping GHServer..."
    kill `cat $GH_SERVER_PATH/twistd.pid`
    ;;
  *)
    logger "GHServer: Invalid usage"
    echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/ghserver {start|stop}"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

exit 0


This works fine when running /etc/init.d/ghserver start and /etc/init.d/ghserver stop. The script also run when I boot since the logger actually logs the "GHServer: Starting" text to the /var/log/messages file. However, my service actually does not start. There is no pid to be found anywhere, there are no error logs anywhere, just nothing. I might be doing something wrong here but is there someone who's gone through this process and can provide some samples how they did it? Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards,
Don

I think Itamar was suggesting that you use "/bin/bash -x" as your init 
script interpreter and examine that output.

It may also make sense to find someone who knows about writing init 
scripts for your platform and ask them some questions.  It seems like 
this is an issue with the environment around twistd, not with twistd 
itself.

Hi Don,

Here's the init.d we use for Twisted on Ubuntu. Sets the full path to Twistd:

Actually, I typoed, and meant /usr/bin/strace, but that's a good idea too :)

Hey Guys,

I apologise in advance but this is is not the correct platform.

Essentially I'm porting my server to a new VPS and the platform is enough to cause
me headaches to resurrect my twisted server.

I'm using open-ssl however I'm seeing mismatches:

[root at 1003100U6H1Z pyOpenSSL-0.9]# python 
Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Sep 30 2008, 15:41:38) 
[GCC 4.3.2 20080917 (Red Hat 4.3.2-4)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import OpenSSL
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/OpenSSL/__init__.py", line 11, in <module>
    import rand, crypto, SSL, tsafe
ImportError: /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/OpenSSL/crypto.so: undefined symbol: PyUnicodeUCS2_Decode

What is this PyUnicodeUCS2_Decode? Has anybody else seen this blighter?

Thanks,
Garyc

When you build Python, you either build its Unicode support with support for UCS2 (2-byte, 16-bit code points) or UCS4 (4-byte, 32-bit code points).  Extension modules must be built in the same configuration as the Python interpreter in order to be loaded and dynamically linked correctly, since UCS4 python is missing the UCS2 symbols and vice versa.

It looks like you have a UCS4 python and a UCS2 PyOpenSSL.  You need to re-build PyOpenSSL against the Python installation that you are using, or at least one built with the same options.

This is a pretty common build problem; if you search for mailing list threads about it on python-list or python-dev you should find plenty.

Good luck,

-glyph

Go ahead and create an alternate front-page wiki page, and let the list know when it's ready so we can pile on and critique.

I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to do better than what's there, though.

Looking forward to it,

I guess I am. :)

Honestly, we've used Twisted in my org for quite some time and until I
was forced to use it my view of it was colored by my infrequent
beatings by it and the derisive comments of the primary maintainer at
that time.

With the 4 hours I spent actually learning the concepts, Twisted is no
longer a black box...it makes sense. That and I've
optimized/re-factored a bunch of code to work with that theory instead
of against it. Huge benefits.

I'd say the biggest barrier to entry is the documentation. And let's
face it...there's no reason Twisted shouldn't be used by more folks.
It's great...but learning it feels like a frat hazing. That's largely
because reading the docs feels like learning from that comp sci prof
who was smart...but wasn't smart enough to explain the concepts at
your level.

Let's take Tornado for a second...right now I'm building a web API for
our services and I'm in platform selection mode. My experience with
Twisted.web's URL dispatching system made me want to cry. Tornado was
a breeze to use. But here's the problem:

1.) There's no good async libraries for Tornado...so if I want to
integrate with Redis or MySQL or anything, I've got to accept that I'm
going to block when it's not necessary and live with that.
2.) Tornado's performance from the the benchmarks I've read is only
between 15% and 30% better than twisted.web.

2 is not enough to justify 1, because let's face it (and yeah I'm
coming to a point) 1 is going to kill your butt often enough to make 2
not matter.

But because I'm pretty comfortable with Twisted now...it makes more
sense for me to write my own dispatcher that emulates Tornado's than
give up all the rock-hard awesome features and reliability of Twisted.
deferToThread may not be the preferred way of handling a blocking
task...but when you need it, you need it.



...so my point is...Twisted's PR problem is it needs more accessible
docs. They need to be understandable, entertaining...and pretty. It
all starts with that front page...and the web app in 10 lines right
smack dab there.

I'm going to start with the front page...and then I'm going to write
some articles on my blog that are what I wanted when I was learning
Twisted. Hopefully, they'll be of use to someone.

My spam filter almost killed you on that phrase.  I think you mean rock-solid.

Cool.  See exarkun's Twisted in 60 Seconds series; maybe fill in the things that are still not clear after that?

Naw...I meant what I wrote. ;) exarkun's is great...it's web focused.
I'll post to them to the list and y'all can see if its worthwhile.

The docs really are about to get a whole lot better.  No really, any minute
now.

The Sphinx conversion is not dead!  I've just been busy...

And once that's done I think it'll be a whole lot easier to write and
maintain things, not to mention read the docs.

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Getting a synchronous interface to a twisted
	reactor
Message-ID: <y2q7659cab31004211942r3a4a32c4od538f2a2872aaa3d@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to write a dead-simple interface for an IRC client library, like
so:

     import simpleirc

    connection = simpleirc.Connect('irc.freenode.net', 6667)
    channel = connection.join('foo')

    find_command = re.compile(r'google ([a-z]+)').findall

    for msg in channel:
        for t in find_command(msg):
            channel.say("http://google.com/search?q=%s" % t)

Working from the example in the
docs<http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/clients.html#auto5>,
I'm running into trouble with the callbacks (the code is a bit lengthy, so I
pasted it here <https://gist.github.com/e7e13f074a2691de6371>). The problem
is that the call to channel.__next__ needs to be returned when the
callback <IRCClient
instance>.privmsg is called, there doesn't seem to be a clean option of
doing that. I could try to use exceptions or threads, but that seems like
the wrong thing here, is there a simpler (blocking?) way of using a twisted
reactor that would make this possible?

Cheers,
Andrey

This is totally a tangent, and I hope no one feels the need to extend 
this part of this thread any further (unless it's with statistics), and 
I know the point wasn't to start a conversation about the relative 
performance of these two web servers, but I still have to comment.  The 
benchmarks I've seen of Tornado's performance are ambiguous at best, 
misleading at worst.  It's not a good idea to draw any conclusions from 
them.

If it's of any use, someone started trying to do this, and got at least 
as far as deleting all of the front page content:

So about the conversion, I wonder if we can start to generate the Sphinx 
version of the docs on buildbot sometime soon, and perhaps host them 
alongside the current docs, as the first step in phasing out the current 
version?

How automated is the conversion process now?  Are errors reported such 
that people could start looking at them and fixing the issues?  It seems 
like you've done almost all of the hard work, and the rest is dealing 
with some edge cases in lore or restructured text, and that might be 
more easily spread out amongst more people.

Hi Jason,

I was up for revamping the front page until school hit, but in about a month
I'll be back and ready for action and happy to help with this / provide
feedback. You might find this IRC snippet about the front page relevant:

21:27 < jesstess> exarkun: so you're saying "Want an IRC bot? BAM follow
this link. Want a TCP server? BAM follow this link?" for the top 5 things
people try to implement?
21:27 < exarkun> jesstess: something like that, yea
21:28 < jesstess> exarkun: I'd be up for working that up.
21:31 < exarkun> jesstess: It would be awesome if you could work on that.  I
think it will help a lot.
21:32 < exarkun> jesstess: I think it's also important to have the website
direct people quickly and easily to the documentation they need.
21:33 < exarkun> jesstess: There are too many clicks involved now, so they
might not even find a new set of topic-oriented guides.
21:33 < jesstess> exarkun: I'll do it if you give me a list of the top 5
applications people try to write :)
21:33 < exarkun> jesstess: Doing something about that would be another
highly productive task.
21:33 < exarkun> ah, there's the rub.
21:34 < radix> 1. IRC bot that execs python code, 2. caching web proxy
21:34 < radix> 3. XMPP something
21:34 < radix> 4. MMORPG
21:35 < radix> I can't think of a fifth
21:35 < jesstess> does "simple TCP server" really not make the list? That's
why I first used Twisted.
21:35 < thijstriemstra> mimic skype..ish
21:36 < thijstriemstra> chat, streaming, authentication, porn
21:36 < exarkun> jesstess: not sure if it comes in the top five
21:36 < exarkun> probably the top ten though
21:36 < Screwtape> I'd say half the questions in here have something to do
with IRC bots.

Thanks! The main reason for the question, though, is just curiosity from
playing with and learning the Twisted API, not necessarily getting the
example working :)

A more direct question would have been - is there a Twisted reactor which
provides a blocking call instead of a callback? Is there an accepted "best"
way of wrapping an non-blocking async API with callbacks into a
blocking synchronous one?

You can execute blocking call at any time of your pleasing. It will
predictable block all execution paths. Typical wrapper around blocking calls
is thread. Something like this (from
http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/threading.html):

d = threads.deferToThread(yourSyncCall)
d.addCallback(...)

If I understand what you're asking you want to call Twisted code in the 
following style:

def function():
   # this code blocks
   result = some_twisted_thing()
   value = process(result)
   final = morecode(value)

Rather than:

def function():
    def = some_twisted_thing()
    def.addCallback(process)
    def.addCallback(morecode)


If that's the case, then the answer is "sort of" but I think you might 
have misunderstood Twisted a bit. The entire point is to have 
non-blocking APIs, not to want a blocking API.

You can't "really" block, because that stops the reactor from running, 
and thus any networking events being handled.

You can emulate it in Python 2.5 with generators & a special decorator:

from twisted.internet import deferred

@deferred.inlineCallbacks
def function():
    result = yield some_twisted_thing()
    value = yield process(result)
    final = yield morecode(value)

I might have misunderstood what you're asking though, in which case I 
apologise, and can you be more specific?

That sounds like might be the case case. Wwhat I'm looking for, then, is a
way to use the IRCClient protocol outside of Twisted - in a way where I can
use it like:

connection = # something using IRCClient
msg = connection.privmsg() # blocks
assert msg == "andreyf: hello there, lovely IRC users!"


Are there any projects along those lines?

Cheers,
Andrey

I suppose we could do this, if you think it would help.  Note that the
lore2sphinx
script requires Python 2.6 and I think at least Sphinx 0.6.4 (I'm using
0.6.5).

I think the automatic conversion process has reached the point of
diminishing returns.
I've got it down to about 13 warnings in the Sphinx build process, though
there are still
some markup errors in the output.  Trying to make the conversion handle
these seems
to just introduce more errors in other places.

In other words I think it's time to create a branch with the Sphinxified
docs and do a manual review.

I've got a basic transition plan sketched out here:
http://twistedsphinx.funsize.net/transition_plan.html

That's just basically an outline of a plan Glyph and I hashed out during the
Twisted sprint at PyCon.

Ideas and criticisms welcome.

Not that I'm aware of. I'm pretty certain the Twisted protocol 
implementations all require the reactor and thus need to be run in an 
async manner.

There are various hacky ways you could accomplish this; the obvious one 
that springs to mind is running the reactor in a thread. There are 
various caveats to doing this, the main one being you can't call any 
Twisted functions outside the reactor thread except "callFromThread" so 
you'd probably want to write some kind of wrapper; and it's a bit 
counter to the whole ethos.

Given you said:

"""The main reason for the question, though, is just curiosity from 
playing with and learning the Twisted API"""

...I would recommend just trying to use the API in the Twisted "way". 
You can use the aforementioned @inlineCallbacks decorator & generator 
syntax if you prefer writing your code that way, as opposed to 
traditional deferred callback chaining.

Would it be easier to fix these by changing the lore sources?

I seriously doubt it.  In fact I think it would be much more difficult.

Other than the 13 build warnings I mentioned above, almost all of the
rest of the markup errors are things like a missing space character.

Fixing this in the lore sources would require:
1) removing most if not all indentation from all the lore sources
2) making sure every <b>, <i>, <code>, <a> tag (and some others I'm sure)
   have exactly the same spacing before and after them...including tabs,
newlines, etc.
3) revamping lore2sphinx to stop doing all the workarounds it currently does

I think it will be much easier to go through the ReST sources (which IMO
will need to
be done anyway) and add spaces or whatever where needed.

Not the first time we've seen these kinds of benchmarks. Microbenchmarks
rarely give you interesting information about real world apps. Also: ab
ain't a very good HTTP benchmark.

But hey, data points are data points.

Message-ID: <1541138433.551272144614766.JavaMail.rgacote@Raymond-Cotes-MacBook-Pro.local>

Hello Twisted:

An initial release of txriak has been posted to PyPI:
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/txriak/0.1.1>

txriak is a Twisted module for communicating with Basho Technology's Riak data store via the HTTP interface. 
Written in Python, it requires Python 2.5 since it uses the yield version of deferreds.
Initial release was written to match as closely as possible the 0.9 riak.py Python module released by Basho Technologies. 

Hope others find this to be useful. 
Look forward to comments and feedback.

I didn't notice the benchmarks...good catch. I was more interested in
the conciseness or lack thereof with the various frameworks. Very
surprised that Twisted was nearly as clean and easy to read as the
Eventlet example.

This comparison (in the blog post) makes the same mistake that many such 
comparisons make.  The division of libraries into the arbitrary 
categories of "reactor model" and "coroutine" is artificial.

See corotwine for an example of using Twisted and coroutines.  And see 
txwsgi (announced here a week or two ago by Manlio Perillo) for a 
Twisted-based wsgi container which supports applications that look 
almost identical to the eventlet/gevent wsgi applications used in this 
comparison.

And take a look at how eventlet and gevent are implemented, and you'll 
find something that's essentially the same as a Twisted reactor.

It doesn't make sense to use a connection pool for an in-memory SQLite3 
database.  Every time you connect to ":memory:", you get a brand new, 
empty database.

If you want this to work, you need to be able to establish multiple 
connections to the same database.  You could do that by making your own 
DB-API 2.0 module that wraps sqlite3 and always hands back the same 
:memory: connection when its connect function is called.

Hi list,

some months ago, I created an implementation of the OSC protocol [1] in
twisted, together with Alexandre Quessy.

I've put it to review but so far nobody has responded to it:
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4196

As stated in the ticket we'd like to release and maintain this as part
of twisted but we'd also like to release this soon(ish).

So my question is: what are your opinions about including the OSC
protocol as a standard part of twisted and what will be the expected
time frame for such a thing to happen?

The only significative difference, IMHO, is that eventlet and gevent are
able to schedule coroutines directly in the main event loop (since they
have full control over it), while with Twisted and Python applications
embedded in C servers like Nginx, you have to return control to the
"framework" (this what the x-wsgiorg.suspend WSGI extension does).

What does "schedule coroutines directly in the main event loop" mean?

It looks like I misremembered the interface provided by txwsgi.  I 
thought it let you switch to another coroutine directly, rather than 
requiring that you yield an empty string after (the equivalent of) 
setting a flag.  This seems to be more because of WSGI constraints than 
anything else, though.

Hi Arjan,

Just a point of procedure, the ticket is not actually in "review" as the 
Twisted development process understands it.  Tickets with the "review" 
keyword are in review, and receive particular attention.  Other tickets 
easily get lost in the large pile of open tickets.
>As stated in the ticket we'd like to release and maintain this as part
>of twisted but we'd also like to release this soon(ish).
>

This is mainly a question of when someone finds it interesting enough to 
review the code.  Personally, while I remember commenting on that ticket 
a couple months ago, I had to go re-read the wikipedia page to remember 
what OSC is.  Since this is a protocol I've never come across before and 
which I can't think of any immediate applications that are relevant to 
me, it's not likely I'll spontaneously go review the code.  Perhaps 
there is another developer who would be interested in this who will do 
so.  Posting on the list is a good way to try to get attention, as is 
asking in the Freenode #twisted irc channel.  If you can't find someone 
who wants to review it just because they're interested, you might be 
able to trade for a review of another ticket.

Hope this helps,

>From the gevent intro.rst:

Unlike other network libraries and similar to eventlet, gevent starts
the event loop implicitly in a dedicated greenlet. There's no
``reactor`` that you must ``run()`` or ``dispatch()`` function to call.
When a function from gevent API wants to block, it obtains the
:class:`Hub` - a greenlet that runs the event loop - and switches to it.
If there's no :class:`Hub` instance yet, one is created on the fly.

Not sure if you can say that "coroutines are scheduled directly in the
main loop".

No, since this would not be possible with a WSGI implementation embedded
in Nginx.

You *need* to return control to the event loop (process cycle in Nginx).

As a worst case alternative if time becomes an issue, you can release
this as a standalone project (many Twisted libraries have begun
prefixing package names with tx, e.g. txAMPQ). It can always be merged
later with Twisted if there's an interest (as long as the license
doesn't conflict).

Hello,

I have written an introductory article to Twisted, and I would be
delighted to see it published on Linux Weekly News some day.

It is available at: http://jdb.github.com/concurrent.html

Here is the plan in brief:
1. what Twisted is: what "network framework" means,
2. what network concurrency is,
3. why "one socket in one thread" won't get you very far: Twisted is
safer, faster and faster
4. what is the reactor, and how it interfaces with the kernel and the
Twisted Protocols
5. what deferreds are (and how they are actually _not_ directly tied
to the reactor)
6. Finally how to write Twisted code that looks sequential (with recap
on yield and decorators)

What I tried to do:

- write for a developer audience who are not particularly expert in
Python nor kernel internals. Python idioms are explained, and I try to
clear the magic by unfolding the big ideas (this audience actually
maps well my friends and colleagues),

- include short, clear cut code snippets to nail the point,

- short enough to fit in a brain cache but complete and precise enough
so developers come out with an understanding of what is under the
hood,

- make the article "flow", by introducing the plan, connecting
sections, using proper english :/ ,


Any comments welcome, and especially:

- it might be too long and present too many things, maybe I should
split it in parts,

- correctness: I simplified the object model (the article mentions
that the factories are out of scope...), but everything said should
still be correct. Also I sometime take guesses at subject I am not an
expert, with the intent to make a clear message: this is a thin line,

- coherence with the Twisted jargon and existings docs, there may be
terms that I use which should be substituted,

- typos and proper english: I think lwn standards are pretty high for
that matter,

The pdf can't be attached, mailman complains that it is more than 40kB.

The scripts are at http://github.com/jdb/jdb.github.com/tree/sources/concurrent/

The git manip for using your favorite editor on the sources is:
   git clone git://github.com/jdb/jdb.github.com.git
   git branch --track -b sources origin/sources
   vi concurrent.rst

Thanks in advance !

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to install the Python development headers.  This is usually in 
a package named "python-dev" or "python-devel" or something like that.

In the related blog post the author describes EvenMachine:  "It looks
like super clean Twisted too me."  Looking at the ruby example in
gist, I'm trying very hard to figure out what's super clean about it.

Using "super clean" and "Ruby" together in the same sentence, in relation to anything more complex than "Hello World", especially on the Twisted list, causes tears in the space-time continuum.  

Please stop before something gets really broken.

I saw a mention of benchmarks, but no numbers... - would be most interested
in seeing those.

And as for EventMachine - I prefer twisted, but if you gotta be in ruby (as
I do increasingly often), it's great.

cheers,

Wow.  This is an incredible, sprawling article :).

I'm glad you wrote it, and I think it introduces quite a bit of material.

I don't really have time to write up a full editorial review, but definitely the strongest impression I got from reading it was this comment which you already made:

> - it might be too long and present too many things, maybe I should split it in parts,

This is really a series of articles; you should expand on each part, one at a time.  It really seems like you're rushing through it in order to cover a lot of ground.

Someone who is deeply committed to learning about Twisted and is planning to spend quite a while reading it would be well-served by your introduction.  However, most people who come to Twisted are actively trying to get something done, and they don't care about the theory too much until they manage to get some basic stuff working.  So you may want to provide some more pointers to tutorials and other practical getting-started guides.

You also focus a bit too much on performance.  While a Twisted server does provide some performance benefits, it's very hard to conclusively measure that one approach is really "faster" than the other; especially since some Twisted idioms (such as the inlineCallbacks example at the bottom of your article) are just as "slow".

There are lots of benchmarks showing various different performance characteristics of multithreaded vs. multiprocess vs. event-driven code, and with modern optimizations in each of these architectures, which of these is really the fastest changes from year to year.  If you were to take some benchmarks of Twisted vs. code using the 'multiprocessing' module, for example, you might get some surprising results (and ones which would vary wildly depending on which platform you were using and what exact algorithms you used in each example).

If you want to focus on performance, you should include benchmarks and measurements which back up your claims.  Personally, I'd focus more on the safety and comprehensibility discussion.  Even in the realm of performance, the issue isn't that Twisted is really *faster*, per se, it's that the structure of the code is easy to understand and modify, and therefore easier to optimize when you know what your bottlenecks really are.  My favorite example of this is "try to write a failing unit test for a race condition in multithreaded code".  In most Twisted applications, you can force the order of execution in your test so that you can verify the race going one way, then the other, but with threads it's very, very tricky (and sometimes not really feasible, or even possible).

Subject: [Twisted-Python] getting "connection per thread" behaviour
Message-ID: <4BD9AA67.8020902@simplistix.co.uk>

Hi All,

I was asking about this on irc but had to leave in a hurry so thought 
I'd mail here...

So, I have a pool of wsgi threads being run by Twisted's wsgi server 
that want to send stomp messages. The stomp client is Twisted-based 
(http://code.google.com/p/broadwick/source/browse/trunk/broadwick/messaging/twistedstomp.py). 
I want to have as few stomp connections as possible, maxing out at one 
per thread.

Bonus complications:

- each wsgi thread has a logical transaction, that needs to marry up 
with the stomp logical transaction, so I can't just have one stomp 
connection per thread

- I don't know how much overhead there is in creating the stomp 
connection, so I'd like to open as few as possible but keep them open 
and re-use them across wsgi requests.

I found:

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/txconnpool

Anyone know how good that is and if it's useful here?

All help gratefully received!

Chris

Subject: [Twisted-Python] XMLRPC server: nested handlers?
Message-ID: <hrcl39$i61$1@dough.gmane.org>

I have an XMLRPC server, currently with two subhandlers.  One of them is 
getting quite large (over 120 "xmlrpc_" methods plus helpers), and I'd 
like to break it up into "sub-subhandlers".

http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/web/howto/xmlrpc.html#auto2 
says that you can do this "to arbitrary depths".  It's not quite clear 
how to set this up, however.  Before I start experimenting, I thought 
I'd ask if anyone has done this, and can show a bit of code for it.

TIA,

Subject: [Twisted-Python] Detecting idle connection with perspective broker
Message-ID: <1272622055.3109.41.camel@pcmlevi.cttc.org>

Hi there,
I wrote a small server application with PB but now I have some problem
with client disconnection. When I have a idle connection, the logout
method at server never is called (this method let me have a list of
current logged users) and then client appears always connected to
server.

I can see the same issue with the chatserver example from perspective
broker doc with detached method. 

class ChatRealm:
     implements(portal.IRealm)
     def requestAvatar(self, avatarID, mind, *interfaces):
         assert pb.IPerspective in interfaces
         avatar = User(avatarID)
         avatar.server = self.server
         avatar.attached(mind)
         return pb.IPerspective, avatar, lambda
a=avatar:a.detached(mind)

How can I detect that idle connection clients to call detached method?

Thanks!

A simple solution could be to implement a ping method with client and have
server ping client once every N seconds. At the same time, fire a delayed
call for N+5 seconds. if delayed call is executed first, drop connection.
