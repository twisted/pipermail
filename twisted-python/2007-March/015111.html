</I>Actually, would meet our client's needs well enough.  SNMPv3 isn't a 
requirement, just a small nicety for them.

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Looking over your code it seems like it would be fairly easy to make it 
an option in TwistedSNMP.  Currently TwistedSNMP has an abstraction 
point that allows regular or speed-enhanced PySNMP to be used.  By the 
look of it a very simple wrapper module would let libsnmp provide the 
(small set of) features we use (basically just encode/decode and 
translation of result values to/from Pythonic values with a few &quot;type&quot; 
operations as well (OID, EndOfMibView, that kind of thing)).

BTW, I notice that none of your code uses GetBulk (though you define 
it)?  Bulk operations were a *huge* speed win for our application.  
Hopefully you're doing it in your real-world code.

Anyway, I'll see if there's any interest from the customer in trying out 
libsnmp with the code-base.  That would let me take company time to work 
on integrating it into TwistedSNMP.  They almost certainly don't care 
enough to have it do v3 operations, but raw speed on v2 operations is 
something they may care about enough to pay for a few hours of work.

Have fun,
Mike
