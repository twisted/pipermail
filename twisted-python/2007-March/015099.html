The performance of PySNMP (many years ago) was the main reason we wrote
libsnmp; PySNMP seemed to have been written from a very CompSci
perspective with full abstract ASN.1 model that gets subclassed to SNMP
via many steps, all of which slow it down. We went for a more
engineering approach, hardcoding lookup tables for values that never
change for the specific ASN.1 instanciation that is SNMP, for example.

libsnmp isn't integrated into twisted, though we do use it with twisted
with great success in seafelt; there has been some interest in
integrating libsnmp with twisted in recent times. libsnmp also lacks
SNMPv3 support, only because we haven't had a need to add it yet, but
this means it probably doesn't meet your needs.

However, I am interested in both of these goals: twisted integration,
and SNMPv3 support, so perhaps if there enough people interested in such
an outcome we could work together to achieve it?
