</I>PySNMP 4.x was, the last time I looked at it (probably more than a year 
ago, now), *far* too slow for our client's purposes (monitoring 10,000+ 
cable modems).  In fact, even PySNMP 3.x was too slow (even with our 
speed enhanced version).  We *needed* to be able to scale up to well 
beyond 40,000+ cable modems per (reasonable) scanning box to have a 
chance in the market where DSLAMs/CMTSs have that number of modems on a 
single chasis (and 100s of thousands per head end).  As a result, we had 
to defer on the product's biggest potential market.

SNMPv3 is not supported with TwistedSNMP.  We hacked in PySNMP 4.x, 
discovered it just couldn't be used for our purposes and dropped the 
porting effort before it was completed (which would have included the 
SNMPv3 interfaces).

As for the roadmap, I'm not currently working on the project as we 
aren't working on the product that was footing the bill any more. I 
believe Zenoss is using the package to monitor (smaller) networks, so 
they may have some requirements they need and decide to contribute or 
pay for.  There are others using it for small installations as well, 
they may be interested in working as well.  If there are people who want 
to work on the project I'm certainly willing to add them to the 
developer list on SourceForge.

HTH,
Mike
