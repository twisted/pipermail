I agree. Premature optimisation is the root of all evil. I've done some
really dumb things trying to optimise too early, though I thought I was
being really clever at the time. If you're not sure how you're going to
do things, write a prototype first, then rewrite from scratch using
everything you learn from the prototype. You end up with better code in
the end, and it's faster and easier than trying to gradually migrate
old, poorly written code, in my experience.
