Hi, Alec!  Nice to hear that you're using Twisted in such a demanding 
situation.
&gt;<i>Where should we expect a better performance: on Woodcrest 5140 with

I'm only replying to this message because of your extremely short 
timeframe.  I have _no_ reliable data that I would feel comfortable 
making a decision based on, but then, either of these systems will 
likely be adequate to your purposes.  So, take all this with a grain of 
salt, and I hope you get something better.

My new MacBook - a core 2 duo with 4MB of cache - slightly (10% time 
difference) outstrips my desktop work machine - an opteron64 with 1MB of 
cache - when running the Twisted unit tests.  The Opteron is almost 8 
months old now, but the MacBook is a laptop.  I am being intentionally 
vague about the rest of the specs here to stress the anecdotal and 
unscientific nature of this knowledge :-).

However, this result doesn't surprise me, and I guess it may generalize 
to the current generation of hardware, which is to say, Intel wins.  RAM 
is important, as is raw CPU speed, but L2 cache is _the_ major 
determinant of Python's performance in all of the cross-machine 
profiling I've done.  That is to say, this experiment, and this one 
other time I think I ran some stuff on a PowerPC or a MIPS or something 
(those are different, right?).

Good luck on making the right choice here with such tight constraints!
