<PRE>Hi Jean-Paul,

Thanks for your response.

Yes, that's the way I have started doing it, basing it on what I have  
seen in various modules and sub-classing ClientFactory and  
LineReceiver. I am a little confused as to how, when the Deferred is  
returned from the factory, the callbacks that are defined are  
connected to the originating client request. I assume that all I have  
to do is to write the response to the client from the callback and  
that's it.

I guess what I am asking is, if an HTTP request (serviced using  
twisted.web.soap and twistd) starts an asynchronous operation, how  
does it know that it should wait for an event from the operation  
before completing its response.

&gt;&gt;<i> As an aside, is it possible to compile platform specific python

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> required?) mean the memory consumption is prohibitive?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Generally the only thing that's possible is to wrap up the whole  
</I>&gt;<i> application
</I>&gt;<i> with the whole interpreter and some subset of the standard library  
</I>&gt;<i> in an
</I>&gt;<i> executable.  This doesn't sound much like what you're after, though.
</I>
Yes, that's what I thought, although I wondered whether someone might  
have written a wonderful tool :)

Thanks again for your time,

Matt
