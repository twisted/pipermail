</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it's totally out of date.  We should probably just delete the page.

Removed content and placed a link to WindowsBuilds.

&gt;<i> I think that latest Visual Studio license is free to use for open

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is true.  Unfortunately this is not adequate for a Twisted build

</I>&gt;<i> Python 2.7 was built against Visual Studio 2008, which means you need a copy

</I>&gt;<i> buildbot (especially since we may need to be responsible for automated
</I>&gt;<i> builds of pypiwin32 itself) we still need full developer tools and not just
</I>&gt;<i> the restricted free stuff.
</I>
Thanks for the info,
Maybe it should go as an update to
<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/WindowsBuilds#OFFICIAL">http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/WindowsBuilds#OFFICIAL</A>

Looks like current wiki page is out of date.. it talks about python 2.4 and 2.5

I have in plan to build Twisted from scratch for Windows so I can
validate the wiki page and maybe update it.

&gt;<i> My project/company can donate virtual machines. We will host them and
</I>&gt;<i> our sysadmin will take care of their uptime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would you be able to provide external administrative access so that members
</I>&gt;<i> of the project can access and maintain it as necessary?  We have had a
</I>&gt;<i> recurring problem with donated hosting resources, even those with overall
</I>&gt;<i> very good uptime, being inaccessible at critical times, such as sprints.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have a Proliant G5 2xQuad Core Xeon server which is idle at our UK
</I>&gt;<i> office. It has UPS and dedicated RAID batteries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is that machine running a hypervisor or host OS we could have access to?
</I>&gt;<i> More donated hardware frees up our existing donated hardware and cloud
</I>&gt;<i> resources to run other things :).
</I>
For now, we can only provide root access to the VMs and not to the
VirtualBox host.

&gt;<i> We have donated 2 Linux VMs in the past but they were never used, so
</I>&gt;<i> we have stop them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Really, the most serious problem we have is a lack of administrative /
</I>&gt;<i> operational resources, less so than hardware.  Don't get me wrong, hardware
</I>&gt;<i> is useful!  But a couple of hours of a sysadmin's time every month would be
</I>&gt;<i> even more so, because that would let us actually use all the servers that
</I>&gt;<i> folks have offered :).
</I>
I understand and I am fully aware of the effort required to maintain
the infrastructure.
I can help with the buildbot as I maintain a multi-OS / multi-project
buildbot installation
for my project with more than 20 slaves and lot of builders on each slave.


Cheers,
