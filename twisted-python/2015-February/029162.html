I am not a supporter of private discussions for public projects... but
I am ok with having something.
I agree that Twisted general discussion
Open source contributors should take a rejection as an opportunity to improve.
Open source maintainer should not accept patches or add new
contributors just to be nice.

I would say that we should ask for 5 patches which were merged.
I find that 2 patches are too few.
Also 2 patches for cleanup jobs are fine, but I don't think that they
are enough.

&gt;<i> As with the other parts of our process, if there is at least one sponsor,
</I>&gt;<i> and no objections from anyone on the committee within 7 days, any member of
</I>&gt;<i> the committee may add the committer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> New committers should then be announced on the mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not really an ideal process - particularly, it lacks a good way to

</I>&gt;<i> at least.  If there is general assent that this is an improvement, I'll go
</I>&gt;<i> make a wiki page and a mailing list.
</I>
Should be a start and much better than current process.

As soon as the committee is in place I will apply for commit rights to
practice the process and also validate that I deserve the commit
right.
Meanwhile I will start recording my activity.

For new contributors, I suggest that they can create a wiki page to
keep track of the tickets.

I have no idea how you can use Trac report to give you a list of
tickets you have reviewer or you have contributed patches to.

------

Since some Twisted related project are on GitHub it would be nice to
discuss some direction about how to get edit rights for those
projects.

Thanks!
