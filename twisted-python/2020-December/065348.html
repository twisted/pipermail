<PRE>Hi Adi,

The best next step would be to reach out to Conservancy directly—probably Karen Sandler, based on what the website says now—and describe the situation we are in. The problem is that the process we currently have in place is that the old committee nominates the new one and as far as I’m aware it doesn’t support any other options. The folks at the conservancy are probably the only ones who can change this.

The plans you propose all sound pretty reasonable to me, I just don’t have the time or energy to do all the planning and coordinating required to make them happen.

If you did have a fully fleshed out, written up proposal for what to do next, volunteers ready to be the next PLC, and all we needed was a PLC up-or-down vote, I might be able to help by tracking down a majority of the existing PLC and needling them to vote just once; however a better solution would be to get a more sustainable process in place with the SFC that takes this situation into account.

I am extremely enthusiastic for your future reign on a new and improved project leadership committee :-). Thank you for working on this!

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Based on a comment from Glyph
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The current &quot;project leadership committee&quot; is more than half made up of people who are a. no longer affiliated with the project and b. never answer their email at this point,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I started this discussion to see if we can update / refresh the project leadership committee.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I remember that in 2015 I read the same comment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Glypy, do you know the required number of members for the committee?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion is to try to arrange for a committee that is updated every 2 years... or maybe every year.
</I>&gt;<i> I can organize the communication and project management stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is the list of committers for the last to years
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/graphs/contributors?from=2018-12-16&amp;to=2020-12-16&amp;type=c">https://github.com/twisted/twisted/graphs/contributors?from=2018-12-16&amp;to=2020-12-16&amp;type=c</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a quantitative approach... and does not imply quality or dedication, but I think that is a good starting point for searching for candidates for the committee.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can also volunteer to be part of the committee.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we can create a new list of members for the commitee and then see if this list will be accepted by theSoftware Freedom Conservancy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can also volunteer to do a bit of noise and see if we can raise more money.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will not apply for the fellowship, so I hope that in this way we will not have any complaints about my intentions :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS: I have many patches for Twisted that are not commited. I could just hire another person to &quot;review&quot; them, but I don't think that this is fair.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, all the patches already passed an internal review, done by I person paid by my company.
</I>&gt;<i> So, I hope that we can hire an independent reviewer
