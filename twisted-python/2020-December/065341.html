<PRE>Hi,

Based on a comment from Glyph

&gt;<i> The current &quot;project leadership committee&quot; is more than half made up of
</I>people who are a. no longer affiliated with the project and b. never answer
their email at this point,

I started this discussion to see if we can update / refresh the project
leadership committee.

I remember that in 2015 I read the same comment.

Glypy, do you know the required number of members for the committee?

My suggestion is to try to arrange for a committee that is updated every 2
years... or maybe every year.
I can organize the communication and project management stuff.

Here is the list of committers for the last to years

<A HREF="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/graphs/contributors?from=2018-12-16&amp;to=2020-12-16&amp;type=c">https://github.com/twisted/twisted/graphs/contributors?from=2018-12-16&amp;to=2020-12-16&amp;type=c</A>

This is a quantitative approach... and does not imply quality or
dedication, but I think that is a good starting point for searching for
candidates for the committee.

I can also volunteer to be part of the committee.

Maybe we can create a new list of members for the commitee and then see if
this list will be accepted by theSoftware Freedom Conservancy.

I can also volunteer to do a bit of noise and see if we can raise more
money.

I will not apply for the fellowship, so I hope that in this way we will not
have any complaints about my intentions :)

PS: I have many patches for Twisted that are not commited. I could just
hire another person to &quot;review&quot; them, but I don't think that this is fair.
In fact, all the patches already passed an internal review, done by I
person paid by my company.
So, I hope that we can hire an independent reviewer
