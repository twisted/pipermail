</I>Hi Glyph

Thanks for sending the message.
This is bad, but I am confident that we can do the migration in 60 days, as
long as we don't expect to have the exact same Twisted infrastructure.

We have a monthly credit of 150 USD from MS to spend on Azure services.

A quick hack would be to create a new VM in Azure with Ubuntu 18.04 and
migrate the existing server to it.

Do we have other servers hosted with tummy.com, other than
dornkirk.twistedmatrix.com ?

I will not have too much time to do the migration, but I can ask a sysadmin
from my work to help with that and my company will cover that costs.

I think that for now, we should see who is interested with helping with the
migration and after 1 week start to work with that team.

Maybe we will need to schedule an online meeting, but I hope we can do
async work via GitHub Issues (braid) and IRC/Gitter.

I saw that you have already considered using containers for Twisted infra
<A HREF="https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/265">https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/265</A>

In parallel with migrating  dornkirk.twistedmatrix.com, we can look at
outsourcing some of our services.
For example

* Move mailing list to the main Python mailing list server
* Move DNS to a cloud provider (Azure DNS)
* Move Trac Wiki to GitHub Wiki
* Move Trac Tickets to GitHub Issues
* Move static file hosting to GitHub pages
* Move highscore to a container and update it to pull info from GitHub hooks
* IRC bot to some sort of integration to Gitter and then IRC bridge
* Retire speed tests and buildbot

------

&gt;<i>From past experience, I would say that most active Twisted contributors are
</I>software developers and not sysadmin.
So we don't have the resources to keep custom Twisted infrastructure.
And with the limited resources that we have, I would like to see Twisted
contributors work at doing code review, fixing bugs rather than doing
infrastructure work.

So I am +1 for outsourcing as many Twisted services as possible.

I think that we have already outsourced a few services:

* Automated testing to Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions
* Git Hosting to GitHub
* Some Twisted sub-projects use GitHub Issues
* Python package downloads to PyPi
* Documentation hosting to Read The Docs

PS: for quick text messages if you don't like IRC, we are experimenting
with Gitter at <A HREF="https://gitter.im/twisted/twisted">https://gitter.im/twisted/twisted</A>
