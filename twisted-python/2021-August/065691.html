<PRE>Hello Twistors,

Our venerable hosting provider, tummy.com &lt;<A HREF="http://tummy.com/">http://tummy.com/</A>&gt;, will be terminating their business operations on September 30, 2021.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> datetime.date(2021, 9, 30) - datetime.date.today()
</I>datetime.timedelta(days=60)

In addition to being a bit personally sad - Tummy has been an avid supporter of the Twisted community since the very beginning - this means we have just about 60 days to fully migrate our website, mailing list, and DNS's hosting from Dornkirk, the machine where it's been running continuously since 2013, to ... something else.

There are 2 problems here:

We need a sponsor to help us find a new hosting or cloud provider where things can be hosted.  We do pay tummy currently, and we can probably ask the SFC to pay a different hosting provider a similar price for equivalent services, but ideally we'd find someone willing to donate something so as not to put a drain on those resources.

I will need significant help with the operational aspects of the migration.  I typically do a bunch of behind-the-scenes system administration for twistedmatrix.com &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/">http://twistedmatrix.com/</A>&gt; to keep the whole thing clunking along, but after my brain has been fried by a year and a half's worth of pandemic stress, I simply don't have the time, energy, or mental capacity to do this.  I know I've asked for help before and rarely received any, but if I have to do this entirely by myself, the most likely outcome is that I'll migrate DNS to some free cloud thing so at least my email address doesn't break (I migrated SMTP, and thereby everything associated with personal email addresses to Mailgun some years ago, so Tummy is not in that loop for that), and the website (and this mailing list) will simply stop working sometime between now and October.  So if you'd like to keep www.twistedmatrix.com &lt;<A HREF="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/">http://www.twistedmatrix.com/</A>&gt;, speed.twistedmatrix.com &lt;<A HREF="http://speed.twistedmatrix.com/">http://speed.twistedmatrix.com/</A>&gt;, our IRC bot (which is offline anyway right now due to Freenode shutting down), <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/">https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/">https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/</A>&gt;, this mailing list, or our dogfooding instance for Twisted Names DNS, please volunteer so we can start to coordinate.

If you've been wanting to just use Github Issues and don't care about preserving any of the data in Trac, congratulations, you're about to win that argument by default ;-).

In the worst case scenario, I will download a backup image before things get turned off in case someone wants to deal with this
