What I do for my python projects on windows is turn them into a setup.exe that 
the user can run in the traditional way. There are many tools to help you do 
this. Then the user does not need to install anything except your setup.exe.

You do not need python installed on the users system.
And you can sort out the compilation issues when you kit the project.

Make sure you use the right version of visual C++ that matches your
python version.  See <A HREF="https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers">https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers</A>
(Assume the same compiler for 3.7 and 3.8 as 3.6).

I package pysvn, Barry's Emacs and SCM workbench this way for windows.
You can use a similar approach for macOS.
