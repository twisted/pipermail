However, please note that at this point it's not worth discussing unless you have the actual free time to dedicate to doing the py3 port, cleaning up the test coverage, and generally keeping it updated and maintained going forward.  Any PR wanting to un-deprecate it is also going to have to get it working on py3 :-).

NNTP support looks quite independent to me and at this point we can/should apply Amber’s core summit talk to Twisted’s batteries just as well..

This is a nice hypothetical, since I very much doubt that anyone cares enough to resurrect NNTP, so it's nice to discuss without the possibility that reality will rear its ugly head ;-).

In principle I agree with you.  The major practical issue that gets in the way here, if we were to, say, try to do this with twisted.mail, twisted.conch, and twisted.positioning tomorrow (and that makes the existing somewhat large matrix of ancillary projects under the Twisted org somewhat of a maintenance nightmare) is the non-replicability of our various CI setups.

I do ~nothing (other than code reviews) to maintain Twisted these days except for shuffle YAML files back and forth between Appveyor and Travis and Circle and Azure and Codecov and Read The Docs and Coveralls and frankly I'm a bit sick of it.  Already, Klein, Treq, and the Divmod universe lag/diverge somewhat; Ldaptor is completely separately maintained.  The idea of manually redoing this work across a massively exploded matrix of subprojects makes me dizzy.

That said this problem is far from intractable.  Computers are great at automating things, especially other computers.  One thing that occurs to me is that if we maintained a repository containing a cookiecutter template that could be re-run to regenerate the best-practice CI configuration for each project from some minimal configuration (&quot;what python versions do you support&quot;, &quot;do you have C modules&quot;, &quot;what operating systems do you care about testing on&quot;), rather than editing the CI configuration directly, we could possibly make cross-cutting CI changes there, and then re-apply it to all relevant projects.

This will only become more critical as we do stuff like auto-release to PyPI, uploading wheels from CI artifacts.  Which we're doing, like, any day now, right? :)

And, hey, Hynek, you're an expert on how open source projects should be set up, right?  Didn't you give a talk about it recently?  Maybe you could make that repeatable? ;-)

If spinning up a new project were as simple as &quot;run this script to create a repo already hooked up to all the maximally-awesome Twisted-level continuous integration goodness&quot;, I'd feel much better about our already-planned (deferred, filepath) and possible future (basically all protocols but HTTP and AMP probably) split-out projects.

Finally of course we need that bot that we keep talking about which allows external contributors to re-request reviews so we can build <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/">https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/">https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/</A>&gt; and <A HREF="https://twisted.reviews/">https://twisted.reviews/</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://twisted.reviews/">https://twisted.reviews/</A>&gt; on Github, so that other projects can have a unified view across the whole Twisted org ;-).

Heaven forfend.
