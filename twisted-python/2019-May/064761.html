</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On Monday evening, when I submitted this issue, I filled in the form

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I searched the tickets and discovered 1) it didn't appear (so no

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> under 18.4.0 which I had been running uneventfully since last summer.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, I got no feedback, so I assumed my initial attempt to create a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ticket had failed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Someone with access, please mark #9629 as a duplicate and close.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Done.  Looks like <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9462&#160;was">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/9462 was</A> the 
</I>&gt;<i> issue in question; I see your comment on it.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for writing the email to follow up :).

Yes, that's it.  Thanks, Glyph.  (I always get a warm feeling when I see 
a bug* get stomped even when it's just because it's a duplicate!)

I also saw your later comment that it might be related to #7926.  I 
suspect you are correct, though it makes my brain hurt to try to follow 
it.  I think TLS is trying to deal more sensibly with connections 
getting intentionally shut down by either end, but issues still arise 
when shutdowns happen in the middle of negotiations.  (Which broaches 
the issue &quot;can this be leveraged into a DOS attack?&quot;, on top of just 
trying to deal with it correctly.)  In my case, though, I think the 
issue pops up when my server times out and closes the connection, but 
the client end (a vanilla web browser such as Firefox or Chrome) doesn't 
do exactly what the TLS server code expects.  Which side (client or 
server) is behaving incorrectly?  I have no idea.

[*] a computer bug**, not a real bug, for any hard-core Buddhists or 
Jains lurking... ;-)
[**] I've seen the original Mark II/Grace Hopper bug.  It was actually a 
large moth, scotch-taped to the console log...  Found a picture at 
<A HREF="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grace-hoppers-bug">https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/grace-hoppers-bug</A>  (Maybe you can 
tell I'm in full work-avoidance mode.)

PS the web site is working much better today, thanks.
