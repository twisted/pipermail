But I wonder if there's any heuristic we could use to speed up our current strategy, like ordering the to-reap list by putting things with no open FDs at the front of it? And optimistically assuming that once we've found something to reap, maybe we can stop? And maybe it should run in a cooperator, rather than just blocking the reactor indefinitely?

Great!  Anybody feel like filing some tickets? :)

Aah, that's less exciting ;).
