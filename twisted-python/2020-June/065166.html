As others have pointed out, you're stuck with a certain amount of
inheritance to use Twisted. However, this can be fairly minimal. For new
code trying to follow a &quot;sans-io&quot; approach is good too. The go-to
example of this for Twisted is Hyper/H2 and its integration into Twisted
Web for HTTP2 support.

For nearly every protocol you have similar pieces: framing, parsing, a
state-machine and some way to send and receive bytes (&quot;do I/O&quot;).

Keeping these separate has a lot of value. The only part of the above
where you &quot;need to use inheritance&quot; is the I/O part (&quot;because
Twisted&quot;). You don't even technically need to &quot;subclass&quot; because you
could just implement the right interfaces .. but in practice, you
subclass Protocol.

However, you can keep this looking like &quot;just a shim&quot;:

    class Shim(Protocol):

        def connectionMade(self):
            # self.transport is valid now
            self._framing.startup()

        def dataReceived(self, data):
            self._framing.feed_data(data)

        def connectionLost(self, reason):
            self._framing.shutdown()

(This is just one sort of suggestion / psuedo-code here). So your
&quot;framing&quot; object collects bytes and when it has &quot;a message&quot; it can pass
it along to the parser which validates it and turns it into a thing that
it can pass along to the state-machine. All the state-machine needs is
some way to indicate &quot;I have messages to send&quot; (e.g. a callback?) which
is turned into bytes and you call &quot;shim_instance.transport.write()&quot; with
those bytes.

So all those &quot;other&quot; pieces can be written without inheritance. At least
the parser and serializer can probably just be functions.

I recently wrote a relatively simple protocol to try this &quot;sans-io&quot; style
and was happy to start with the state-machine (using Automat). This
forced some good decisions. Then I worked outwards to the &quot;more boring&quot;
bits (framing and serialization/parsing).

(Hmm, this should almost just be a blog-post maybe ;)
