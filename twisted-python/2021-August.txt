Message-ID: <126E7127-9F90-4C2D-BF0C-F5176CD880BC@twistedmatrix.com>

Hello Twistors,

Our venerable hosting provider, tummy.com <http://tummy.com/>, will be terminating their business operations on September 30, 2021.

>>> datetime.date(2021, 9, 30) - datetime.date.today()
datetime.timedelta(days=60)

In addition to being a bit personally sad - Tummy has been an avid supporter of the Twisted community since the very beginning - this means we have just about 60 days to fully migrate our website, mailing list, and DNS's hosting from Dornkirk, the machine where it's been running continuously since 2013, to ... something else.

There are 2 problems here:

We need a sponsor to help us find a new hosting or cloud provider where things can be hosted.  We do pay tummy currently, and we can probably ask the SFC to pay a different hosting provider a similar price for equivalent services, but ideally we'd find someone willing to donate something so as not to put a drain on those resources.

I will need significant help with the operational aspects of the migration.  I typically do a bunch of behind-the-scenes system administration for twistedmatrix.com <http://twistedmatrix.com/> to keep the whole thing clunking along, but after my brain has been fried by a year and a half's worth of pandemic stress, I simply don't have the time, energy, or mental capacity to do this.  I know I've asked for help before and rarely received any, but if I have to do this entirely by myself, the most likely outcome is that I'll migrate DNS to some free cloud thing so at least my email address doesn't break (I migrated SMTP, and thereby everything associated with personal email addresses to Mailgun some years ago, so Tummy is not in that loop for that), and the website (and this mailing list) will simply stop working sometime between now and October.  So if you'd like to keep www.twistedmatrix.com <http://www.twistedmatrix.com/>, speed.twistedmatrix.com <http://speed.twistedmatrix.com/>, our IRC bot (which is offline anyway right now due to Freenode shutting down), https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/ <https://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/>, this mailing list, or our dogfooding instance for Twisted Names DNS, please volunteer so we can start to coordinate.

If you've been wanting to just use Github Issues and don't care about preserving any of the data in Trac, congratulations, you're about to win that argument by default ;-).

In the worst case scenario, I will download a backup image before things get turned off in case someone wants to deal with this

it is sad indeed when friendly businesses terminate operations, 
but Twisted will go on :-).

Let's define this so I and others can ask around with various 
infra providers:

- What is the service currently? (e.g. VPS/Physical? Which 
  resources?)
- Are the resources allocated adequate? Can/should they be 
  increased/reduced?
- Is currently something on the "wishlist" for this service? (e.g. 
  IPv6 support!)
- Even if the goal is and should be for that expense to disappear 
  or go down significantly: roughly what is the compensation being 
  offered for this service? (it might be easier to convince 
  someone to offer it at cost/partial compensation than it is to 
  offer it for free)
- Is location important? E.g. if I asked around and it were 
  fruitful, it'd be EU or Switzerland-based and not US-based as it 
  is right now.

Thank you for both doing this so long and so far and for being 
straightforward about not being able to do it as much now.

I'd like to help and would be particularly (aka more intensively) 
able to do so during August, even if that's just helping document 
what needs to be done and how.
On a day-to-day basis I do some other sysadmin work and if 
necessary would be able to accommodate taking care of 
Twisted-related things into that.

This is the documentation that I am aware of: 
https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Infrastructure
Particularly braid: https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid

Is there anything else to look at? Something known to not be 
supported in braid / only partially supported?
Would you rather schedule some online voice session where I poke 
your brain at what needs to be done (IIRC something similar was 
done about 5 years ago) and take notes that can be used (also by 
someone else) while you let your mind flow happily?

I personally hope this doesn't happen; particularly the mailing 
list is a great low-bandwidth way of staying mostly up-to-date 
with the project.

Hi Glyph

Thanks for sending the message.
This is bad, but I am confident that we can do the migration in 60 days, as
long as we don't expect to have the exact same Twisted infrastructure.

We have a monthly credit of 150 USD from MS to spend on Azure services.

A quick hack would be to create a new VM in Azure with Ubuntu 18.04 and
migrate the existing server to it.

Do we have other servers hosted with tummy.com, other than
dornkirk.twistedmatrix.com ?

I will not have too much time to do the migration, but I can ask a sysadmin
from my work to help with that and my company will cover that costs.

I think that for now, we should see who is interested with helping with the
migration and after 1 week start to work with that team.

Maybe we will need to schedule an online meeting, but I hope we can do
async work via GitHub Issues (braid) and IRC/Gitter.

I saw that you have already considered using containers for Twisted infra
https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/265

In parallel with migrating  dornkirk.twistedmatrix.com, we can look at
outsourcing some of our services.
For example

* Move mailing list to the main Python mailing list server
* Move DNS to a cloud provider (Azure DNS)
* Move Trac Wiki to GitHub Wiki
* Move Trac Tickets to GitHub Issues
* Move static file hosting to GitHub pages
* Move highscore to a container and update it to pull info from GitHub hooks
* IRC bot to some sort of integration to Gitter and then IRC bridge
* Retire speed tests and buildbot

------

>From past experience, I would say that most active Twisted contributors are
software developers and not sysadmin.
So we don't have the resources to keep custom Twisted infrastructure.
And with the limited resources that we have, I would like to see Twisted
contributors work at doing code review, fixing bugs rather than doing
infrastructure work.

So I am +1 for outsourcing as many Twisted services as possible.

I think that we have already outsourced a few services:

* Automated testing to Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions
* Git Hosting to GitHub
* Some Twisted sub-projects use GitHub Issues
* Python package downloads to PyPi
* Documentation hosting to Read The Docs

PS: for quick text messages if you don't like IRC, we are experimenting
with Gitter at https://gitter.im/twisted/twisted

If you can get me copies of Mailman's lists/twisted-python/config.pck
and lists/twisted-web/config.pck configuration files and
archives/private/twisted-python.mbox/twisted-python.mbox and
archives/private/twisted-web.mbox/twisted-web.mbox archive mailboxes, I
can import these on mail.python.org.

The twisted-web list seems pretty inactive currently, but twisted-python
seems fairly active. Ideally we can arrange a time for you to shut down
the lists and get me the files and get the lists up on mail.python.org.
Otherwise, if the lists are still operational while I'm getting the
files and doing the imports, messages and perhaps other changes will be
lost, although it is possible to import additional messages to the
archives after the fact.

I will be available to do this during the next two weeks, but I will not
be available for the rest of August and the first two weeks of September.

Great news.  I'd be happy to move the mailing lists over to let someone else maintain their infrastructure.  Particularly if we could get off of Mailman 2, which has been no fun to maintain.

Many personal email addresses of core team members (including, um, this one) are forwarded by our mail hosting provider, Mailgun, and so moving the MX records directly is a non-starter, but we could easily point lists.twistedmatrix.com <http://lists.twistedmatrix.com/> at python.org <http://python.org/>, or we could just use @python.org addresses and be quite happy.  twisted at python.org <mailto:twisted at python.org> would be very cool.  We could also maintain a forwarding alias for compatibility for a little while, but I'd kinda rather deprecate posting to twisted-python at twistedmatrix.com <mailto:twisted-python at twistedmatrix.com> for a couple of other reasons anyway.

Do we have a way to get our pipermail archive URLs (which are linked in tickets, in source code, etc) to redirect to the fancy new hyperkitty interface, or should those just be static HTML?  (I'm kinda fine with either, honestly, although the former would be nice if we can manage it easily.)

I am happy to coordinate off-list about a secure way to exchange these data files (or anyone with administrator access to Dornkirk can just do it directly).  Please send the announcement of the new address here first so we know when to cut over posting, and so that folks aren't surprised to see a new list-id.

(At this point I think I'm happy to just nuke twisted-web as part of this migration; we can keep the archive up as static HTML for posterity, but it's mostly unused at this point, and the distinction doesn't make sense.)

A forwarding alias seems the best choice. twisted at python.org is indeed cool

I actually think it's better to move twisted-web first and see what it
looks, then mess about there with redirects, then do the main mailing
list. I think the redirects would be fairly easy as the URL structure
is the same

As a wise computer once sung, "We do what we must, because we can".

It's certainly annoying (and I'm very sad to see tummy go, they were great) but I think we may be happy with the opportunity to reduce the amount of stuff we operate.

This is great news!  Presumably I … already have access to this, somehow?  Is it in the 1password team vault?  How do I see it?  Do we have a commitment from MS to actually maintain this credit?

> A quick hack would be to create a new VM in Azure with Ubuntu 18.04 and migrate the existing server to it.

If we need to provision a new server anyway, could we provision it on the most recent ubuntu?  Presumably most of the stuff we require will still be on there?  If it's a hassle let's fall back to 18.04 but let's not set ourselves up to be outdated as long as we're doing this work.

> Do we have other servers hosted with tummy.com <http://tummy.com/>, other than dornkirk.twistedmatrix.com <http://dornkirk.twistedmatrix.com/> ?

Nope.  We used to have a VPS called Wolfwood, but in an act of nominative determinism, it had to die for the greater good.  (It was our source-control server, back when that was a thing you had to run yourself.  We shut it down when we migrated to github.)

Thanks Adi, this is very generous.  Let me know if I'm needed to give this sysadmin any requisite privileges.

Looks like a team is coming together :).

Yeah, async seems to be working fine.

Yes. I'd love to do this, and if such a migration reduces effort, then let's do it by all means - I just don't want to get caught up in trying to do this and ending up with things broken when the clock runs out.

Looks like this is full steam ahead!

> * Move DNS to a cloud provider (Azure DNS)

I've already pulled the trigger to migrate our DNS to Gandi, since they're our registrar and I already know I can provision certificates against their LiveDNS API :).  We do still have to get a few other domains off of this infrastructure though, I'll do the ones we control (Divunal) and contact folks at the others.

Longer-term, I would like to host some DNS, since I want to make sure that twisted.names does not bit-rot.  However, perhaps a prerequisite to setting this up again will be (A) containerizing it and (B) providing something like Sentry for us to track exceptions, so that the dog-fooding here is interesting and not just a tedious obligation that produces gigabytes full of tracback-laden log files that nobody ever looks at or fixes.

> * Move Trac Wiki to GitHub Wiki

The trac wiki's main purpose is not really to serve as a wiki-style editable document repository, but rather to host the website.  I think migrating it to something like Pelican, or some other static-site management thing might make more sense.

Sure, sure, as soon as we figure out a way to preserve all the links :).

I wonder if it would make sense for www.twistedmatrix.com <http://www.twistedmatrix.com/> itself to be hosted by

+1.  This thing might be interesting <https://github.com/leereilly/github-high-scores <https://github.com/leereilly/github-high-scores>> in that it might be a better starting point than our own code (which is not even open source because, among other reasons, it is such trash) this version gets the point of the scoring wrong, which is to weight 

> * IRC bot to some sort of integration to Gitter and then IRC bridge

Given that this is already broken right now, I'd say "don't bother migrating the IRC bot right away".  This also means we don't need amptrac, and we can rebuild the IRC bot in a more sustainable way, inside a container, later

> * Retire speed tests and buildbot

Buildbot yes, speed tests no.  I agree that speedcenter is not super well maintained, but it does at least give us some sense of performance, and right now it's all we've got.  (If you can find some cloud CI thing like Github Actions which does anything with perf we should destroy speedcenter immediately, but given that PyPy still uses it, I have to imagine it's the best thing going.  We should absolutely put it in a container though.

We should expect all of our relative perf data to become garbage when we move to new hosting hardware, of course.

Absolutely.

> So I am +1 for outsourcing as many Twisted services as possible. 

My only caveat to this is that I think it would be interesting to be able to host fun stuff that uses Twisted.  Some kind of goofy webchat thing or minimal real-time game to show off event-driven communication.  (Also maybe we should have first-party websockets support, but I digress.)  Maybe some public IMAP server that you can connect a mail client to that does something weird that isn't quite email.  Maybe a logbot that can talk to the IRC channel.  These things should all be containerized, and should not be permanently required for the project's workflows to work (writing such a toy should not be the same as committing to maintain it forever; if it breaks, it can break and we let it go), but we shouldn't aspire to pare down to nothing running in the cloud.

That said, to have the energy to write, set up, and maintain such things, we do have to discard the perpetual albatross of propping up a years-old non-containerized system with tons of mystery miserable mutable state in it.  (I really think relieving ourselves of Mailman will get rid of most of the stuff that makes this difficult, though, so I'm quite excited to get that migration underway.)

Don't forget moving our mail hosting & forwarding to Mailgun (which mailgun donates for free, thank you mailgunners)!

Sounds like a good plan.

Speaking of using testing areas rather than the most heavily used production stuff:

One thing that perhaps bears mentioning here is that we do have a second domain name that I bought at some expense for the project - in part to celebrate its 20th anniversary at … PyCon 2020 (sob): twisted.org <http://twisted.org/>.  If this minor emergency is sparking anyone's interest in slowly building some new infrastructure (like a new website) on clean, modern infra, without the pressure to keep something working continuously, we could host it all there and cut over twistedmatrix.com <http://twistedmatrix.com/> to be a redirect at the appropriate time.

We only have a single server. It is  called "dornkirk"

The priority is to have the services up and running, even after dornkirk is
dead.

To coordinate migration and also day-to-day Twisted project things we use
the IRC Libera channel #twisted-dev

If you don't like IRC ... we are also experiencing with Gitter/Matrix
https://gitter.im/twisted/twisted

I start this to-do list https://github.com/twisted-infra/braid/issues/277

There is not much documentation... we need to rely on memories :)
So don't bother to search for documentation, and just ask :)

Yes. braid is our deployment as code thing... is the best we have in terms
of documenting the infrastructure.

"braid" is (was?) the Twisted customization on top of fabric for doing
primitive automated deployment.

The plan is to stop using braid and do all the deployment via images and
containers.

We are split between Europe time zone (UTC -> UTC+2) and US ( something

For now, we have done only ad-hoc meetings.

I think that the plan is to migrate the mailing list to the Python Org
mailing list hosting.

We will need some help with setting  up archive redirections.

---------------

I think the current problem is finding or deciding for the next hosting /
VM / container provider.

We have 150 USD per month from MS to spend on Azure, but this is renewed
any year without any guarantee that next year we will receive the free
credit.
The subscription was requested by Python Software Foundation and was
granted by MS, but it was associated to the Azure AD of my organization.

I have no idea how to create an Azure AD for Twisted organization, so that
I can transfer the subscription.

So...if anyone has any experience with Azure AD, it would help to get this
thing sorted.

For now, using Azure is plan B... so if we don't manage to migrate the
services somewhere else, we (I) can just create an Ubuntu VM in Azure and
migrate the existing dornkirk services there.

------------

The DNS was already migrated by Glyph. Thanks Glyph :)

The mailing lists will be migrated soon to Python Org... we only have to
see how to do it in a seamless way.

--------

So Evilham, if you want to help, try to see if you can hang out over IRC or
Gitter and we can see how you can help.
Thanks!

 Lists hosting
Message-ID: <CAFycZ9ez4=nhXd67o_5ks+Wqrucd+KK2-XdyOpin40FNTpcjKw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This is a quick message to let you know that the current mailing list service
will migrate from the Twisted own hosted services
to the mailing list service provided by the Python organization.

The migration is scheduled to start on the 5th of August, 2021
17:00 UTC time (10:00am PDT / 18:00 BST)

The following email address will no longer be available:

    twisted at twistedmatrix.com

The new address will be:

    twisted at python.org

The new archive will be hosted at the following link that will be
available after the migration:

    https://mail.python.org/archives/list/twisted at python.org/

All existing subscribers will be migrated.

If you only interact with the mailing list using your email
you only need to update your existing filters
and update your email contact address for the list.

The migration is expected to take about 3 hours.

After the migration, Glyph plans to implement an email redirection,
so even if you send emails to the old address we should still receive them.
Subject to availability :)

We also plan to redirect (via HTTP 308) the old mailing list pages and
archives to the new pages.
This will also happen after the migration.

Have a nice day... and talk to you soon on the new mailing list.

PS: while we do the migration you can still get in touch using
    IRC on Libera #twisted channel
    Matrix/Gitter at https://gitter.im/twisted/twisted

This was very poorly worded, my bad.
I meant how big of a machine (storage excluding ML archives, RAM, 
CPU, traffic) is currently used and whether or not it is 
over/under-provisioned.
Without knowing this concretely, it is hard to try to get an 
entity to commit to donating resources.

It is good to know that VM vs physical and location are not 
important factors.

IM is particularly taxing these days.

The TODO list looks quite comprehensive, thank you.

Mailing list was certainly the most concerning point, it's great 
that it's already being solved \o/ handling mailing lists is 
really not fun.

Using the registrar's DNS makes sense short-term, mid-term as 
Glyph mentioned twisted.names should be used by the project so 
there is starker incentive to keep it working and somewhat up to 
date.
Having this functionality allows for interesting use-cases: 
https://github.com/evilham/weneeda.name
IIRC there was a way to setup Gandi to mirror a zone periodically, 
so that'd be good redundancy.
Anyway, that's for somewhen else.

After catching up on some other things, I'll take a more serious 
look at what I can help with from the TODO.
