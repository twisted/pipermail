I missed a great opportunity. :)

&gt;<i> I'd be happy to see what you come up with in terms of a site specifically

</I>&gt;<i> you want to make an IRC bot or a name server or an all-singing all-dancing

</I>
Yes, there will need to be more than one thing (whether that means
different sites or different landing pages on the same site).

&gt;<i> But let's not neglect the existing site!  I can see a lot of value of having
</I>&gt;<i> some alternate entry-points, but there are probably things that you'd like
</I>&gt;<i> those entry-points to link to on the Twisted site proper, which may not
</I>&gt;<i> exist.  If you'd like make them exist by doing some web site maintenance
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;wiki gardening&quot;), I'd be happy to give you the relevant credentials on
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/.">https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/.</A>  Patches to documentation are always
</I>&gt;<i> welcome too, although (as always) we need help to get the review queue back
</I>&gt;<i> to a manageable size so they can be landed in a timely manner.  Even little
</I>&gt;<i> changes (like this update that I made to the Trial page a few years ago) can
</I>&gt;<i> help a lot.
</I>
Agreed.  My goal is to get them into the existing house/library, not
to build and manage an entirely new one.  Really, I just want them to
have a few great experiences AND to realize that a webserver is just
_one_ kind of server.  For example, it made me giddy the first time I
got a netstring state machine working.  And everyone at work was blown
away when I replaced our existing WSGI-server with Twisted (it doesn't
drop connections anymore).

My goal is to make them giddy, then set them loose in the house.

I can also do some wiki gardening (I've noticed Tom Prince has done a
lot of great gardening).  I'm thinking I'll find weeds as I look for
pages to send people to after making them giddy.

&gt;<i> I'm pretty sure we can scare up some hosting resources for things if you
</I>&gt;<i> want to have some kind of demo persistent Twisted services running.
</I>&gt;<i> twistedmatrix.com is no longer buckling under the pressure of its users -
</I>&gt;<i> why, I just ssh'd in, and the load is less than 1.0!  By our historical
</I>&gt;<i> standards that's practically idle! ;-)  And we have some other machines that
</I>&gt;<i> we have not had the system administration bandwidth to make effective use
</I>&gt;<i> of.
</I>
Great!  I will start working on a demo.

&gt;<i> It's also worthwhile to periodically really review the state of things, so
</I>&gt;<i> you don't fix problems that are already fixed, or at least you build on
</I>&gt;<i> solutions that are already in progress.  Sometimes us old-timers who
</I>&gt;<i> remember when the docs were _really_ bad and there were _big_ gaps (the
</I>&gt;<i> mention of the &quot;index&quot; makes me think you are remembering when
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/">http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/</A>&gt; was just a blank directory
</I>&gt;<i> listing) don't always appreciate how much things have improved in the
</I>&gt;<i> intervening years.
</I>
This is why I'm optimistic about Twisted.  Things _do_ improve, though
Google seems to think Twisted is still version 8.2.0 (it was to that
quirk of Google, the Indexer, that I referred in my story)

Here's what I've got already.  (I don't love it yet -- it already
feels too cluttered -- but it's a start):
