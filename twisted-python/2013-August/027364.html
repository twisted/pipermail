Or it means Tom's workflow is fine and he's learned all the issues he 
needs to avoid tripping over.

You didn't quote anything in the message you replied to, so I'll just 
guess that this is an email meant as a &quot;+1 please switch to github&quot;. 
Please correct that impression if it is mistaken.

If it is not mistaken, then please let this sub-thread of the discussion 
die right here (reasons for doing so already given in near countless 
previous threads).  The ideas suggested elsewhere for encouraging more 
reviewers and other contributions seem more likely to bear fruit.  Let's 
follow through on those.

Thanks,
Jean-Paul
