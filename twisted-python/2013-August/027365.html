That sounds like what I mean. I don't understand the difference. I am
saying that Tom's workflow is fine and knows where the hard parts are.
Also, given the amount of time that he (usually) gets to spend on Twisted
and his responsiveness on the IRC channel, I think it counts as
&quot;well-supported&quot;.


&gt;<i> You didn't quote anything in the message you replied to, so I'll just

</I>&gt;<i> correct that impression if it is mistaken.

No. I am suggesting that there is a way to contribute using Github that
isn't totally broken, and someone has already figured out what that way is,
and that someone is in a position to explain it to others. I'm saying we
don't need to switch to github, because apparently you can already use
github if you want to, everything else staying the same.

It's possible that this way of using github does not please the would-be
new reviewers sufficiently, but I'm saying that if someone suggests we move
to github, I'd like to make it clear to them that you can already use
github, and that they should probably at least formulate their arguments in
the shape of &quot;the current way that I can use github is bad because ...&quot; :)

Thanks,
&gt;<i> Jean-Paul
