<PRE>This all sounds good. I think another good thing to do might be to unify
the theme format between native and java versions of the faucet (this is
mostly the fault of the native version, but some changes would need to be
made on the java side too).

Anybody subscribed here know something about xp multimedia projects?

The Tao is like a glob pattern:             It is masked but always present.
used but never used up.                     I don't know who built to it.
It is like the extern void:                 It came before the first kernel.
filled with infinite possibilities.         [<A HREF="mailto:glyph@twistedmatrix.com">glyph@twistedmatrix.com</A>]

</I>&gt;<i> which is much much cooler than having abrupt cutoffs when you move.

</I>&gt;<i>
