<PRE>To begin; please don't crosspost -- although this is a discussion which
has *some* authoring components, it's still mainly a technical discussion.
Authors who want to have a hand in deciding how things like this work
should have a hand in the code anyway; so all you're doing by crossposting
is making it so all interested parties get the message twice, and
everybody else gets it and deletes it.

Not really, no.  That is, as with all other features of TR, merely a
reasonable default.  We could *also* have the description dynamically
switched in and out, but that's not usually going to be the case.

Secondly, I challenge you to make an example description where these
actions don't occurr where weather is still this important :-)  The player
is not necessarily walking along this path -- they could have teleported
there, or they could be stationary for a long time.  They could be having
a picknick there.

I disagree.  The fact that things are described independantly might make
the flow a little harder to control, but it *does* allow us a great deal
of flexibility in designing a dynamic environment.  It should be a
constraint that the authors work with... after all, if we have highly
specific descriptions, they are necessarily static.  This *IS* the reason
we came up with description elements in the first place :-)
