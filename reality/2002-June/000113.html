<PRE>Here's the use case: we need to be able to have a ship (which is made of
multiple rooms) enter a spaceport entirely and make its entrances available to
people in the spaceport. The ship may have multiple entrances: one for the
cockpit and one for the cargo bay, f.e.

Two concepts here:
  1) collection of rooms. We probable need an &quot;Area&quot; class or something.
  2) &quot;entrances&quot;. We need areas (or perhaps any object with an 'entrances'
     attribute?) to be able to expose them to their current location.

So here's what dash, exarkun, and I came up with:

  We'll have an Area class. Probably every room will have a reference to the
  area its in. Any exits that are created in a room 'bob' that lead to
  'bob.area' (or perhaps a special constant OUTSIDE, which I think is more
  readable) will send the player to bob.area.location. So, that was the easy
  part: regular exits. Entrances will be similar, but instead of *leading* to
  bob.area (or OUTSIDE), their *source* will be bob.area. This assumes two
  things: that we have first class Exit objects that have both &quot;source&quot; and
  &quot;dest&quot; properties, and that there is a hook bound to creating exits in a room
  that checks whether or not exit.source == room.area. If it is, then add the
  Exit object to areaObj.entrances.

  So that's entrances and exits. Making the entrances available to
  area.location would take nothing more than a hook inserted into the
  &quot;movement&quot; event, to the new location to update its exits list.

OK, so this doesn't seem like a very robust solution after some consideration
(at least that entrances bit, anyway) - f.e., what happens if you change the
source of the Exit object after it's created?

Hrm, then again, we could just make the special Area-checking part of the Exit
class, so that's no worry (i.e., add a set_source method that checks whether
source is an area object, if it is, tell it to update its entrances).

Suggestions welcome.
