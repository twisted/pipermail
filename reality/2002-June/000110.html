</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Yay.  I have long dreamt of a system capable of properly handling
</I>&gt;<i> multiple styles of input, but never had either the skill or the drive to
</I>&gt;<i> make it happen.  Are the existing Beyond documents available to the
</I>&gt;<i> general public, or are seekrut ninja access codes required?
</I>
There are two documents that you can read at:

    <A HREF="http://www.asbahr.com/papers.html">http://www.asbahr.com/papers.html</A>

However, neither of these will match the mind-altering onslaught of the Beyond
2.0 paper, which will unify Jason's experience in the field to date, as well as
document the plans for an open-source platform rather than a closed-source
game.

&gt;<i> &gt; So, that said, the initial motivation I have to do something to sentence
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will be to separate the process of parsing text (determining intent)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the process of dispatching actions (determining consequences).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Each game will need to both extend the parser and dispatch new kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actions.
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; [snip : text parsing is fun, documentation is good, users are unclueful]
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; Once you're done dealing with whatever mangled garbage the so-called
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;user&quot; has deposited at your prompt, you only know what they *want*. [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oararkgurglegurgle...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So this is basically the &quot;central command registry&quot; or whatever it's
</I>&gt;<i> called?  My main concern about this is that it makes it somewhat difficult
</I>&gt;<i> to differentiate between commands (Intentions, Abilities, Skills...) that
</I>&gt;<i> go by the same name.  Perhaps this is a moot point if the Intentions are
</I>&gt;<i> dispatched properly, ie, only to what would currently be the ambient_*,
</I>&gt;<i> verb_*, and ability_* methods Reality has.  I have trouble groking this
</I>&gt;<i> sort of thing without an implementation to pick up and poke and try to
</I>&gt;<i> break :)
</I>
In order to respond to a particular action, you're going to have to implement
the interface associated with that action, rather than dispatching simply on
action name.  Hopefully, there will be a rather large unified action repository
that is sufficient for most games.  (For example, I hope for PickUp, PickLock,
and Choose to be in the base Reality distribution).

&gt;<i> &gt; [stuff shouldn't all be unique]
</I>
&gt;<i>   Hooray.  I'm all for uniqueness, but I'm not God, or even a major diety,
</I>&gt;<i> I can't make stuff that fast :)  I have some ideas for an item
</I>&gt;<i> construction system to let players partially participate in the creation
</I>&gt;<i> process (Nothing unique, I'm sure.  I've been told it's a lot like the EQ
</I>&gt;<i> system) and algorithmic generation can be another source of unique, if not
</I>&gt;<i> terribly creative, items/locations/creatures, but a template system (which
</I>&gt;<i> is already partially available simply via python classes) strikes me as a
</I>&gt;<i> must-have.
</I>
Getting to know some existing systems is a pretty good idea.  Player-generated
content systems generally fall into two categories; decoration and crafting.
Decoration systems allow players to position items in aesthetically different
configurations essentially for free; crafting systems allow players to create
new items from specified formulas.

I hope that dash eventually works out the generalized &quot;chemistry&quot; system that
he described in his last post to the Divunal list one day...

&gt;<i> &gt; [snip : a game that makes sense]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I still have a lot more thought to give this, since I'm re-treading
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ground I haven't walked on for quite some time, as well as waiting to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see how the critical related components of Beyond turn out.  Any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comments on the general direction?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Comments... Comments... Can't think of anything more interesting than
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;sounds good&quot; at the moment.  Please, keep us updated :)
</I>
I will.  Thanks for not being too impatient :-).  Speaking of keeping folks
updated, if you guys could use this list to discuss your changes and updates to
Reality that would be great.

&gt;<i> &quot;Minerals are inexhaustible and will never be depleted. A stream of

This cracked me up :-)
