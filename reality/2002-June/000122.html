    &gt;&gt; Is that all you meant? how about going a bit more in depth for these
    &gt;&gt; cases?

    Jp&gt;    Um, yea, mostly I was just listing some more examples.  The only
    Jp&gt; real difference most of these would have from ships is they'd be one
    Jp&gt; room areas.  They also demonstrate why being able to look through an
    Jp&gt; entrance might be nice.  eg, &quot;look through flap on tent&quot; after you
    Jp&gt; &quot;open flap on tent&quot; to see if anyone is inside (and of course, don't
    Jp&gt; show anyone inside the oil drum if the top is on).

    Jp&gt;   Hmmm.  One room areas.  Would it be worth it to specialize on that
    Jp&gt; case?  Nah, probably not...

See, we wouldn't necessarily need them to be Areas. They can just be _any_
Thing with an 'entrances' attribute. i.e., a Tent object might have
self.entrances = [Exit(from=OUTSIDE, to=self)], or something like that.

    &gt;&gt; That's what the 'entrances' attribute would be (A list of Exit objects
    &gt;&gt; meant to be exposed to the containing room). adding and removing stuff
    &gt;&gt; from &quot;entrances&quot; can probably be implicit -- that's the point of having
    &gt;&gt; Exit objects track what their 'source' and 'dest' properties are. Unless
    &gt;&gt; you can come up with another reason for an explicit API :)

    Jp&gt;   Arg, implicit.  Okay, it fits with the rest of Reality, I guess I'll
    Jp&gt; just have to get used to it. :)

IMO, it's not too bad at all, because the (defined!) behavior seems pretty
simplistic, and there aren't any whacky cases that I can see that will confuse
people.

    Jp&gt;   Going back to the case of ships, say we have a hangar with 10
    Jp&gt; freighters prepping for launch.  &quot;go hatch&quot; just doesn't cut it.  &quot;go
    Jp&gt; hatch on Sunrise II&quot; works a little better, though &quot;go through the
    Jp&gt; hatch on the Sunrise II&quot; is nicest ;) Syntax aside, a way to
    Jp&gt; disambiguate entrances is a must.  You can't count on the names being
    Jp&gt; unique since creators will have no way of knowing in what company their
    Jp&gt; ship will eventually end up.  Extending ambient_go to recognize

Probably verb_go/enter, if we do end up going with first class Exits.

    Jp&gt; &quot;through&quot; and/or &quot;on&quot; and then passing the Thing that is matched by
    Jp&gt; those prepositions to findExit() or findDirection() makes sense to me.

Yeah, I agree. This is why sentence needs to be flexible enough to allow
completely &quot;non-conformant&quot; commands, and being able to override object
lookup... or something. I'm tired.
