  Other things that come to mind - temporary or permanant enclosures, such
as a tent Thing that could be carried around and then unpacked, set up,
and entered; ground vehicles; or &quot;scenery&quot; such as an oil drum.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two concepts here:
</I>&gt;<i>   1) collection of rooms. We probable need an &quot;Area&quot; class or something.
</I>&gt;<i>   2) &quot;entrances&quot;. We need areas (or perhaps any object with an 'entrances'
</I>&gt;<i>      attribute?) to be able to expose them to their current location.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>   'bob.area' (or perhaps a special constant OUTSIDE, which I think is more
</I>&gt;<i>   readable) will send the player to bob.area.location. So, that was the easy
</I>&gt;<i>   part: regular exits. Entrances will be similar, but instead of *leading* to
</I>&gt;<i>   bob.area (or OUTSIDE), their *source* will be bob.area. This assumes two
</I>&gt;<i>   things: that we have first class Exit objects that have both &quot;source&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;dest&quot; properties, and that there is a hook bound to creating exits in a room
</I>&gt;<i>   that checks whether or not exit.source == room.area. If it is, then add the
</I>&gt;<i>   Exit object to areaObj.entrances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   So that's entrances and exits. Making the entrances available to
</I>&gt;<i>   area.location would take nothing more than a hook inserted into the
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;movement&quot; event, to the new location to update its exits list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so this doesn't seem like a very robust solution after some consideration
</I>&gt;<i> (at least that entrances bit, anyway) - f.e., what happens if you change the
</I>&gt;<i> source of the Exit object after it's created?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hrm, then again, we could just make the special Area-checking part of the Exit
</I>&gt;<i> class, so that's no worry (i.e., add a set_source method that checks whether
</I>&gt;<i> source is an area object, if it is, tell it to update its entrances).
</I>
  Yea, movement hooks would do most of it, then exit can track the rest.
Area should have an interface for adding/removing these exits (as well as
getting a list of them, of course).

  It would be nice if this didn't break the existing exit code.  I guess
these types of exits would only be accessable via a new ability?
Enter/leave or something like that.  Could this be folded into the
existing interface on Thing, perhaps with an option &quot;of&quot; or &quot;on&quot; parameter
to findDirection() that defaults to None?  Or maybe it makes sense to do
the access in a new method..
