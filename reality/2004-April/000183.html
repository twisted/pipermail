  I suspected this was the case.  I am trying to come up with concrete examples of how one of these criterion objects would be implemented and having a fairly difficult time of it.

  Briefly, I thought different types of criterion objects could be used when collecting different interfaces,  Unfortunately it seems that radix and I demolished that possiblity at PyCon by calling the criterion object in _collect():

def _collect(asker, start, interface, criterion, radius=2):
    seen = {}
    selfish = interface(start, default=None)
    if selfish is not None and criterion(selfish):
        yield (0, selfish)
        seen[id(selfish)] = True
    for distance, collector in _evermore(start, asker, interface, criterion, radius):
        for implementor in collector.find(asker, interface, criterion):
            if id(implementor) not in seen:
                yield distance, implementor
                seen[id(implementor)] = True

  The change fixed a bug where too many objects were being collected.  Maybe there is another way to accomplish the same thing without using the criterion object.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A good example of &quot;more stuff&quot; might be a 'refine' method on criterion 
</I>&gt;<i> to aggregate them, whereby one might (somehow) indicate that one is 
</I>&gt;<i> requesting an object *both* whose name is &quot;sword&quot; *and* whose owner is 
</I>&gt;<i> me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
  So, here's a random thought for the structure of the criterion object:

    criterion = [
        (common.INoun, 'name', lambda o: o == 'sword'),
        (something.IPosession, 'owner', lambda o: o is glyph),
    ]

  Of course, this only allows for one kind of logical boolean connector.  A possible fix would be to build up a tree representing the criteria, e.g.:

    criterion = AND(
        (common.INoun, 'name', lambda o: o == 'sword'),
        (something.IPosession, 'owner', lambda o: o is glyph)
    )

  with all the other obvious callables such as OR, NOT etc.  This adds a pretty hefty burden to the implementors of find() and more() though.

  Better ideas (please)?
