  Summary of conversation on IRC tonight:

    We want to start a containment implementation.  Some things it should support include simple room/exit structures, cardboard boxes, lead boxes, glass boxes, and brass cockroaches.  It should also support an observation [sub]system of some sort, including both vision in the normal spectrum and in the x-ray spectrum (&quot;See through lots of stuff, but not lead&quot;).

    The major point of discussion was over who should be responsible for knowing that x-rays pass through cardboard and glass, but not lead, and that human-visible spectrum light passes through glass, but not cardboard or lead.

    A good answer seems to be that a materials system should be responsible for knowing this.  This appears to require a change to imagination.simulacrum.collect().  The current Look action is implemented only in terms of the IDescribable interface (possibly a mistake, but probably unrelated to the real issue).  With the current imagination.simulacrum.Container implementation of ICollector, there is no way to have Look bypass all barriers in the object graph (such as a closed cardboard box) and filter the result based on some containment system.

    The main idea discussed to make this possible was the addition of a second criterion, for use with ICollector.more() (whereas the current criterion is used with both, though the current implementation uses it only in find()).  As an alternative to adding a second criterion, it also seems possible to change the current criterion to an introspectable object (*not* a Componentized, as radix suggested in an attempt to fry my brain) which would provide enough information to filter both collectors/more and implements/find in semantically different ways.  This preserves the existing interfaces, more or less, and forces us to fix criterion sooner rather than later, so maybe is a better solution.

    So!  What does all this mean?  Perhaps something like this:

    class Look(TargetAction):
        ....

        def doAction(self):
            ....
            if usingXRayVision:
                c = collect(self.target, IDescribable,
                            # Only implementors that are lead can actually be seen
                            lambda o: IMaterial(o).type == 'lead',
                            # Only collectors that are lead cannot be seen through
                            lambda o: IMaterial(o).type != 'lead',
                            2)
            else:
                c = collect(self.target, IDescribable,
                            # All implementors are visible
                            lambda o: True,
                            # Open and transparent containers can be seen through
                            lambda o: not ICloseable(o).closed or IMaterial(o).type == 'glass'
                            2)
            ....

    Does this seem to be at all on the right track?

  Jp
