Hello, I am new to the list and to Imagination, but I am interested in 
Imagination.
I have written a couple of MUD servers from scratch in Python and came 
across this, thinking it might be a nice starting point for a new 
server.

I fiddled with it for about two days and could not figure out how to 
get it working.
I kept getting errors trying to run the various files, so I would try 
to find the modules that were missing or make minor code changes to see 
if i could get it running, but no dice.

Is there any documentation for the project? I found only minimal 
explanations of the theory of the library, not "how to run it."

I'd be interested to live chat with someone who is familiar with 
Imagination, if someone wants to.
my AIM is ferggo, or MSN is ferggo@hotmail.com (if anyone actually uses 
MSN)

Thanks, I'd love to see this project develop and would be happy to 
contribute, but I can't seem to figure out how to see it running.

  Not so much.  The project is still in a state where getting a server to actually run is less important that other things (like having an actually working simulation core ;)  Alas, there is also not much time being spent on Imagination these days, due to requirements of other projects.

  In any case, to start up a server, you want to do something like this:

    exarkun@boson:~/Projects/svn/Imagination/trunk/sandbox$ PYTHONPATH=~/Projects/svn/Twisted/trunk/:~/Projects/svn/Nevow/trunk/:~/Projects/svn/Imagination/trunk/  twistd -noy imagination.tac 

  Make sure you actually have trunk@HEAD of Twisted and Nevow.

  Hopefully you'll be rewarded with a bunch of crud ending in some lines that talk about "Starting factory ..."  By default, you get a telnet server on port 4009, an ssh server on 4022, a web server on 4242, and a manhole server on 4010.

  We hang out on IRC a bunch, irc.freenode.net, in #imagination.  The channel is quite frequently completely dead, but there are usually at least a few people idling there.  Be glad to chat with you some time.  I'm Jpswoogle on AIM, but I'm hardly ever actually on.
