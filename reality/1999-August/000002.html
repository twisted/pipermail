Good.  It was late, and GuestLogin was really a hack -- I spent most of my
time fixing transferControlTo :-) (It was really broken)

OK.  That's spiffy.  I don't know what it means though :-)

Cool!  It's been moved to the official mac website.  I'm glad we've got at

Windows download is going to work at all ... we need to write a VB script
to find their freaking Java VM...
