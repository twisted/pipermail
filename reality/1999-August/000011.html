Yes that is a good point. I don't know if we could actually ever make
enough categories for that to work, so I thought maybe it would be okay to
just make arbitrary colors 1-20 or something...define them in one theme,
and then redefine them in other ones, making sure that colors that look
nice together in the reference theme look nice in the other themes.

&gt;<i>2) Separation of color should be done atomically by &quot;hears&quot; statement, not
</I>&gt;<i>as HTML-esque tags in the text being sent.  hears() should take an

</I>
I disagree. If someone makes an area like that, then it should just be
deleted. Its not the code's buisness to enforce aesthetic rules. Besides
which, this is a general mechanism encompassing color, styles, sizes, and
embedded picture icons.
