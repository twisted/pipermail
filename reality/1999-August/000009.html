The put example is easy. (and btw, twisted.reality.plugin.Put is horribly
broken).
twisted.reality.plugin.Put should not apply when you're putting the
verbObject() on something else. That put only works to put something else
ON the verbObject(). Therefore, there is really no ambiguity involved...
However, there is currently a problem in the implementation...there is no
way for it to know if there will be an ambiguity before executing one of
the verbs. We could either get rid of AmbiguousVerbException, and try all
the verbs and hope that none of them conflict (all but one of them would
return false). This might actually not be bad, since if all the verbs are
written properly, there probably won't actually be a conflict.
or we could make a applies() method which would get called on each of the
verbs to weed them down to one instead of using the return false method.

Take grappling hook with claw is exactly the same thing situation.
Say with microphone to person is not much of a problem either. People don't
have a say feature at all...so there is no conflict.
