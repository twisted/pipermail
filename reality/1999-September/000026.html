<PRE>Our new server (a brand-new VA Research VARServer 501 (for the
uninitiated, this means dual-processor 450 MhZ PIII w/ 128M of RAM and 9G
of disk space)) has arrived.

This is going to change a lot of things, most notably our development and
authoring processes ...

During the next few days, we will be migrating Divunal over to the new
server, as well as the Divunal CVS tree.  We will be killing the old CVS
tree and re-checking everything in as a new set of modules -- our build
process is going to be completely re-done using Makefiles (the build
scripts were getting a little messy, as the project is relatively large
now).

In the interim, we will also be cleaning up the package structure and a
few function and class-naming issues which have arisen.  The new codebase
should be a lot cleaner and easier to work with.

If possible, we would like to separate the Twisted Reality and Divunal
source trees, so we can have developers of other games get access to the
CVS server (and perhaps even store their code there, in equally carefully
separated modules!)

If anyone on any of these lists knows a lot about CVS or version control
software / UNIX administration in general, I'd love to hear your questions
or input on how things are going to work in the future on our systems.
Despite having run a project on it for so long, I'm fairly new to CVS, and
I'd like to know how to make the most of it (especially in separating
modules in a Java codebase.  I'm not too clear on how to do that.)

More news coming in the near future.  Thanks for listening!
