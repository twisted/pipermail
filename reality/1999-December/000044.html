<PRE>I can't seem to figure out what's wrong with this.  After hearing a report
of the Reality Faucet &quot;just working&quot; with NT, using the 'msfaucet.bat'
file, I decided it should be possible to do this on any IE 5 Windows
platform, considering that JView comes preinstalled.

I tried it on Windows and I can't seem to figure out what's going on!  No
matter what I do, if I use a recent build, I get a 'noclassdeffounderror'.
No line-numbers, only 'at twisted.reality.client.Faucet.main'.  (If I
enable the 'verbose stack traces' option, I get (Faucet.java) appended to
this.  Thanks microsoft =\)

Can anybody get it to work?  I'm playing with an old build now to see if I
can replicate this bizarre behavior (the working kind, I mean ^_^) but
it's still going to be a while to download, and I can't see any relevant
differences (on the UNIX side at least)

Thanks,

The Tao is like a glob pattern:             It is masked but always present.
used but never used up.                     I don't know who built to it.
It is like the extern void:                 It came before the first kernel.
filled with infinite possibilities.         [<A HREF="mailto:glyph@twistedmatrix.com">glyph@twistedmatrix.com</A>]
