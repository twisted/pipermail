Yipe!  Yes, we know!  When we were testing this release, it turns out we
weren't actually testing the same code that got into the archives!  There
are quite a few bugs, and also some code we didn't intend to release
*cough* divunal *cough* in copies of the archives there.  We'd really
appreciate it if you'd delete that directory without looking at it. =)  
If you're not going to be playing the game, you're welcome to poke at it
to learn stuff about TR, provided that you agree to the authoring
agreement at <A HREF="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/agreement.html">http://www.twistedmatrix.com/agreement.html</A> and publicly
state that you do on one of the mailinglists here...

A 'brown-paper-bag' release is going to be coming out quickly (archives
have already been updated for the packaging error) -- there were quite a
few other bugs, too.  I wouldn't recommend playing with the 1.2.0 release
too much, actually -- a lot of stuff is broken, and most of it is just
silly one-line fixes that will be in 1.2.1, due out ASAP :).

Thanks for the bug report though; it shows us that somebody's paying
attention =)

The Tao is like a glob pattern:             It is masked but always present.
used but never used up.                     I don't know who built to it.
It is like the extern void:                 It came before the first kernel.
filled with infinite possibilities.         [<A HREF="mailto:glyph@twistedmatrix.com">glyph@twistedmatrix.com</A>]
