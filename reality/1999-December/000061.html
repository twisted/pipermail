Wow, cool!  Yes, complete removal of the hackage is the Right Thing to do.
I intentionally put it in as cruft 'cause it was easier than dealing with
a JTree at the time =).  Make a verbose entry in the changelog and we'll
mark the next release as a Big Deal for the faucet.

(This should significantly reduce the amount of weird updating crap too,
right?)

Thanks a lot; this one was a long time in coming.

The Tao is like a glob pattern:             It is masked but always present.
used but never used up.                     I don't know who built to it.
It is like the extern void:                 It came before the first kernel.
filled with infinite possibilities.         [<A HREF="mailto:glyph@twistedmatrix.com">glyph@twistedmatrix.com</A>]
