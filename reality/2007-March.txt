Subject: [Reality] Problems starting Imaginary
Message-ID: <200703211951.04911.Marcos.Marado@sonae.com>

Greetings,

I had on my TODO list to check out "Twisted Reality", and I decided to do it 
today. By the archives on this mailing list I noticed that Reality is now 
actualy Imaginary: http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodImaginary . Since I 
found no other reference to this, I think this is still the mailing list 
where I should write. 

The wiki tells me to read this file:

$ cat doc/RUNNING
================ <result of cat
$ axiomatic -d imaginary.axiom offering install imaginary
$ axiomatic -d imaginary.axiom start
$ telnet localhost 4023
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
IMAGINARY 0.1.0alpha0
TWISTED SVN-Trunk
PYTHON 2.4.2 (#2, Sep 30 2005, 21:19:01)
[GCC 4.0.2 20050808 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.0.1-4ubuntu8)]

================ result of cat />

So, I tried:

$ axiomatic -d imaginary.axiom offering install imaginary
Unknown command: offering
$

Anyone can point to me what am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advance,

It looks like you probably don't have the right versions of all the
dependencies.  Even if you did, though, it looks like the running document
is a bit out of date and skips a couple required steps.

I created a ticket in the Divmod tracker for this.  In the mean time, once
you get the latest version of everything, make sure to run this command
first:

    axiomatic -d imaginary.axiom mantissa

And after you run the start command, log in to the web server running on
localhost:8080 and configure a port number for either the telnet or ssh
server for imaginary.  Then you should be able to log in.
