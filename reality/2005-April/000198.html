<PRE>Hello, I am new to the list and to Imagination, but I am interested in 
Imagination.
I have written a couple of MUD servers from scratch in Python and came 
across this, thinking it might be a nice starting point for a new 
server.

I fiddled with it for about two days and could not figure out how to 
get it working.
I kept getting errors trying to run the various files, so I would try 
to find the modules that were missing or make minor code changes to see 
if i could get it running, but no dice.

Is there any documentation for the project? I found only minimal 
explanations of the theory of the library, not &quot;how to run it.&quot;

I'd be interested to live chat with someone who is familiar with 
Imagination, if someone wants to.
my AIM is ferggo, or MSN is <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/reality">ferggo at hotmail.com</A> (if anyone actually uses 
MSN)

Thanks, I'd love to see this project develop and would be happy to 
contribute, but I can't seem to figure out how to see it running.

</PRE>
