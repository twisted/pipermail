  Not so much.  The project is still in a state where getting a server to actually run is less important that other things (like having an actually working simulation core ;)  Alas, there is also not much time being spent on Imagination these days, due to requirements of other projects.

  In any case, to start up a server, you want to do something like this:

    <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/reality">exarkun at boson</A>:~/Projects/svn/Imagination/trunk/sandbox$ PYTHONPATH=~/Projects/svn/Twisted/trunk/:~/Projects/svn/Nevow/trunk/:~/Projects/svn/Imagination/trunk/  twistd -noy imagination.tac 

  Make sure you actually have <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/reality">trunk at HEAD</A> of Twisted and Nevow.

  Hopefully you'll be rewarded with a bunch of crud ending in some lines that talk about &quot;Starting factory ...&quot;  By default, you get a telnet server on port 4009, an ssh server on 4022, a web server on 4242, and a manhole server on 4010.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'd be interested to live chat with someone who is familiar with

</I>&gt;<i>my AIM is ferggo, or MSN is <A HREF="http://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/reality">ferggo at hotmail.com</A> (if anyone actually uses
</I>&gt;<i>MSN)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks, I'd love to see this project develop and would be happy to
</I>&gt;<i>contribute, but I can't seem to figure out how to see it running.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
  We hang out on IRC a bunch, irc.freenode.net, in #imagination.  The channel is quite frequently completely dead, but there are usually at least a few people idling there.  Be glad to chat with you some time.  I'm Jpswoogle on AIM, but I'm hardly ever actually on.

  Jp
