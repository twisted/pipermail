Hm.  I think I disagree.

Perhaps phrasing it in terms of combinations it seems that way, but the notion
of category-objects is very much a &quot;relationship of the code&quot;.  At the very
least, this is a development tools question: when we're adding reactivities to
the chemistry system, that seems like it's definitely somewhere that you should
be entering data into a knowledge base.  However, when we're adding wholly new
varieties of &quot;stuff&quot; to the game, you ought to be able to do that without
leaving emacs.

My opinion here comes from the fact that the prototype-based pseudo-inheritance
system in the old Reality was confusing and difficult to use.  If we have
in-game (or in-knowledge-base) representations of rules about the code itself,
then we have a database without which the code is nonsensical.  Moreover, the
code can *seem* to make sense, and we can have libraries that *seem* to use it,
but there are unseen knowledge-base assertions which are no longer being
verified, causing it to explode dramatically in the face of invalid input.
