Does an ILocationProxy get to know who's asking?  Seems as though properties 
of the actor would be important to deciding whether it's bright enough/too 
bright.

It sounds like (ha ha) this could be extended to support aural events, and 
perhaps even smision.  I reckon an ILocationProxy could, hypothetically with 
more work, ask its neighbours about noisy things (or in the case of smision, 
swaggy thing) and attenuate the decibel level?

Is there a place we can follow progress?  None of this seems to be in the SVN 
repository, or I'm just too stupid to use it properly.  Don't see changes 
more recent than &quot;3 weeks&quot;.

Mike.
