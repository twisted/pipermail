Subject: [Reality] where's the code?
Message-ID: <185aeadc0701122007g4b616b6jfc961b222bd08dd8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I'm trying to follow the directions on the web-site
(http://twistedmatrix.com/products/reality) to get a copy of the
codebase so that I can read through it and see what you folks are
working on.  It says the code is available through anonymous SVN in
the Imagination module...  but I can't seem to figure out what the SVN
repository path for that would be and I don't see any Imagination
module when floating through the web-based interface to the
repository.

Any help would be super!  Thanks!

/will

The code is now in the Imaginary directory in Divmod's svn repository.

To check it out, co http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/trunk/Imaginary

You'll need a bunch of other Divmod projects to run it, though, so you
might want to check out http://divmod.org/svn/Divmod/trunk instead.  Not
everything you'll get is necessary, but a lot of it is. :)

You can also browse this online at http://divmod.org/trac/browser/trunk/

Things have been quiet for a few months, I think we're gathering strength
for some kind of simulation time refactoring/cleanup.
