In a package like twisted.internet where the interfaces are all fairly 
narrow and have a large number of different implementors, this might 
make sense.  However, in NewReality, the interfaces are broad and 
typically only implemented once or twice, not to mention that they're 
tied to a particular domain.

Similarly, sometimes it makes sense to have a module like &quot;data&quot; in a 
package, if there are a few simple types and lots of functions that 
work on them elsewhere.  Usually it isn't such a good idea to separate 
your classes and functions into different modules, though.
