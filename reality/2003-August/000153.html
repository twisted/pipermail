Pretty much, yes. All of the adapter and interface logic is actually a
part of Twisted; Reality is just one of its most demanding use cases.

&gt;<i> For example, if I wanted to add the ability to speak to players, I'd

</I>&gt;<i> an adapter that implements that interface and register that adapter it

</I>&gt;<i> a Bugs Bunny-like Singing Sword, I could just register the same Say
</I>&gt;<i> adapter to an ordinary sword (thing with Weapon adapter).
</I>
This sounds right.

&gt;<i> This is probably a common complaint from someone not used to interface/
</I>&gt;<i> adapters, but one thing that sort of bothers me is that an objects's
</I>&gt;<i> adapters are registered in the adapter, not with the object.  For example
</I>&gt;<i> Actor is defined in things.py, but the Damagable interface is registered

</I>
This is the _whole point_ of adapters -- separating concerns so you
don't need to modify the original object to add functionality to it.
