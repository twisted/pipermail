In theory, extend the adapters.  I'm not sure how far this approach 
will scale, but I think it's safe to say it will scale more than any 
previously attempted approach :).

After all, I don't think it's possible to automate an interaction like 
&quot;how does burning interact with the function of a rope vs. the function 
of a loudspeaker vs. the function of a book?&quot;
