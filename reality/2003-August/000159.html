This is a convention that has been applied of and on in the Twisted
code-base (twisted.internet.interfaces, for example). I'm still not
sure what the best way to do it is.

Well, for one, this is an extremely generic piece of functionality
(for our target audience -- reality is all about being multiplayer :)
which definitely should be included anyway. For two, Reality will
probably have a good bit of system-specific stuff -- it *will* be just
a &quot;virtual world *engine*&quot;, but we learned from Python that a strong
standard library is an *excellent* thing to have.

Anyway, how does your MultiPlayerTextServer do its authentication? 
Does it use the (new) APIs in twisted.cred?
