This is quite cool, and overall IMHO the right direction to go (similar to
Aspect Programming, and a good use for it).  However, it is also very
ambitious...

Abitious enough that there is still going to be a fair amount of local
complexity (just how does a rope burn?  How do stretching, cutting, and
climbing interact?  Is a knotted rope easier to climb? etc.). This complexity
may mostly be in the form of data fields, but probably some methods as well.

How do you deal with such methods?  Do you place them on what needs them and
call them via reflecteion, or do you extend the adaptors to keep track of
all such complex interactions (if so what about code dealing with
interactions between 2 adaptors)?

Curious,
-Jasper
