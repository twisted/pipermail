Okay, fair enough.  After staring at code for a long time, I think the
light is finally starting to dawn (however dimly =) Now the thing that
sort of bothers me is the way interfaces and adapters are combined in
single modules.  Would it be cleaner and clearer if interfaces were all
defined somewhere (reality/interfaces/* ?) and the adapters somewhere
else?

Should I send in patches?  For example, I subclassed wiring.TextServer
to deal with multiple player logins (to the prosaically named
'MultiPlayerTextServer').  Or is this the sort of system-specific change
that doesn't need to be distributed?

Eric
