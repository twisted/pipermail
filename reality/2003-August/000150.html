Well, if you want to experiment with NewReality, you're going to need 
to be a little braver than with most MOO code :).  It's not really in a 
self-consistent state yet; we haven't, for example, hooked up any real 
notion of &quot;user authentication&quot; yet.

However, I can recommend the excellent paper by Allen Short (and, 
nominally, myself), &quot;Twisted Reality: A Flexible Framework for Virtual 
Worlds&quot;, which was presented at PyCon 2003 in DC this year.  It should 
at least give you a good idea of where we're trying to go.

If you're looking to set up a small playground to test stuff out in, 
'python sandbox/nettest.py' produces a server which listens on 8888 for 
telnet connections.  (Nominally it also listens on 8088 for web 
connections but that code was written against an early prototype of 
woven and no longer works.)
