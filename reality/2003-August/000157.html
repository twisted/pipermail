Heh, fair enough.  I certianly haven't seen a better way to handle such a
hard problem.

This is pure conjecture, but I wonder if some vague sort of &quot;meta&quot; adaptor
arrangement might help.  Something to formalize interaction between adaptors,
e.g. adaptors themselves registering with other adaptors, style rules for
composite adaptors, etc.  This sort of problem feels like a prime source
of complexity, and worth considering.

I have only a fuzzy notion of what this might be like of course.

Fortunately one probably doesn't need to go so far to have an interesting
environment. ;-)


On a side note, do you consider Twisted Reality to be a pet project, or
part of some long term goal?  I.e is it just for amusement and introspection,
or do you have plans to use it seriously?
