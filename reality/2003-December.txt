I used to have Twisted and Reality set up at home until I ran out of time to 
spend on such projects. I now find I have some time again. Alas, I can't 
find the code on account of I probably deleted it at some stage.

When I download Twisted 1.1.1 and the stuff in the Reality downloads area 
(inheritance and trdemo) is there some kind soul who can help me set this 
up?

Cheers,
Phrater Phil

Refer to this thread:

   http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/reality/2003-August/thread.html

the sandbox/ contains demo stuff. TRDemo and Inheritance haven't been 
ported to NewReality.

In particular, glyph's first response is the most relevant answer to 
your question "is there some kind soul who can help me set this up?" :)
