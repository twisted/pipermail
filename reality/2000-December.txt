Just writing to test if the mailinglist is still working after all this
time, and to alert you all that Twisted Reality in action.  Twisted Matrix
Enterprises is recently renamed Twisted Matrix Laboratories, since I don't
plan on working on any commercial products in the near future.

http://www.twistedmatrix.com/~glyph/py is where you will find the newest
and coolest, or in your friendly local CVS repository at /cvs.

Hey that stuff is really cool. :) I dunno how to login with the 
multiplayer server though. The documentation-mentioned 
username/password doesn't actually work and I'm too unfamiliar with 
it all to figure out how to frob the password field in the mapfile to 
a encoded version of a password known to me.

Also I'm kinda boggled at the number of different format transitions 
the mapfile goes through before being able to be loaded by the 
server. I get the difference between source and runnable binary but I 
don't understand how the spl stuff is useful.

The amount of functionality available in those packages with the 
amount of code there is really impressive though.

Damn I gotta learn python sometime. :)

Glad you're still reading / you still care / it doesn't suck :)

Oops.  The documentation should be updated to note that it's "admin", not
"Admin".  The encoded password is just md5 hashed, so
'md5.new('Foobar').digest()' will get you what you want.

OK; so you generate the map based off of the source code, then you
generate a saved *server set* based on that map.  When I say "set", you
should note that this includes a webserver.  All 'Serve.py' does is load
up a pickle and call '.run()' on the object returned.  The characters in
your multiplayer game can configure the webserver.  The .rpl is just a
map, the .spl is a set of servers, one of which happens to include map.  
Eventually this distinction will be moot when Kimchi gets to a really
usable state (and we have enough state in the world to justify using it)

Again, glad you appreciate it.  We (william short and I) are currently
working on a transition from the verb_/ability_ system to something
slightly more abstract, involving requests for actions from the players.  
Work is being kinda busy right now, so I don't know when I'm going to get
to finishing it.

Everybody should. :)

I guess the mailing list still works :)
