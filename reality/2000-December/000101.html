Hey that stuff is really cool. :) I dunno how to login with the 
multiplayer server though. The documentation-mentioned 
username/password doesn't actually work and I'm too unfamiliar with 
it all to figure out how to frob the password field in the mapfile to 
a encoded version of a password known to me.

Also I'm kinda boggled at the number of different format transitions 
the mapfile goes through before being able to be loaded by the 
server. I get the difference between source and runnable binary but I 
don't understand how the spl stuff is useful.

The amount of functionality available in those packages with the 
amount of code there is really impressive though.

Damn I gotta learn python sometime. :)
