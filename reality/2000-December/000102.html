Glad you're still reading / you still care / it doesn't suck :)

Oops.  The documentation should be updated to note that it's &quot;admin&quot;, not
&quot;Admin&quot;.  The encoded password is just md5 hashed, so
'md5.new('Foobar').digest()' will get you what you want.

</I>
OK; so you generate the map based off of the source code, then you
generate a saved *server set* based on that map.  When I say &quot;set&quot;, you
should note that this includes a webserver.  All 'Serve.py' does is load
up a pickle and call '.run()' on the object returned.  The characters in
your multiplayer game can configure the webserver.  The .rpl is just a
map, the .spl is a set of servers, one of which happens to include map.  
Eventually this distinction will be moot when Kimchi gets to a really
usable state (and we have enough state in the world to justify using it)

&gt;<i> The amount of functionality available in those packages with the 
</I>&gt;<i> amount of code there is really impressive though.
</I>
Again, glad you appreciate it.  We (william short and I) are currently
working on a transition from the verb_/ability_ system to something
slightly more abstract, involving requests for actions from the players.  
Work is being kinda busy right now, so I don't know when I'm going to get
to finishing it.

&gt;<i> Damn I gotta learn python sometime. :)
</I>
Everybody should. :)

I guess the mailing list still works :)
