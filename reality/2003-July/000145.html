It's TargetAction.  All actions have certain &quot;slots&quot; that have to be 
filled, and each slot has a corresponding interface.  For TargetAction, 
those slots are Place, Target, and Actor.  You can see this defined 
with the attribute 'interfaceTypes' in reality.actions.TargetAction.

However, those interfaces will not be created if they are already 
defined, if you want to make the code easier to read, and they are all 
defined in such a way that they will properly have documentation 
generated from them if you use a run-time documentation generator such 
as epydoc.  I'd recommend playing with epydoc at least once over the 
NewReality codebase to get a feel for everything that's generated.
