<PRE>I'm parsing in the socials from a text file and storing them in a
dictionary (Socials.socials, indexed by name, of course).  IIUnderstandC,
I need to put an action() function in socials.py, which will be executed
as if it were a verb.  Here's what I'm wondering:

1) Since the socials are being held in their own dictionary, how will the
game know to call the socials &quot;verb&quot; when someone calls, say, &quot;bite&quot;?  Or
will &quot;socials&quot; be called whenever the given verb can't be found?

2) Should I throw an InappropriateVerb exception or a NoVerb exception if
the requested social doesn't exist?

3) Should the action() method be inside the Socials class, or outside it?
Is this true for all verbs?

I was thinking originally that the socials dictionary would be part of the
given reality, e.g. self.socials = Socials(&quot;socials.txt&quot;), and it could
then be referenced by whatever does the verb checking, so that the socials
stuff isn't run unless the requested one actually exists.

I hope I haven't been too confusing.  Thanks in advance for your help.
