Minor correction: python parses glade's XML save format.

Yes, I considered using it -- after all, we had the interface defined
already in the C version using glade... I even read in the interface file
and instantiated some stuff (pyglade is cool...).  However, it's not
really worth it for an interface as small as the faucet (look at
gtkfaucet.py; it would probably be MORE work to do that interface
graphically again) and secondly, I thought it would be good if Dave and I
got more familiar with the GTK API for actually building GUIs, as it
would be nice to send little 'applets' over the wire to the client ... and
we would probably need to design a small GUI API (which would likely have
to overlay Tk, Gtk, and maybe even something else) to allow the python
scripts that get sent to the client to be relatively cross-platform.

If only the damned dynamic-theme stuff worked right, I'd be really gung-ho
to just scrap that idea and use glade and use gtk on both win32 and linux,
even if it meant I had to help develop glade for win32 =)

Which reminds me, I have to write that nasty C preamble that will allow
the gtk faucet in python to use themes...
