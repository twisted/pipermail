Okay.  I draw your attention to lines 280-290 of protocol.py:


	def __init__(self):
		self.commands={CMD_Hears: self.hear,
				CMD_SetName: self.name,
				CMD_DescAppend: self.describe,
				CMD_SetTheme: self.theme,
				CMD_DescClear: self.desc_clear,
				CMD_ListClear: self.list_clear,
				CMD_Exits: self.exits,
				CMD_ListAdd: self.list_add,
				CMD_ListRemove: self.list_remove,
				CMD_CompletedAction: self.reactivate}

I'd say that that little snippit fairly clearly defines an interface,
wouldn't you? ;-)

I don't think that the data would be useful; as I said in my last email,
each GUI is going to have to store the data in a different format,
especially if there's going to be tree or other list-type widget being
used for the item display stuff.  The only thing that might be useful is
the description handling.

&gt;<i> The point of this is to make it easier to develop Faucets--the only thing
</I>&gt;<i> one has to do is write the GUI code.
</I>
It's pretty close to that right now, looking at what we've got... maybe it
could be better documented...

&gt;<i> As far as merging Faucet.py with FaucetProtocol, I'm a bit leery of that
</I>&gt;<i> b/c the protocol implies the means by which the Faucet interacts with the
</I>&gt;<i> Pump, rather than how the Faucet operates internally.
</I>
I guess, but the distinction seems academic to me.  Is there ever
somewhere you'd want to use a Faucet protocol without using a Faucet?

&gt;<i> Does this clear things up?
</I>
a bit.
