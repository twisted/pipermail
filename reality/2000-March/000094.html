Perhaps the source of your confusion is that there is no such thing as a
&quot;player&quot;.  A player is just a Thing that happens to be connected to a User
(a User being an authentication object, not something that has to do with
the game directly, except for controlling and recieving input...)

Mike, just read core.py; the documentation isn't great, but the python
certainly isn't obfuscated.  A cursory glance through the event handling
code (even just searching or grepping for &quot;event&quot; in core.py) would have
revealed the following;

&gt;<i> def event(ev,th):
</I>&gt;<i> 	th.hears(ev.origin,' says, &quot;',ev.data,'&quot;.')
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;th&quot;?  What kind of thing is that?  Looks like a player, but I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> seen any comments, or any documented references....
</I>
core.py:597

	def handleEvent(self,event,data=None,origin=None,delay=0):
		&quot;Handle an event on this object, if a proper handler exists.&quot;
		if delay:
			dl = DelayedEvent(event,data,origin,self,delay)
			self.getReality().insertEvent(dl)
		else:
			x=self.getHandler(event)
			if not x is None:
				e=Event(event,data,origin)
				x.event(e,self)
				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I will give you one guess as to what type the object 'self' is in that
context.
