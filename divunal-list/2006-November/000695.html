<PRE>Variant for slow risers: The early worm gets eaten by the birds. Politics makes strange bedfellows. It's a good horse that never stumbles. Never put off till (until) tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow. All things come to he who waits.
Boys will be boys. Possible Interpretation: Do not look for faults in a something recieved as a gift. You can't judge a book by its cover.
Before criticizing a man, walk a mile in his shoes. Possible Interpretation: A person cannot be told what to do in his own house. Curiosity killed the cat. The end justifies the means.
Possible Interpretation: Women do not like the nice guys. Where's there's muck, there's brass A word spoken is past recalling. Hair of the dog that bit you. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Haste makes waste.
And drinking largely sobers us again. Variant for slow risers: The early worm gets eaten by the birds. Practice does not make perfect but a perfect practice makes perfect. While the cat is away, the mice will play.
Good eating deserves good drinking. From the Latin, de gustibus non est disputandum. There are no small parts, only small actors. Nature, time, and patience are three great physicians. A penny saved is a penny earned. Ben Franklin
