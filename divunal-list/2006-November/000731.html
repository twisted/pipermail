<PRE>He who laughs last laughs best Meaning: Admit it when there is some good in an adversary Rules are made to be broken Kill not the goose that laid the golden egg Don't make a mountain out of a molehill
It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all Beauty is only skin deep, but ugliness goes straight to the bone It takes two to lie, one to lie and one to listen
It pays to pay attention Fine words butter no parsnips The end justifies the means Variant: A bird in the hand makes it hard to blow your nose
Possible Interpretation: Here talks means carries weight, in the sense that it is influential Possible interpretation: Everyone's tastes are different Possible Interpretation: If something is good for one person, it is good for everyone; Many a mickle makes a muckle It pays to pay attention Software and Sex are good, when they are free
If wishes were horses Migs would fly Clothes make(th) the man From Sandy Elsberg's BREAD WINNER BREAD MAKER; Upline Press, Charlottesville, VA; 1977, p 80 Variant: Always look on the bright side of life
Variant paraphrase: All that glitters is not gold Alternate version: In for a dime, in for a dollar The head and feet keep warm, the rest will take no harm Never do today what you can put off till (until) tomorrow  Damned if you do, damned if you don't
