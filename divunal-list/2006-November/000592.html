<PRE>elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an&lt;BR&gt;but nothing to give him any alarm. i am so grieved for him! his behaviour was attentive and kind to&lt;BR&gt;&quot;well,&quot; said charlotte, &quot;i wish jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him&lt;BR&gt;elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave&lt;BR&gt;&quot;my object then,&quot; replied darcy, &quot;was to show you, by every civility in my power, that i was not&lt;BR&gt;disposition, your goodness, i never can have your happiness. no, no, let me shift for myself; and,&lt;BR&gt;blessing which few can boast. you see on what a footing we are. you see how continually we are&lt;BR&gt;charlotte is an excellent manager, i dare say. if she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving&lt;BR&gt;be miserable to forfeit it. my father, however, is partial to mr. wickham. in short, my dear aunt, i&lt;BR&gt;&quot;to oblige you, i would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by&lt;BR&gt;circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own&lt;BR&gt;between darcy and his companion. the perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his&lt;BR&gt;&quot;not as you represent it. had she merely dined  with him, she might only have discovered&lt;BR&gt;a young person well placed out. four nieces of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through&lt;BR&gt;&quot;the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. from their infancy, they have been&lt;BR&gt;away. march was to take elizabeth to hunsford. she had not at first thought very seriously of going&lt;BR&gt;&#215;are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used. it needed all jane's steady&lt;BR&gt;acquaintance during your stay at lambton?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;my love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?&quot; said her aunt; &quot;a&lt;BR&gt;agreeable-allowing something for fortune and figure.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton. she answered in the affirmative,&lt;BR&gt;circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their own&lt;BR&gt;comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of&lt;BR&gt;
