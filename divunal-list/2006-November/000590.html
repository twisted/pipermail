<PRE>early trees. she was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman&lt;BR&gt;&quot;it taught me to hope,&quot; said he, &quot;as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. i knew&lt;BR&gt;as to what is to be done.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. it could&lt;BR&gt;&quot;i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. as it principally&lt;BR&gt;&quot;yes, ma'am, all.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;we never had any governess.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the&lt;BR&gt;breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she&lt;BR&gt;&quot;not at all,&quot; was her answer; &quot;but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest&lt;BR&gt;&quot;i wonder,&quot; said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, &quot;whether he is likely to be in this&lt;BR&gt;&quot;i must go instantly to my mother;&quot; she cried. &quot;i would not on any account trifle with her&lt;BR&gt;daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly&lt;BR&gt;believing her indifferent is certain-but i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not&lt;BR&gt;always bordering on the uncivil, and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than&lt;BR&gt;&quot;i have not the smallest objection to explaining them,&quot; said he, as soon as she allowed him to&lt;BR&gt;&quot;i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. if it was not for the entail, i should&lt;BR&gt;condescension, and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service&lt;BR&gt;&quot;i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the appearance  of it as you used to do.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;
