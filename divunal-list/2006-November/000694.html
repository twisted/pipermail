<PRE>Make love, not war. Idle hands are the devil's playthings. Alternate: If at first you don't succeed, give up; it probobly isn't worth doing also, It takes all kinds to make the world go round. Who keeps company with the wolves, will learn to howl.
Possible Interpretation: Do not take on more responsibility than you can handle at any one time. You can't milk a cow with your hands in your pants. Don't exaggerate small things.
A miss by an inch is a miss by a mile. Software and Sex are good, when they are free. The wish is father to the thought. Humorous Alternative: To err is human; to blame it on someone else shows mangement potential
People who live in glass houses shouldn't play golf. Hair of the dog that bit you. Never do today what you can put off till (until) tomorrow . Possible Interpretation: One can get more cooperation from others by being nice. We are all in this together. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.
Why worry? If you worry - you die. If you don't worry - you'll still die. So why worry? Great oaks from little acorns grow. Alternately, If it ain't broke, don't fix it. A poor workman blames his tools.
Butter is gold in the morning, silver at noon, lead at night. Knowledge is power. If your problem has a solution, why to worry. If your problem doesnt have a solution, why to worry Possible Interpretation: Do not rush into what you do not know. Red sky at night: shepherd's delight. Red sky in the morning: shepherd's warning.
