<PRE>Fine words butter no parsnips Alternative: Red sky at night: sailor's delight Red sky in the morning: sailor take warning He that lives too fast, goes to his grave too soon Politics makes strange bedfellows All for one and one for all From &quot;The Three Muscuteers&quot; of Alexandre Dumas pere
Jack is as good as his master No man can serve two masters It's a blessing in disguise
Just do it! (Nike slogan) Set a thief to catch a thief Different sores must have different salves Power attracts the corruptible -from Dune series, Frank Herbert
A fox smells its own lair first and A fox smells its own stink first Diseases come on horseback, but steal away on foot A reference to the Trojan Horse Never say die Kill two birds with one stone A closed mouth catches no flies
To kill two birds with one stone Don't take any wooden nickels Our greatest glory is not in never falling but in rising everytime we fall --Confucius You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
Because then you are a mile away and you have his shoes There is only eight years been success and failure in politics -Jim Brown, Louisiana statesman Long absent, soon forgotten Red sky at night: shepherd's delight Red sky in the morning: shepherd's warning A beer a day keeps the germs away
