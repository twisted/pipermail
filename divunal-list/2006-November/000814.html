<PRE>Alert! Watch this one Soar!

Equipment &amp; Systems Engineering, Inc. (EQSE)

Sector: Environmental Engineering
Rating: VERY Bullish
Current Price:  $0.062
Projected:        $0.20

This is THE pick for the fourth quarter.  Environmental 
stocks are getting incredible exposure and taking off as 
governments and companies realize they need to start 
investing NOW.  EQSE is involved in high tech solutions for 
both the problems we face today and those of the future.

Search your favorite financial information site and become 
a believer.  This is HOT!

An earth shattering release is expected out of the company 
any day.  With all of EQSE's governmental contacts we are 
expecting a major contract announcement.  This issue is 
VERY tightly held and the release is going to push it up 
rapidly.  Don't delay.  It's not going to stop till we see 
20 cents!
