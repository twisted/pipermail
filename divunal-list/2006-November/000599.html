<PRE>as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing&lt;BR&gt;&quot;'my motive for cautioning you is as follows. we have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady&lt;BR&gt;&quot;thank you,&quot; said lydia, &quot;for if you did, i should certainly tell you all, and then wickham would&lt;BR&gt;clear the one without involving the other.&lt;BR&gt;difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.&lt;BR&gt;consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. it gave her all the animation that&lt;BR&gt;a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.&lt;BR&gt;close it with a call at the parsonage. are you going much farther?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;been removed.&lt;BR&gt;&quot;you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has&lt;BR&gt;&quot;my dear lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;there is a gentleman with him, mamma,&quot; said kitty; &quot;who can it be?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the&lt;BR&gt;&quot;how can you talk so?&quot; said jane, faintly smiling. &quot;you must know that though i should be&lt;BR&gt;&quot;when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, i shall hope to receive a&lt;BR&gt;&quot;yes, very different. but i think mr. darcy improves upon acquaintance.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;had you then persuaded yourself that i should?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;i do not at all know; but i heard  nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield. i hope&lt;BR&gt;&quot;and that  is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and mr. darcy would&lt;BR&gt;certainly am not. but he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man i ever saw-and if he&lt;BR&gt;&quot;but upon my honour, i do not . i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that .&lt;BR&gt;
