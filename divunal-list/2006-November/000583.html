<PRE>&quot;would you believe it, lizzy, that when he went to town last november, he really loved me, and&lt;BR&gt;away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.&lt;BR&gt;bennet from fighting. tell him what a dreadful state i am in, that i am frighted out of my wits-and&lt;BR&gt;been sometimes been found before, that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire&lt;BR&gt;elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and&lt;BR&gt;&quot;for heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. what advantage can it be for you to offend mr. darcy?&lt;BR&gt;always contrived to learn some from their aunt. at present, indeed, they were well supplied both with&lt;BR&gt;by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern-and the world in general would have&lt;BR&gt;ceremony of a formal invitation. bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking&lt;BR&gt;elizabeth. &quot;i should never have said mrs. collins was settled near  her family.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. they shook&lt;BR&gt;&quot;and then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;elizabeth almost stared at her. &quot;can this be mr. darcy?&quot; thought she.&lt;BR&gt;&quot;mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of&lt;BR&gt;discovered. i have seen them both-&quot;&lt;BR&gt;appearance created a great deal of surprise. that she should have walked three miles so early in the&lt;BR&gt;assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at&lt;BR&gt;&quot;i have been used to consider poetry as the food  of love,&quot; said darcy.&lt;BR&gt;and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manner towards&lt;BR&gt;arrival, elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. they were more disturbed,&lt;BR&gt;attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. i am truly glad, dearest lizzy,&lt;BR&gt;be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;
