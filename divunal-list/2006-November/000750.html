<PRE>Golf is a good walk spoilt Mark Twain Paddle your own  A picture is worth a thousand words There's always a deep breath before a plunge No time to waste like the present
The key to all action lies in belief People who live in glass houses have to answer the door As California goes, so goes the nation
Where there's a will, there's a relative ! Nothing ventured, nothing gained Nothing ventured, nothing gained He who hesitates is lost
All hat and no cattle The coat makes the man You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar Home is where the heart is This could also be read as, A friend in need is a friend in debt The wish is father to the thought
Hunger is the best spice If something is worth doing, then it's worth doing right People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones Without sleep, no health
Be careful what you wish for, you might just get it The early bird may catch the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese Steven Wright Doctors make the worst patients If you can't be good, be careful Never put off till (until) tomorrow what you can do today
