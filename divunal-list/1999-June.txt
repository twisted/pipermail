Subject: [Divunal-list] We Have Returned.

The Time Of Trouble has passed.

divunal.com is now a secure home for our email and website, as well as all
of the mailinglists (one of which is coming to you right as you're reading
this!)

This time, rather than the one quick hacked-up list, we are going to have
a set of multiple lists for different interest groups.

This group is divunal-list -- it's publicly subscribable and intended for
public discussion of what divunal is, and what it's supposed to be.
Please don't start bandying about plot or spoiler information on this
list.

There are two other lists (to which you may have been subscribed, or to
which you think you ought to have been): divunal-devel and divunal-author.
Ultimately, all authors should be developers at least in some respect, and
all developers should be authors also -- however, the types of discussions
developers and authors are willing to listen to differ greatly :-).

Our website is also up (http://www.divunal.com/) and contains quite a bit
of useful information.  I highly recommend you take a look at it: it
contains all of our new email addresses (before anybody asks, YES I am
available as maxwell@divunal.com)

Here's the list of hosts for our domain and what they do:

www.divunal.com:	web-service (obviously)
divunal.com:		mail and lists
reality.divunal.com	twisted.reality.Pump

clockwork.divunal.com	Dave's workstation
helix.divunal.com	Glyph's workstation

The machines that these represent are likely to be shuffled around a bit,
but what the hostnames indicate won't, so that's why I'm giving them to
you in this format :-)

Last but not least, thank you ALL for your patience and understanding
while we've been moving.  I sincerely apologize for the delays in
informing most of you what the situation was.  We are back online now and
you can connect with the faucet at your leisure.

Anyone who was on this list before, please remember that it is now a
*public* list, and therefore you shouldn't be discussing spoiler
information on it, only answering questions about what's going on.  Also,
it's not a development mailinglist, please direct programming traffic to
divunal-devel@divunal.com

New subscribers: please send us questions, I'm sure many of you have the
same ones... we'll be taking any relevant answers from this list and
putting them up as a FAQ as soon as we have a few.

Thanks everyone!

Here's a question: Is it possible that the design of the game engine could
be extended to provide a more interactive, visual interface? Something akin
to the current "3D" online multiplayer games. But better, of course ;)

Ciao,

[Disclaimer: If you want a purely technical answer, this isn't it.  Should
still be useful, though.  :-)]

	We've talked about this a few times, but it's nothing that we're
100% certain of doing any time, as far as I know.  I'm personally a big
fan of computer graphics, but I question whether going graphical would be
in the best interest of Divunal.  Time, resource, and design (1st person? 
3rd person isometric?  Both?)  issues aside, we can do a lot with text
that would be nigh impossible to do graphically.  The major benefit that
comes to mind is dynamically altering the world.  Right now, we can have
room descriptions that change while you're there, create items on the fly,
have players/items/etc. change the world in complex ways in-game, and
probably a bunch of other things that I haven't yet discovered.  (Someone
more familiar with the server needs to do a feature list.  James?) 
Replicating this in a graphical context would be mighty difficult, if not
impossible.  I remember being impressed by how Half-Life does bullet marks
in walls and such--we're capable of changing and saving much more about
the world if we use text.  To put it another way, our text interface is
*more* interactive than any graphical interfaces will be in the near
future.  (The wonderful irony of computer graphics: a few words can be
much more descriptive than a picture, due to hardware limitations.  Maybe
if we just do a Playstation 2 version....:-) )

	That said, I have to admit that it's certainly a cool idea, and it
might be that we can do it in a way so that the weaknesses of the
graphical environment have a negligible effect.  I'm definetely interested
in talking more about this, but a different venue may be more appropriate
if the discussion surpasses more than a couple of postings.  I can hear it
now: "We need to have a finished engine and a game before it's really
worth our time to talk about extending it.  Focus, focus, focus!"

	Which is right, of course.  :-)

A while ago in a much much earlier version (so much earlier that it was
labelled 1.0FC1! Haha FC1, that was a year and a half ago...anyways...),
there was a feature that let you set an image in place of the text in the
main description panel. That got taken out for some reason (probably
because it wasn't working or something) I personally would like to advocate
putting it back in a future version, along with Quicktime integration on
platforms that support it (mac & windows). This would allow you to play QT
movies to the player upon entering a room, or perhaps set a Quicktime VR
panorama movie as the picture for the scene and let the player look around.
All this is not a very tough extension to add to the server (a little
harder on the client though. :)). One thing pictures would be really useful
for is maps (ie from a map dealer). A textual map is just annoying...

The question about dynamicism are important however. Even though I know it
will happen, whenever a description changes all by itself when i'm just
sitting there I'm impressed. The completely dynamic (EVERYTHING can change
at runtime, including code) nature of this game is the best part, and
should be preserved at all costs. It is not particularly feasable to have
completely dynamic pictures. This game isn't a 3D walkaround, and I don't
think it ever will be. So, I think the best way to compromise is to have
objects have both a description, and an optional picture/movie. That
satisfies both the image-hungry consumers and the gamers. :) I believe
background music and sound is also planned, which can be accomplished with
either QT sound routines or another sound plugin. Anyways, none of this
will appear until after the first release, if we keep adding features,
it'll never get released. :)

Yeah, Dave & I have been sketching plans for a 3D version of the TR API (A
remarkable amount of stuff in TR is actually re-usable for 3D objects --
almost everything, actually) in our copious spare time :-) but I think
that it's best to focus on the here and now at least until Divunal is
really running (or at least somebody else takes TR and runs with it)

Agreed -- some things are better represented graphically.  The biggest
problem I see there is the ability to actually get the images to the
client.  I suppose we could use a webserver ... but then we'd need more
bandwidth, etc, etc... I guess if we're going to get images into the game
we just need to deal with that. *sigh*.

Well, with a little bit of editing, it would make a *wonderful* soundbyte.

The sfx and soundtrack stuff might be delayed a bit beyond the 1.0
release... just because I think it's ready for 1.0 right now...

I would like to set some sort of release-schedule for twisted.reality,
possibly move trask's site from www.tinaa.com over to
www.twistedmatrix.com/reality once we've got that site set up... I really
think it ought to be release 1.0 by the first of august.  I mean, enough
already with the 1.0 prereleases... the software is stable.  SPEAKING of
stable, everybody should take a look at the root page of divunal.com
tonight, I'm going to post an interesting little programming story about
fixing the last known crashing bug in the Pump...

Anyway, I'm off to be the wizard now... later

     We have discussed including graphics in some form, but we're focusing
on the main point of the Twisted Reality engine right now, which is to
produce an interactive text based environment. Any form of graphical
interface would be more of an afterthought on the TR engine (and on
Divunal) since we're relying on the many advantages that a text based
interface provides, and while the TR system would definitely make an
interesting base for a graphical 3D game, it would be an almost
completely new project, and we'd like to get Divunal done first.

     Graphics, after all, take up a lot of space, and are much more
difficult to create quickly... and it would take quite a bit of work to
make a game "more" interactive by virtue of being graphical. While I like
to believe that the video game industry trend to substitute pretty 3D
graphics for gameplay is a fad (or at least the kind of mistake it will
grow out of eventually), working with graphics becomes exponentially
more difficult when you add more degrees of interaction, and I can't
exactly blame game designers for slacking off in that department after all
the effort they've put towards making everything look pretty.  :-)

     So... While I agree that it would be cool to try to apply our
methodology to graphics, I can't see how that project could be any more
interactive than Divunal, and I know it wouldn't be nearly as easy to work
with. (Half Life is spectacularly interactive compared to a lot of other
games, and graphically beautiful, to boot... But aside from shooting and
reloading, your other degree of freedom is an ability to "activate"
things. Some of these things are interesting (artillery aiming systems,
gun turrets, and so on) but making something explode or deliver a piece of
canned dialog get sort of old after a while. In the relational-databased
world of Divunal, we can add a new form of interaction to everything in
the world at once... And we do it all the time, in a form that you can
interact with in plain english. As someone who's worked extensively with
the Quake/Quake2/HalfLife engines, that's really unheard of.

	Still, given the state of the art in "interactive" online games
(Everquest, various MUDs, etc.) I like to think we could manage to do
something comparatively impressive, if not as pretty looking.  :-)  

- Tenth

(PS: I don't mean to sound high and mighty about this, but try telling
John Carmack that he should consider adding a Text Only interface mode to
Quake 3 Arena to make it more exciting and violent, and see how he reacts.

First of all, thank you for responding to our web page, and our apologies
for the delay in getting back to you. We are interested in finding new
Authors, but before we officially "let you in", there are a few things you
should know about.

First, we request all of our authors and contributors to agree to a few
terms. You can find them on the Divunal site at:

	www.divunal.com/agreement.html

We'd like you to send us an email stating that you have read (and
agree to) the agreement. We'd rather not have to bring legality into this
project, but after a few nasty events recently, we have no choice. (See
the Agreement page for more information on this.) If you have any
questions or comments, feel free to email Glyph or myself... We're
flexible on most of these issues, and we'd be happy to discuss them with
you if legal stuff makes you uncomfortable.

If everything works out, we'll add you to the divunal-author mailing list,
give you access to the Author pages, discuss your God character (what a
God character is, if you want one or not), see about getting you a
Divunal t-shirt as soon as they are available, etc.  :-)

Once again, we'd be happy to discuss any concerns you have about the
Divunal project or our author's agreement, over email or on the #divunal
IRC channel, and we hope you find them satisfactory.

Thanks,

- Tenth

From: Mark Benvenuto ivymccough@worldnet.att.net
Subject: [Divunal-list] Security Considerations

    Public projects regardless of their status as Open Source or their
ambitions for commercial success must take into consideration security.
In the first days of the Internet, everyone was very open and security
was not a concern. The early IETF standards show this (POP, SMTP, FTP,
DNS, IPv4, TCP, UDP, etc.). The IETF is now taking security into
consideration for all of their current proposals and drafts. (SEC-DNS,
TLS, OpenPGP, S/MIME, IPSec, IPv6, SSH, etc.). Divunal should be know
different.
    The current strength of Divunal and Twisted Reality is the fact that
all of the objects and data files reside on the server along with all of
the commands and command validation. The principal weakness of the
current model is its openness. It uses a plain text protocol. It sends a
short int specifying the command, a byte specifying the number of
additional data entries, and then a series of byte and data pairs
containg the type of data and the actual data (byte array(length byte,
then data), string, or null. This is a very simply designing protocol
but it lacks security considerations. The users requests to the server
are public. Anyone potentially could read the data. They could alter it
by using known attacks or simply gain curcial data. They could be
provided with addtional information about the game or with the passwords
of the users. The passwords are particulary valuable as an attacker
could damage the came if he got a god account or damage an individual
user's account.
    Unfortunately, security cannot be adequately dealt with do to U.S.
export restrictions on strong cryptography. The easiest way to improve
security would be to use an SSL connection between the client and
server. This would increase the strain on the server unfortunately and
cannot be done by U.S. citizens because of export rules. For the time
being, this security problem must be lived with (maybe the U.S. will
drop the restrictions).
    A total security implementation cannot be attained but the security
of the password mechanism can be improved. The password is currently
sent in plain text across the connection and stored with
twisted.util.UnixCrypt. Following the Linux security model with PAM, it
should be stored in a hash such as MD5 or SHA-1. Both are more secure
and require no additional software then JDK 1.1+ (For the GTK+ version,
I can get an MD5 version for any license). Also, the password should be
sent over the connection in a hashed form. Following a model such as OTP
(rfc2289), a small challenge string should be sent with the LOGIN
message and then the password hash commputed by a command such as HASH(
challenge & HASH( password )) should be sent across from the client. The
server would take the stored password hash and challenge and execute
HASH( challenge & stored-password-hash )). The server would compare the
client generated with the server generated and if they match then allow
the client to login. This would be an improvement over the current model
as it prevents a plain text password from crossing the network and keeps
it stored in a secure form on the server.

pardon the interjection-

1) use SHA-1 ... according to rivest it is more secure and you'll have
less collisions.  its a pain to code by yourself, but oh well...  this
is legal, right?  i don't remember the laws for SHA-1...

2) why stop at only encrypting the password?  you may have a good
reason, but i couldn't pick it out from the e-mail.  

if you want to encrypt everything (if memory servers -- usual
disclaimers apply -- i'm not a cryptographer)....

 1. client sends the server the user name
 2. server sends back a nonce encrypted with the client's hashed password
 3. client hashes the password so he can decrypt the nonce
 4. use the nonce to encrypt all communications back and forth

my only complaint is that we are using an uniform key for the
communications.  make sure the nonce is generated by a good random
function that is time stamped.

oh well -- this is just a paranoia freak talking...

Yes. MD5 has problems I think in one phase. MD2 and MD4 are are even more
broken. SHA-1 is legal since it is distributed with the JDK1.1+.

Good idea (basic idea of SSL/TLS but with public key encryption) (could use
r2, r5, r6, IDEA, MARS, Blowfish, Twofish, etc). but impossible. See
Commercial Encryption Export Controls or  mozilla.org crypto faq . The mozilla
faq is quite detailed and should any answer questions. In short, you cannot
add public/private key or symmetric key encryption to this project because it
cannot be exported outside the U.S. You cannot even add in hooks for the
cryptography so someone could add it in later. If it was added, any downloads
containing cryptography would have to be validated that they are sent to a
U.S. citizen in the U.S.

Use long keys and a good random generator. JCE 1.2 has everything you will
need but see above.

Security people have to be paranoid.

Subject: [Divunal-list] please remember the description of this list

An appropriate flame has been posted to the appropriate list for those
interested in following (and participating in) the security discussion,
but this list really isn't the correct one for it.

reality@tinaa.com is the mailinglist for twisted reality development.

This may eventually move (perhaps even soon, depending on what the
hardware situation pans out to be 'round these parts), but right now we
are having enough troubles with the stuff we're running on our server ^_^)

Speaking of the topic of this list -- please send personal email to me
(glyph@divunal.com) if you want to see something like regular updates of
what's going on in Divunal and what our "ready" status is like on this
list.

Subject: [Divunal-list] Authorship Agreement

You may notice that people have been posting brief messages like, "I
agree, yah, sign me up".

This is because we've decided to use the mailinglist as a sort of informal
list of witnesses to someone agreeing to an authorship agreement, in lieu
of having an actual signature anywhere (which is pretty impractical in a
project carried out in this fashion).

We just want to make sure that it would be rediculous to try to claim that
you didn't agree if you did -- not that we don't trust people, but this
way agreeing to the agreement means something.

Just thought I'd clear that up as long as I was answering emails.  Thanks!

Subject: [Divunal-list] Reality Server Reorganization

Due to some problems with the Reality server (The computer itself, not the
software :-) we will be forced to take Divunal and the CVS tree offline
for a day or two (or three) while we work out a few issues and kick the
tower case a few times.

The Twisted Reality webpage may be moving soon as well when 
our new server arrives, but the end result will be that our 
formal Divunal page will be up at www.divunal.com, with more information
for prospective players, and the Twisted Reality/Twisted Matrix site will
actually be at www.twistedmatrix.com where it's supposed to be.

We'd like to apologize for the inconvenience this causes our developers,
(and the further delay this puts on players getting to try Divunal) and
thank you for bearing with us while we finish setting up our new office.

Thanks again,

- Tenth

     We don't really have very strict requirements as to how often or how
much authors should contribute; Generally speaking, we're more concerned
with maintaining the quality of the content that goes into the game than
we are with how much any one person produces. All authors will be able to
use the Divunal server for free, even when it becomes a commercial
game, and can create and play new characters at will. They may also
recieve other benefits (divunal t-shirts, etc.) if our commercial plans
work out, especially if they contribute a lot to the game, but we can't
really guarantee anything at this point.

	The biggest requirements we have are on behavior; We're trying
very hard to create a consistant game world, and we ask that Authors help
to maintain that and remain in character at all times. While authors are
free to play as many characters as they want, to help to advance the plot,
keep the players entertained, or just to have fun, but they must always
keep game consistancy in mind, and maintain a mature, polite, and
professional attitude at all times. Authors have more freedom in creating
new areas and features for the game, (there are certain contexts in which
the game world doesn't need to be as consistant and almost anything is
feasible) but we still want to maintain a high level of quality, and
balance the various features, items, and powers available to the players.

	So, in short, the biggest requirement is that we're very picky
about the quality of our game, and we reserve the right to censor or
correct our Author's work if we deem it necessary. All of our requirements
(including a few standard legal ones) are summarized at:

	www.divunal.com/agreement.html

	Which is the document you must agree to if you want to become an
Author. If you agree to all the terms listed there, and post an email to
that effect on the main divunal-list, we can let you into the author's
sections, and give you a special account on the server. You are under no
obligation to stay, but we do require that you keep the information you
recieve as an author confidential. (See the agreement page for more
information, and reasons why we have to make you sign an agreement.)

	If you can speak english, don't mind typing a lot, and can operate
a computer well enough to send and recieve email, you have all the basic
skill requirements for being an author.  :-)  Background in programming or
other online games is definitely helpful, but not required, and
creativity, patience, and serious interest in helping out is strongly
recommended. We are looking for good roleplayers and writers as well as
people who want to help out with maintain the game code itself.

	If you have any more questions about authoring or Divunal itself,
feel free to email me (or Glyph, or post more questions to the
Divunal-list).

Thanks,

- Tenth
