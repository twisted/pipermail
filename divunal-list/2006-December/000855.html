<PRE>You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs Those who play bowls must look out for rubbers Little things please little minds It's the early bird that gets the worm No time to waste like the present
Nor pot to piss out in (variant of neither a pot to piss in nor a window to throw it out) This was a referance to the high wages paid to garbage collectors at one time Alternate version: In for a dime, in for a dollar
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill When the cat's away, the mice will play A cat may look at a king Rome wasn't built in a day
He who pays the piper calls the tune Ne'er cast a clout till May be in Owt for nowt, and a penny change When the cat's away, the mice will play Attributed to Winston Churchill It's easier to turn falsehood loose than correct it everywhere it runs to Don't mend what ain't broken
Brain is better than brawn Nothing to be feared in life ,but understood All's fair in love and war A friend to all is a friend to none
Fine feathers make fine birds Lie down with dogs, wake up with fleas Desperate times call for desperate measures From the Christian New Testament Boys will be boys
