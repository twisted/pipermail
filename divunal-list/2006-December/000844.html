<PRE>A lie can be halfway around the world before the truth gets its boots on Vengeance is mine, thus sayeth the Lord If you want what you've never had, you must do what you've never done (Tito D) Nothing succeeds like success Don't make a mountain out of a molehill
Those who lost dreaming are lost A boiled egg in the morning is hard to beat You are responsible for you
Possible Interpretation: You can achieve something in a variety of methods He who dares wins (motto of the Special Air Service (aka SAS)) There's more than one way to skin a cat Corollary, cynical: He who laughs last, thinks slowest
Variant attributed to Hugh Hefner: &quot;No nudes is bad nudes&quot; Purely bluster and no substance Long experience of someone or something can make one so aware of the faults as to be scornful Brain is better than brawn There's no accounting for taste Stolen fruit is sweet
Patience is a virtue It's easy to be wise after the event Possible Interpretation: Never give up Christian New Testament
No pain, no gain Going the whole nine yards The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence People who live in glass houses shouldn't play golf A good beginning makes a good ending
