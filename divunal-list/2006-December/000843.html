<PRE>If mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy You can't take it with you All hat and no cowboy Hunger makes good kitchen You can lead (take) a horse to water but you can't make it drink
&gt;<i>From Sandy Elsberg's BREAD WINNER BREAD MAKER; Upline Press, Charlottesville, VA; 1977, p 80 Love is blind If you buy cheaply, you pay dearly
</I>Associated with Camapanology (Quotation from a Church belltower) All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy Lead to Success, Follow to Failure (Robert D) Ignorance is bliss
The wish is father to the thought There is no 'I' in TEAM Simple minds think alike (William Truong) Money talks Mine always says, Goodbye! - Hardy Parkerson In the Bible, John 8:32 Rule #1: Mom is always right Rule #2: If Mom is wrong, refer to rule #1
If three people tell you that you are drunk, you better lie down Meaning: Kind words/actions are more effective in bringing about an outcome than harsh ones Loose lips sink ships Loose lips sink ships
Where there's a will, there's a relative ! If you were born to be shot, you'll never be hung The pitcher goes so often to the well that it comes home broken at last Diseases come on horseback, but steal away on foot Interpretation: A person who is active will not grow stale
