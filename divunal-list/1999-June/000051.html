<PRE>You may notice that people have been posting brief messages like, &quot;I
agree, yah, sign me up&quot;.

This is because we've decided to use the mailinglist as a sort of informal
list of witnesses to someone agreeing to an authorship agreement, in lieu
of having an actual signature anywhere (which is pretty impractical in a
project carried out in this fashion).

We just want to make sure that it would be rediculous to try to claim that
you didn't agree if you did -- not that we don't trust people, but this
way agreeing to the agreement means something.

Just thought I'd clear that up as long as I was answering emails.  Thanks!
