<PRE>The Time Of Trouble has passed.

divunal.com is now a secure home for our email and website, as well as all
of the mailinglists (one of which is coming to you right as you're reading
this!)

This time, rather than the one quick hacked-up list, we are going to have
a set of multiple lists for different interest groups.

This group is divunal-list -- it's publicly subscribable and intended for
public discussion of what divunal is, and what it's supposed to be.
Please don't start bandying about plot or spoiler information on this
list.

There are two other lists (to which you may have been subscribed, or to
which you think you ought to have been): divunal-devel and divunal-author.
Ultimately, all authors should be developers at least in some respect, and
all developers should be authors also -- however, the types of discussions
developers and authors are willing to listen to differ greatly :-).

Our website is also up (<A HREF="http://www.divunal.com/">http://www.divunal.com/</A>) and contains quite a bit
of useful information.  I highly recommend you take a look at it: it
contains all of our new email addresses (before anybody asks, YES I am
available as <A HREF="mailto:maxwell@divunal.com">maxwell@divunal.com</A>)

Here's the list of hosts for our domain and what they do:

www.divunal.com:	web-service (obviously)
divunal.com:		mail and lists
reality.divunal.com	twisted.reality.Pump

clockwork.divunal.com	Dave's workstation
helix.divunal.com	Glyph's workstation

The machines that these represent are likely to be shuffled around a bit,
but what the hostnames indicate won't, so that's why I'm giving them to
you in this format :-)

Last but not least, thank you ALL for your patience and understanding
while we've been moving.  I sincerely apologize for the delays in
informing most of you what the situation was.  We are back online now and
you can connect with the faucet at your leisure.
