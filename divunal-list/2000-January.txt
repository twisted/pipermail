Subject: [Divunal-list] author index update

Hi everyone,
I'm back in MA with a reliable net connection! ya!

I've made the requested changes/additions to the author's index. I have
some time to work on this this week so if anyone needs has any other
changes, let me know :). Please check the author contact index (follow the
link off the main author's page) to see if there are any updates. 

Thanks,

Haley
