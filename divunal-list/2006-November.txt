The Shorts are out! The Gap is Good! Take advantage!

Company: Red Reef Laboratories
Symbol: RREF
Price: $0.215

RREF has been on a steady rise for a week with HUGE volume. Now the
shorts created a gap providing a second chance to get in on RREF.

It's $0.215, and will climb hard back to $0.40 by early next week.
Don't be the one that missed out be the one who rakes it in next
week. Grab RREF first thing Thursday morning.

RECENT NEWS (November 15, 2006 - 8:18 AM EST): 

Aduddell Industries, (OTCBB: ADDL) today reported its financial results for the three and nine month
periods ending September 30, 2006.

For the third quarter period, the Company reported revenues of $11.5 million, and net income of $18,133.
This compares with third quarter revenues and net income in the 2005 period of $34.7 million and $6.9
million respectively. Revenues and net income for the 2005 year third quarter were impacted by $28.7 million
in disaster response revenue. Aduddell Industries disaster services are affected by the presence or absence
of disaster related work. Revenues for Aduddell Industries core business increased 93%, from $6 million in
2005 to $11.5 million in 2006.

For the nine-month period ending September 30, reported revenues totaled $23.9 million with net income of
$90,601. This compares to revenues and net income in the same period for 2005 of $41.8 million and $6.7
million respectively. The decline in revenues and net income is primarily the result of the absence of disaster
response revenue in 2006 compared to 2005, however revenues for the company's core business were higher
as a result of increased sales resulting from the marketing initiatives implemented in 2006 and the additional
sales of $3.5 million brought by the new restoration division.

Don't remove winter vests (undergarments) until summer arrives. First deserve then desire.
And drinking largely sobers us again. Judge not, lest ye be judged.

Make love, not war. Idle hands are the devil's playthings. Alternate: If at first you don't succeed, give up; it probobly isn't worth doing also, It takes all kinds to make the world go round. Who keeps company with the wolves, will learn to howl.
Possible Interpretation: Do not take on more responsibility than you can handle at any one time. You can't milk a cow with your hands in your pants. Don't exaggerate small things.
A miss by an inch is a miss by a mile. Software and Sex are good, when they are free. The wish is father to the thought. Humorous Alternative: To err is human; to blame it on someone else shows mangement potential
People who live in glass houses shouldn't play golf. Hair of the dog that bit you. Never do today what you can put off till (until) tomorrow . Possible Interpretation: One can get more cooperation from others by being nice. We are all in this together. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.
Why worry? If you worry - you die. If you don't worry - you'll still die. So why worry? Great oaks from little acorns grow. Alternately, If it ain't broke, don't fix it. A poor workman blames his tools.
Butter is gold in the morning, silver at noon, lead at night. Knowledge is power. If your problem has a solution, why to worry. If your problem doesnt have a solution, why to worry Possible Interpretation: Do not rush into what you do not know. Red sky at night: shepherd's delight. Red sky in the morning: shepherd's warning.

Message-ID: <001401c70d1f$b7affda0$07774184@insider>

Variant for slow risers: The early worm gets eaten by the birds. Politics makes strange bedfellows. It's a good horse that never stumbles. Never put off till (until) tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow. All things come to he who waits.
Boys will be boys. Possible Interpretation: Do not look for faults in a something recieved as a gift. You can't judge a book by its cover.
Before criticizing a man, walk a mile in his shoes. Possible Interpretation: A person cannot be told what to do in his own house. Curiosity killed the cat. The end justifies the means.
Possible Interpretation: Women do not like the nice guys. Where's there's muck, there's brass A word spoken is past recalling. Hair of the dog that bit you. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Haste makes waste.
And drinking largely sobers us again. Variant for slow risers: The early worm gets eaten by the birds. Practice does not make perfect but a perfect practice makes perfect. While the cat is away, the mice will play.
Good eating deserves good drinking. From the Latin, de gustibus non est disputandum. There are no small parts, only small actors. Nature, time, and patience are three great physicians. A penny saved is a penny earned. Ben Franklin

He who laughs last laughs best Meaning: Admit it when there is some good in an adversary Rules are made to be broken Kill not the goose that laid the golden egg Don't make a mountain out of a molehill
It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all Beauty is only skin deep, but ugliness goes straight to the bone It takes two to lie, one to lie and one to listen
It pays to pay attention Fine words butter no parsnips The end justifies the means Variant: A bird in the hand makes it hard to blow your nose
Possible Interpretation: Here talks means carries weight, in the sense that it is influential Possible interpretation: Everyone's tastes are different Possible Interpretation: If something is good for one person, it is good for everyone; Many a mickle makes a muckle It pays to pay attention Software and Sex are good, when they are free
If wishes were horses Migs would fly Clothes make(th) the man From Sandy Elsberg's BREAD WINNER BREAD MAKER; Upline Press, Charlottesville, VA; 1977, p 80 Variant: Always look on the bright side of life
Variant paraphrase: All that glitters is not gold Alternate version: In for a dime, in for a dollar The head and feet keep warm, the rest will take no harm Never do today what you can put off till (until) tomorrow  Damned if you do, damned if you don't

Golf is a good walk spoilt Mark Twain Paddle your own  A picture is worth a thousand words There's always a deep breath before a plunge No time to waste like the present
The key to all action lies in belief People who live in glass houses have to answer the door As California goes, so goes the nation
Where there's a will, there's a relative ! Nothing ventured, nothing gained Nothing ventured, nothing gained He who hesitates is lost
All hat and no cattle The coat makes the man You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar Home is where the heart is This could also be read as, A friend in need is a friend in debt The wish is father to the thought
Hunger is the best spice If something is worth doing, then it's worth doing right People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones Without sleep, no health
Be careful what you wish for, you might just get it The early bird may catch the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese Steven Wright Doctors make the worst patients If you can't be good, be careful Never put off till (until) tomorrow what you can do today

Alert! Watch this one Soar!

Equipment & Systems Engineering, Inc. (EQSE)

Sector: Environmental Engineering
Rating: VERY Bullish
Current Price:  $0.062
Projected:        $0.20

This is THE pick for the fourth quarter.  Environmental 
stocks are getting incredible exposure and taking off as 
governments and companies realize they need to start 
investing NOW.  EQSE is involved in high tech solutions for 
both the problems we face today and those of the future.

Search your favorite financial information site and become 
a believer.  This is HOT!

An earth shattering release is expected out of the company 
any day.  With all of EQSE's governmental contacts we are 
expecting a major contract announcement.  This issue is 
VERY tightly held and the release is going to push it up 
rapidly.  Don't delay.  It's not going to stop till we see 
20 cents!
