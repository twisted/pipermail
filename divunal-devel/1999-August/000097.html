IMHO, this could be implemented using a 

&gt;<i>      However, note that word &quot;eventually&quot;.  :-)  While it is sort of
</I>&gt;<i> unfair to be totally unable to do anything if it's dark, it also makes
</I>&gt;<i> dark a lot less interesting if you're totally uninhibited by it. I guess a
</I>&gt;<i> middle ground (not being able to see, but still being able to refer to
</I>&gt;<i> things by name) would be nice, but I think it might be more interesting
</I>&gt;<i> (and not too terribly much more complicated, assuming you can get darkness
</I>&gt;<i> to work in the first place) if there was a chance that any attempts to
</I>&gt;<i> interact with other Things in the room might fail, and that the failure
</I>&gt;<i> was something along the lines of &quot;You blunder around in the dark.&quot; If you
</I>&gt;<i> _think_ you know where an object is, it might still take you a few
</I>&gt;<i> attempts to find it, and you wouldn't know immediately if it was gone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     And while combat isn't a big part of the game, darkness does make life
</I>&gt;<i> interesting. Ideally, like the interaction described above, you could
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to attack a specific person, but there would be a chance that you
</I>&gt;<i> would totally miss them in the dark, and wouldn't necessarily know if they
</I>&gt;<i> were still in the room or not. (You could even go as far as having a
</I>&gt;<i> chance of randomly attacking someone else by accident, but that's leaning
</I>&gt;<i> towards the much sillier and more complex side of things.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     And on this topic (sorry, this has gotten a lot longer than I wanted),
</I>&gt;<i> isn't it going to be difficult to distinguish between &quot;visible&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;audible&quot; actions? Our newly working perspectives feature could change
</I>&gt;<i> player names to &quot;someone&quot; in the dark, we can use the &quot;hidden&quot; boolean on
</I>&gt;<i> socials to determine if they work in the dark or not... But that still
</I>&gt;<i> leaves a lot of other miscellaneous effects. It would be safer just to say
</I>&gt;<i> that things other than non-hidden socials, speech, and special effects
</I>&gt;<i> that are directed at the player (being attacked, hearing telepathic
</I>&gt;<i> messages, etc.) don't show up in the dark, but that doesn't always work,
</I>&gt;<i> either. (You can't see Gates in the dark, but can you still hear the sound
</I>&gt;<i> of fabric rending?)  It's certainly a lot easier just to say that you
</I>&gt;<i> can't do much of anything in the dark...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Any ideas?
