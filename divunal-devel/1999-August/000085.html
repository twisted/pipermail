<PRE>'Lo, all.  I took some time today to look around the web to find
sites/publications/etc. on which I (or someone, at least) could announce
TR 1.1.  My list (a brain dump, not culled yet) is below, along with
Raffi's ideas for Mac places to tell.

I'd really like to hear people's suggestions; the more &quot;air time&quot; we can
get, the better.  Just keep in mind that even though there's a &quot;playable
demo&quot; (THANK YOU, DAVE!!!), it's really to showcase TR's features more
than what Divunal is like, so the main audience we're aiming for is
creators--developers and authors--not players/playtesters.  (And, of
course, anyone who wants to give us money.)

And please feel free to let people you know know about this; the press
release can be handy for sending out--that's what it's there for, after
all!

We'd also appreciate it if people could send in their thoughts regarding
TR for the quotes page.

Where *is* everyone?!
