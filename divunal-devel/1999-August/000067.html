Good, good.  All will be in readiness for a release, then :-)

</I>
No heart-attacks here... I've been making small changes to that effect
myself for a long while.  Thanks for making sure it works with an actual
1.2 JDK :-)

In fact, it was a pretty dumb idea for me to name LinkedList
&quot;LinkedList&quot;... I'm thinking of changing it to NaiveDictionary (since it's
hardly ever used as a LinkedList, and it's really not terribly efficient
at doing that.)

Is everything else A-OK for 1.2?

&gt;<i> Also, the map.por in resource used a few modules/classes not present in
</I>&gt;<i> the twisted.reality packages, namely twisted.reality.plugin.Tester and
</I>&gt;<i> twisted.reality.handler.PlayerSayHandler.
</I>
PlayerSayHandler was important -- it's been moved to
twisted.reality.plugin, though.  I've put it back in the map.

&gt;<i> However, there's another problem that has arisen, and that is that when
</I>&gt;<i> the player &quot;You&quot; logs in, its location is null, since there's no other
</I>&gt;<i> players to grab &quot;You&quot; this is kind of a problem.
</I>
Replacing player is no longer a task of the engine.  In the interest of
putting more hooks in to customize the game's behavior, you're not moved
back to your oldlocation when you log in -- you're given the event
&quot;login&quot;.  Ditto for logout.  Default login / logout handlers (in
twisted.reality.plugin) emulate the old behavior.  I've fixed the map for
this.

&gt;<i> I've checked the map, and oldlocation is valid. Any ideas?
</I>
Check the map one more time, run a stock TR again, and let's see what
happens.  It should all work now.
