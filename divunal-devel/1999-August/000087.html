Tasteful color IMO would be in the action panel, not the description
panel. While the description could maybe use some spicing up from use
of bold and italics, it probably would not be helped much (or at all)
by color. On the other hand, I think the action could. E.g. 

&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,0000,FFFF&lt;/param&gt;&gt; say &quot;Hello.

&lt;/color&gt;You say: &quot;&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;FFFF,0000,0000&lt;/param&gt;Hello.&lt;/color&gt;&quot;

Tenth says: &quot;&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;FFFF,0000,0000&lt;/param&gt;Hello James.&lt;/color&gt;&quot;

&lt;color&gt;&lt;param&gt;0000,0000,FFFF&lt;/param&gt;&gt; go south

&lt;/color&gt;You go south.


or something like that.


This is generally how it is used in 'inferior' M*s and I have to say
that it really does help to keep players from having their eyes glaze
over at a screenfull of text.


But anyhow, I'm gonna implement it, (along with basic styles) in the
server and java client, so hopefully someone will find an approved use
for it. :)
