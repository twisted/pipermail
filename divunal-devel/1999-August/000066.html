<PRE>I tried to compile a local copy of TR (just as a developer might if
they were interested in the platform), and I found a few minor snafus.

First of all, I made a minor change to twisted.reality.Age so it's 1.2
compatible (now, before Glyph has a heart attack, it wasn't anything
severe) -- the import statements were importing all of java.util,
which, in JDK1.2 includes a LinkedList class. This, of course was
conflicting with twisted.util.LinkedList. I changed the imports to
explicitly import only those java.util classes needed by Age.

Also, the map.por in resource used a few modules/classes not present in
the twisted.reality packages, namely twisted.reality.plugin.Tester and
twisted.reality.handler.PlayerSayHandler.

However, there's another problem that has arisen, and that is that when
the player &quot;You&quot; logs in, its location is null, since there's no other
players to grab &quot;You&quot; this is kind of a problem.

I've checked the map, and oldlocation is valid. Any ideas?
