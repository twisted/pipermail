<PRE>Hmm... Also, on the topic of how darkness should work:

If darkness was a class of room, then you can't do darkness separately
(e.g. being blinded makes you always be in the dark) and you also can't
have a darkness spell... Well, you could, but it would mess up or not work
in special rooms (underwater, loudspeaker equipped, etc.)

If darkness was built into common verbs (go, take, etc.) then it wouldn't
hurt the properties already on rooms, it would be &quot;player-side&quot;, so
players could be &quot;in the dark&quot; independantly of everyone else (being
blinded)... But this unfortunately requires that all custom versions of
those verbs (custom go and take verbs) have to be darkness compliant.

Lesser of two evils check?   :-)
