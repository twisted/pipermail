<PRE>Hmm.

I know that this is a problem, although I thought I had finally got it
rigged up to properly say &quot;in what?&quot;

Prepositions in quotes do need to be handled differently than prepositions
that are not in quotes.  I am not quite sure how to do this using the
current model. (If someone else does, just go fix it, as long as you don't
break anything else) Since this is almost never a problem except for
authoring stuff, I don't think it's a very important bug to fix, because
you can work around it rather easily.  Just 'sketch Class_Sittable' and
fill in your preposition string there.

Perhaps 'string' should have an editor of its own?

You are indeed correct.  The parser code shouldn't be *too* obtuse.

Does anybody think I should just break down and use the twisted.util.parse
libs to write a *real* parser for this? :-)
