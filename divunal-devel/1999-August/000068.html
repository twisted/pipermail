Wonderful!! As soon as you commit code, you should write something
describing how one could write a 'socials' file (I'm assuming this is
line-based?) and let the authors list know about it.  We should have at
least 100 or so socials so people don't have to emote everything
(removing some of the possibility for mistyping).  We really must start
giving those people who want mostly to write some code to work with, and
relieving some of the pressure of writing from people who just want to
code.

Are you going to have network access before you take off for the weekend?
(I don't suppose I'll get an answer to that question, but I sure would
like to ... ^_^)

Also, what is &quot;speed osm&quot;?

I have a sentimental attachment to ConsolePanel (it was the first thing I
ever wrote in Java) but I think Phil's probably right that it's just
faster to use Swing's stuff...  ConsolePanel is also pretty feature-weak.  
If we're going to continue to use it in the Java version, it needs to be
really, really revamped.
