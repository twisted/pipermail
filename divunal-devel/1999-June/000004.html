</I>Note the use of the indeterminate 'at some point' qualifier. I totally
agree. :) As you may have noticed, I'm a perfectionist on API design...but
just because I notice little 'bugs' doesn't mean I'm going to go and screw
around with everything to fix it right away. I just like writing it down
for future reference so I don't forget about it. :)

</I>&gt;<i>That was a design decision, actually.  addSyn should not recurse because
</I>&gt;<i>isHere should not recurse.  You have to be looking at something to operate

</I>Good point, I wasn't thinking properly.
