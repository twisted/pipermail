<PRE>I restarted the server and after a few minor changes, all of these patches
worked.  OpenLog wouldn't compile because you were importing
twisted.util.LogListener (not in CVS -- were you going to change this?)
and Sentence had some tricky null-pointering bugs.

All of these are fixed now.

Others who want accounts on the CVS server please email me.

Please keep in mind that there's going to be a TR release (1.0) sunday.
Make sure the codebase *WORKS* tonight.  If those with CVS accounts would
*please* download, build, etc, and tell me if they could get it installed
and running on their systems, that would be very helpful.

I am using a different style, but I think I'm going to try to switch to
yours -- it appears to be retabifying correctly whereas there are a few
situations in which mine will leave spaces behind... it won't create new
ones though.
