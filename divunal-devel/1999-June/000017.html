I didn't have a problem with the scripts once i opened them in Notepad and
changed all the linefeeds to crlf (ie replaced all the little boxes with a
return). If you don't do this, they won't work AT ALL. (if you don't do
this, it'll just print &quot;OFF&quot;. @echo off normally turns the command echo
off, but for some reason with bad line endings it just prints &quot;OFF&quot;). Once
I did that the MS script at least worked. I didn't try the sun one. I have
access to mac (what i normally use), winnt, win95, and linux boxes, and the
java faucet works on all of them.

You are in a maze of testy little Java VMs, all subtly different.
