I feel fairly strongly that interpreting hears results of verbs is a bad
way to do it, mainly because it is a complete waste of CPU time.
Translating the result into a string and then back again, instead of having
some other method of getting info out is just silly. (not to mention easy
to break, if someone comes along and changes the string that is returned
from a verb.) However, I don't have a good grasp on exactly how I would
prefer to get info out, or even what info I would like to get out, so I
guess it will have to stay for now. The other choice, of course, is to not
make AIs use verbs at all, but instead just do their own stuff. I find this
to be a poor choice as well.
