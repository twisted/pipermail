This is due to the fact that the dual-placement of an object's exit is a
rather hacky bit of work.

I will hopefully figure out some way to fix this, but until that time,
here's what you should do -- *finish your door* before you obstruct
anything with it.  Synonyms will only propogate to the room in which the
door is located.

&gt;<i> 2) How about having obstructedBy &quot;tags&quot; in room descriptions, so that if,
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. a door is opened or closed, the descriptive text would change?  In

You have either been hitting that crackrock a little too hard lately, or
you've been doing too much with HTML :-).  I won't even discuss the
performance problems with parsing out HTML in a massively multiplayer
environment -- they should be obvious.

Walk around Tenth's house (especially the Science Fiction Room entrance)
and take a look at how the doors work there.  There is no generalized way
to do this yet, but (as you can see from the Tenth example) there are so
many things beyond a general &quot;obscured&quot; message that you might want that
it didn't seem useful to have a generalized version at the time.
