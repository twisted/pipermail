That attitude is what's ruining the computing world. It's not going to
kill someone to know how to use a tool like a JVM that is required to
run hundreds (eventually thousands...millions) of programs.

We DO expect people to know simple things about what OS they're using
when they install a game or other software application.

We DO expect people to know how to drive a car when they get in one.

Then why shouldn't they be expected to know how to set a CLASSPATH and
correctly type a full package name? Hell, I'm not saying they'd even
have to know that; all THEY'D have to know is to read a README file.
