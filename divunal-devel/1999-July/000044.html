Keeping a table on individual objects is also bad because it means you have
to loop through each object looking for that table. The method I am
proposing is to keep a seperate mapping in the location of Player/name -&gt;
thing. The first time a given player does something requring name dynamic
properties to be evaluated, it will fill in this table with the results.
The results will then be valid until the location is focusRefreshed or some
other notification is sent that the name should be refreshed.

</I>&gt;<i>I suppose I don't understand what you mean by a &quot;shared perspective tag&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>here -- it seems to me that you are both proposing the same thing.
</I>By shared perspective tag I assumed he meant a special text label one could
give to a certain perspective to cache it with, like &quot;perspective through
green glasses&quot; that everyone who had on green glasses would share and would
therefore only need to be cached once. This seems overly complex for the
gain it would get.


&gt;<i>I think that a good way to do this might be just to cache a second table
</I>&gt;<i>of synonyms for the *object* rather than the player.
</I>&gt;<i>.....
</I>
Well if you want to do it that way, no change at all is needed...you can
just add all the synonyms to the *primary* synonym list in the normal way
and be done with it...no dynamic name stuff necessary.
