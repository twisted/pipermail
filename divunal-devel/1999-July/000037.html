<PRE>Since the game already knows how to make something look a certain way to a
certain player, why not do a similar thing with whatever looks at the room
to get an object?  That is, when someone says, &quot;get blue box&quot;, the game
&quot;thinks&quot;, &quot;Okay, based on his perspective and what's in the room, what the
hell is he talking about?&quot;  To put it another way, rather than just
returning the straight list of objects in the room for the verb to sort
through, you return the list of objects as filtered by the player's
perspective.
