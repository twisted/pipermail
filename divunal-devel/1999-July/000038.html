<PRE>Quick answer: efficiency problem.

Long answer: the game right now uses a 'Dictionary' structure to find what
you're looking for.  It looks up the object by the key of whatever you've
specified.  Reconstructing that entire dictionary structure each time a
player requests and object would be a HUGE efficiency hit.

Personally, I think there's a better way to do it, such as auto-adding the
synonyms when they're first sent to the player... that's kinda kludgy
though, and seems like it might have a very, very bad 'worst case
scenario'.
