<PRE>How about this:

As it stands, we already have to generate a list of objects based on the
person's perspective when the person enters the room.  Why not maintain
this list while the person's in the room, and query it instead of the
normal room list to avoid perspective processing every time a person
performs an action?  To save space and increase speed, the lists could be
associated with the given perspective &quot;tag&quot;/property, so that if there are
multiple people in the same room with the same perspective, you only have
to maintain one list for all of them.
