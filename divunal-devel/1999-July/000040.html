<PRE>Interesting!

I believe some of James's work with the client does just this, but we're
not actually using it for anything yet.  If James ever starts answering
his email again (???) perhaps we can take some of the new perspective
stuff and make it use that unique-per-player-per-Thing-ID do something
with locateThing so a player can see an object as whatever they actually
see it as.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you're looking for.  It looks up the object by the key of whatever you've
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specified.  Reconstructing that entire dictionary structure each time a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; player requests and object would be a HUGE efficiency hit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Personally, I think there's a better way to do it, such as auto-adding the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; synonyms when they're first sent to the player... that's kinda kludgy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though, and seems like it might have a very, very bad 'worst case
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scenario'.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;thinks&quot;, &quot;Okay, based on his perspective and what's in the room, what the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; hell is he talking about?&quot;  To put it another way, rather than just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; returning the straight list of objects in the room for the verb to sort
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; through, you return the list of objects as filtered by the player's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; perspective.
